Set up Nightshift in this project. Do the scaffolding first, then the gates conversation, then
print a summary.

The four state files and what each holds are in
`$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/nightshift/references/shift/state-map.md`. Ordinary plans belong in the drafting table, never in Hunt or the parking lot.

Resolve the installed plugin root to an absolute `$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT` — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`
on Claude Code, `$PLUGIN_ROOT` on Codex when set, otherwise the absolute path this skill was
attached from (`skills/setup/SKILL.md`). Run every command below through
`"$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT/runtime/ns"` — native Windows: `& "$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT\runtime\windows\ns.ps1"`
in the PowerShell tool, same verbs — which resolves the host and the workspace; `ns help` lists the
verbs, and `ns bind` prints the six resolved facts (`TASK_ROOT`, `NIGHTSHIFT_WORKSPACE`, `NS`,
`NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT`, `HOST`, `SOURCE`); `$NS` below is that `NS`. Never a bare relative path: the working
directory persists between calls.

Once the workspace and work target are resolved, the bundled mechanical scaffold is
`ns setup --work-target "$WORK_TARGET" --mode "$WORK_MODE"`, which exists on native Windows only;
on every other host this skill writes the same templates itself, as below.
It copies only absent files, writes state version 1 for a new site, persists the work target and
work mode (`-Mode repository` or `-Mode artifact`), and keeps `$NS/` private. It refuses a notes
folder under default repository mode: `pass -Mode artifact for a notes folder that is not a Git repository`.
Read its output back rather than restating it. The skill still owns every owner choice below; the
script asks nothing and never invents gates, permissions, profiles, migration approval, a receipts
choice, or a tooling policy.

If the user explicitly identifies a different existing workspace containing `.nightshift/`, show
both absolute paths and ask for confirmation. On yes, run
`"$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT/runtime/ns" link-workspace --host-root "$TASK_ROOT" --workspace "$PROPOSED_WORKSPACE"`.
The pointer is local-only and state remains in the authoritative workspace; never copy it.

## 0. Reject disposable ChatGPT scratch workspaces

Before creating or changing any file, resolve the project root to an absolute path. If it is under
`/workspace/scratch/`, this is a disposable ChatGPT scratch workspace that cannot affect the user's
repository. **Stop immediately: create no `$NS/` directory, rules, settings, receipts repo,
or other files.** Tell the user directly:

> Nightshift needs a persistent software project workspace. This ChatGPT conversation is using a
> temporary workspace, so files created here will not affect your repository.
>
> Open your project in Codex (a Git repository or a persistent local folder), or start Codex connected to its GitHub repository. Then mention
> Nightshift and say: “Set up Nightshift in this project.”

Do not mention Claude Code in this ChatGPT-specific redirect: the user is already in an OpenAI
product, so give them the shortest OpenAI-native route. Do not infer “temporary” merely because the
project is not a git repository — local non-git projects and the recommended parent-workspace
layout remain valid. The explicit disposable scratch path is the stop signal.

Detect the work mode, explain it, and ask before persisting it. Use
`ns_propose_work_mode` (POSIX) or `Get-NSProposedWorkMode` after importing
`Nightshift.psm1` (native Windows):

- `repository` — the workspace is a Git repository, or exactly one immediate non-hidden child is. Skip a symlink or reparse child; it is not a nested checkout.
  several child repositories still mean repository mode; show the choices and require an explicit
  target, never guess.
- `artifact` — there is no Git repository here. The persistent folder itself is the work target
  (research, docs, audits, planning). Say so plainly: gates, commits, and stack detection that
  require Git do not apply; complete each item with a receipt under `$NS/receipts/`.
  Completion in that folder is `$NS/receipts/`, not a git log.
  When `$NS/receipts` exists but is not a usable directory, say so and do not treat artifact setup as complete.
- scratch (`ns_propose_work_mode` status 2, or `Get-NSProposedWorkMode` throwing) — stop; create
  nothing.

Never persist a mode until the owner confirms. Never `git init` a notes folder to change an artifact proposal into repository mode. Then write `$NS/work-mode` as `repository` or
`artifact` (one word, one newline) and `$NS/work-target` as the absolute canonical path of the
chosen folder. On POSIX: `ns_record_work_target "$NIGHTSHIFT_WORKSPACE" "$WORK_TARGET" "$WORK_MODE"`.
On later setup runs, validate and retain that mode and target unless the owner explicitly changes
them. Repository mode: stack detection, Git checks, gates, commits, and verification operate in
the work target. Artifact mode: inspection, edits, and verification operate in that folder without
pretending it is a repository.

## 1. Scaffold `$NS/` (never clobber an existing shift)

```bash
"$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT/runtime/ns" scaffold
```

It writes each state file that is not already there and reports `wrote <name>` or `kept <name>`,
so a name the owner already has is left exactly as it is and a second run is a safe repair. Read
its output back. The copies carry resolved absolute paths — a person pasting a command out of
their own punch list has no `$NS` — and the shipped templates are unchanged. Never write those
tokens into `rules.json`: revival and clock-out text stay owner-editable, and the gate qualifies
bare `.nightshift/` mentions at injection time.

Create `$NS/shift-log.md` with a one-line header if absent.

**State version.** `$NS/state-version` is the schema marker. This plugin supports
integer `1`. If this run created `$NS/` (the directory did not exist when setup
started), write exactly `1` followed by a newline to
`$NS/state-version` after the templates. If `$NS/`
already existed and the marker is missing, that workspace is legacy version `0` — offer
`"$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT/runtime/ns" migrate-state`
and run it only after an explicit yes; the script writes only the marker and refuses while
armed. On native Windows the scaffold's `--migrate-legacy` switch is the same idempotent marker
write. A marker newer than `1`, or a malformed file, fails closed: print the diagnostic, do
not rewrite or downgrade it, and do not continue scaffolding as if the site were current.

## 2. Private by default

- Keep run state out of git. If `$NIGHTSHIFT_WORKSPACE` is itself a git repo, append a line
 `.nightshift/` to `$NIGHTSHIFT_WORKSPACE/.gitignore` (create the file if needed; do not
 duplicate the line). If it is not one — the recommended layout, where the code repo sits a
 level below — `.nightshift/` is already outside every repo, so write no `.gitignore` there.
 Run history is the owner's; it never enters the project repo.
- **Receipts repo — ask, default no.** The run state can be versioned in its own local-only git
 repo inside `$NS/`, so every punch-list change and log line has history. Most people
 don't want a git repo living inside their project, so ask — *"version the run state in a local
 receipts repo? (never pushed, never touches your project's history)"* — and on anything but a
 clear yes, skip it: the receipts still exist as plain files. Present the question neutrally —
 never describe the repo as recommended; the default is no. On yes: if `$NS/.git` does
 not exist, run `git -C "$NS" init` rather than `cd`-ing there.
 Ensure `$NS/.gitignore` contains the
 transient markers `STOP`, `.stall`, `.notified`, `deadline`, `.session-end`, `.shift-pulse`, `.mint-failed`, `.shift-session`,
 `.shift-session.tmp.*`, `.shift-worker`, `.shift-lease`, `.shift-lease.tmp.*`, `.mutex-scope`,
 `.mutex-scope.tmp.*`, `.watchman`, `.watchman-tick`, `.lock.d/`, and `.lease-lock.d/`; preserve
 existing lines. Make one initial commit only when setup created the receipts repository.
 Creating the repo does **not** turn on headless auto-commit — that is `receiptsAutoCommit`
 in `rules.json`, shipped `false`; the owner commits the receipts tree when they want.
 **Never add a remote to it, never push it.**
 On native Windows, after a clear yes, rerun the bundled scaffold with the same
 `--work-target` plus `--receipts`; the idempotent pass creates only this local receipts repo.
- **Cursor CLI file hooks — ask, default no.** The installed Cursor plugin already holds the
 IDE Agent tab. The Cursor CLI (`agent`) currently ignores marketplace and local plugin hooks
 and only runs project file hooks — a Cursor limitation, not a Nightshift skip. Ask —
 *"write a project `.cursor/hooks.json` so the Cursor CLI is held by the same Nightshift
 hooks?"* — and on anything but a clear yes, skip it. Present the question neutrally; the
 default is no. The IDE plugin keeps working either way. On yes: if
 `$NIGHTSHIFT_WORKSPACE/.cursor/hooks.json` does not exist, create `.cursor/` if needed and
 copy `$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/cursor/hooks.json` there. That file execs the same
 plugin scripts via `${CURSOR_PLUGIN_ROOT}`. If a `.cursor/hooks.json` already exists, show
 the diff against the shipped file and write only on an explicit yes to replace; never merge
 unknown owner hooks silently. Never create a second `.nightshift/`.

## 3. Gates — ask, never impose

Detect the stack in the persisted work target from the table in
`$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/nightshift/references/compose/gates-catalog.md`
(monorepo-aware). A plugin or marketplace manifest may sit at the work-target
root or one directory down at `plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/` /
`plugins/<name>/.codex-plugin/`; that nested layout is a match when no
language-stack row already won. Then ask the
user, showing the detected proposal, with three first-class answers:

- **accept** the proposal as-is,
- **edit** it — add, remove, or replace with THEIR own commands (any shell command is a valid gate),
- **none** — fully respected: the shift runs without automated checks.

If gates were accepted or edited, also ask the **site-inspection interval** (every N items or every
H hours). Write the result into the `## Gates` block of
`$NS/punch-list.md`, replacing the placeholder. If the answer was none,
leave the placeholder as-is.

The `## Gates` block is plain markdown the owner may edit anytime — run Setup again
(`/nightshift:setup` on Claude Code, or ask Nightshift to set up on Codex) to re-detect after a
stack change. The contract's immutability binds the agent, not the owner.

**Project defaults — ask once.** Independent from gates. Ask one question covering the verification
profile (`fast`, `balanced`, `strict`, or `custom`), typical hours, and tooling policy (existing
tools only, review missing tools first, or automatically add standard development tools). Persist
the answer with
`"$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT/runtime/ns" shift-policy defaults-set --verificationProfile <name> --hours <n|null> --toolingPolicy <name> --execution review-first|run-direct`.
The helper writes the `shift` block of `$NS/rules.json` — the one file the owner edits — and reports what it stored; never put the answer in
the punch list. It only prefills the one question Hunt and Quality ask before composing — it
decides nothing on its own, and either skill may change it for a single shift.

- **Artifact** — do not ask. Persist `fast` and existing-tools only, without prompting. A notes
 folder has no repository toolchain to add; repository-tool policies (`auto-add` and
 `review-missing`) are invalid there.
- **Repository** — ask the full question above (including review-first vs run-direct), then
 persist the answer.

## 4. Permissions — the night cannot click Allow

An unattended shift stalls forever on a permission prompt, and a watchman revival runs headless —
denied means denied. Ask one question:

> Overnight runs can't answer permission prompts. Enable frictionless permissions for this
> project's unattended runs? (recommended — Nightshift's guards stay armed in every permission
> mode)

- **Yes, on Claude Code** → merge `{"permissions": {"defaultMode": "bypassPermissions"}}` into
 `$TASK_ROOT/.claude/settings.local.json` (create the file if absent; never clobber keys
 the owner already has). Write the full path: a copy that lands in a nested code repo grants the
 project nothing, and the first prompt of the night proves it. Settings on disk are what revivals
 inherit — a mode picked at launch dies with the process.
- **Yes, on Codex** → there is no settings file to write: approvals are per launch. Tell the owner
 that unattended execution and sandbox scope are two separate choices, and say the trade plainly:
 a contract that does not commit runs unattended under `-a never -s workspace-write` — ticks alone
 finish a night, in the gate and the stall guard alike, and the commit rule is theirs to strip
 from the punch list and `clockOutMessage`. Under Codex's `workspace-write` sandbox `.git` is
 protected, so the default contract, which commits once per item, cannot run under it and is
 started with the launch command on the Codex host page,
 `$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/nightshift/references/hosts/codex.md`. The fence around that access is nightshift's
 own guards, which hold in every mode — the same trade `bypassPermissions` makes on Claude Code.
- **No** → respect it and say the cost plainly: *"a permission prompt mid-shift freezes the night
 until morning — if the shift stalls on one, that was tonight's trade."* Suggest the narrower
 alternative: pre-allow just the punch list's tools (test runner, linter, git) in the same file.

## 5. The rules file — every knob in one place

Copy `$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/nightshift/references/nightshift-rules-template.json` to
`$NS/rules.json` as-is, if it does not already exist — the owner's one config file, defaults
inline. It lives in nightshift's own folder on purpose: everything nightshift is in one place,
kept out of repo history by the same `.nightshift/` gitignore, versioned by the receipts repo when
one exists — and deleting `$NS/` removes all of nightshift, rules included. Validate the file with
`jq -e 'type == "object"'` and report a broken one plainly — never half-apply it. On native
Windows, validate with `Get-Content -Raw -LiteralPath "$NS\rules.json" | ConvertFrom-Json`;
PowerShell's JSON parser is built in, so native setup has no `jq` or Python prerequisite.

The template's `$schema` field points at
`$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/nightshift/references/nightshift-rules.schema.json` so editors
catch invalid names, types, and values; it is ignored at runtime. Editor discovery is documented
in https://github.com/orwa-mahmoud/nightshift/blob/main/docs/knobs.md.

The rules file is portable across hosts, so never generate a host-specific copy. Its `toolDeny`
map carries three native question names: `AskUserQuestion` for Claude Code, `request_user_input`
for Codex, and `AskQuestion` for Cursor. A non-empty value denies that exact tool with the owner's
message; an empty value allows it. All three entries stay present so deleting a key can never
activate an invisible default. JSON has no comments; the schema descriptions and
https://github.com/orwa-mahmoud/nightshift/blob/main/docs/knobs.md#tool-rules are the inline help.

The hooks read this file directly on every tool call: an owner's edit applies from their very next
action. Nothing is synced anywhere, nothing needs a restart, and there is no second copy. Env vars
of the matching names (`NIGHTSHIFT_FORBIDDEN_COMMANDS`, `NIGHTSHIFT_TOOL_RULES`, …) remain
session-start overrides for tests and one-off exceptions — say so only if asked. If Claude Code's
`$TASK_ROOT/.claude/settings.local.json` still carries `NIGHTSHIFT_*` env keys an earlier version
synced from this file, offer to remove them: the file is the one copy.

**Local rule profiles — offer, never impose.** Setup may list the shipped examples in
`$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/nightshift/references/profiles/` (every version-1 or version-2 JSON
file there) and preview one with
`"$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT/runtime/ns" apply-profile --profile <name> --mode fill|replace`.
The helper prints the preview and the complete next file; read it out rather than describing it.
Applying requires an explicit yes and `--apply`. Refuse `--apply` while armed. Profiles are a one-time local copy — no network, no
subscription. After applying a profile,
write a preset receipt from
`$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/nightshift/references/receipts/cycle-specialist-evidence.md` so branch mode,
allowed sources, verification profile, receipt retention, resource limits, and direct-mode
boundaries trace to `rules.json`. Owner rules remain authoritative;
presets never capture hidden policy.

**Template evolution — offer, never impose.** On a re-run with the file already present, compare
the shipped template's top-level keys and its nested `toolDeny` keys to the owner's file (read the
JSON in the skill; do not ask the owner to install `jq` or Python; on native Windows,
`(Get-Content -Raw -LiteralPath "$NS\rules.json" | ConvertFrom-Json).PSObject.Properties.Name`
and the same for `.toolDeny`): offer any missing key with its default — "this version added
`request_user_input`; add it?" — and never touch a value the owner already has. A missing native
question key is a configuration error, not permission to invent a fallback.

Same posture for the contract: if the shipped punch-list template's contract (the text above
`## Items`) has changed since the owner's copy was scaffolded, show the diff and offer a merge —
the owner's wording wins every conflict, and a punch list with open boxes is never touched at all.
The same offer applies when the owner's contract is leftover campaign text (a finished branch,
release, or issue-close list) even if the shipped template has not changed: show the diff and offer
to restore the template contract, or keep theirs. Never rewrite without an explicit yes.

## 6. Summarize

Print the workspace-state path and resolved work target, what was scaffolded, whether a receipts
repo was created, the gates that were written (or that none were), and the project defaults stored
in the `shift` block of `$NS/rules.json`. Tell the user to draft items in `$NS/drafting-table.md`, promote them into
the punch list, then start the shift (`/nightshift:start` on Claude Code, or ask Nightshift to start
on Codex). Mention that the open-ended product-evolution shift keeps its evidence and ranked work in
`$NS/product-research.md` and `$NS/opportunity-map.md`, while the quality skill can
turn existing lint/type debt into proposed items whenever they want it.
