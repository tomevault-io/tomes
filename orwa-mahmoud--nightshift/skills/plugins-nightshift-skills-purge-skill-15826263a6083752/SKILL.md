Remove Nightshift from this project. This deletes punch lists, rules, receipts, archives, and
history under the project's `.nightshift/` directory. It does not uninstall the global Nightshift
plugin.

Resolve the installed plugin root to an absolute `$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT` — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`
on Claude Code, `$PLUGIN_ROOT` on Codex when set, otherwise the absolute path this skill was
attached from (`skills/purge/SKILL.md`). Run every command below through
`"$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT/runtime/ns"` — native Windows: `& "$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT\runtime\windows\ns.ps1"`
in the PowerShell tool, same verbs — which resolves the host and the workspace; `ns help` lists the
verbs, and `ns bind` prints the six resolved facts (`TASK_ROOT`, `NIGHTSHIFT_WORKSPACE`, `NS`,
`NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT`, `HOST`, `SOURCE`); `$NS` below is that `NS`. Never a bare relative path: the working
directory persists between calls.

Print the exact canonical `$NS` path. Warn that punch lists, rules, receipts, archives, and history
will be lost, and that the plugin itself stays installed. Do not run the helper until the owner
confirms that exact path. Then:

```bash
"$NIGHTSHIFT_PLUGIN_ROOT/runtime/ns" purge-workspace \
  --confirm-path "$NS"
```

The helper first performs Reset, then deletes only that validated `.nightshift/` directory and a
local `.nightshift-link` on the opened task root when present. It refuses symlinks, malformed
links, workspace roots, home directories, `/`, and other broad paths. It never deletes repository
files outside that Nightshift state. A second Purge with the same confirmation is safe.

If the task root is linked, pass the folder you opened as `--project "$TASK_ROOT"`. This is the
one command whose target is the task root rather than the workspace, so it is the one place the
dispatcher's answer is not the one you want: purging only the workspace path leaves the host link
in place.
