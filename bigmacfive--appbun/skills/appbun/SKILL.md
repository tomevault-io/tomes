# appbun Web Desktop

Use `appbun` when the user wants a fast `URL -> desktop app` workflow that still leaves an editable Electrobun project.

## Default Workflow

1. Identify the target URL or local dev server.
   - If the user is inside a web app repo and a dev server may already be running, try `appbun dev --name "<App Name>" --out-dir ../appbun-output/<app-slug> --yes`.
   - Existing web app repo: prefer the running local URL, often `http://localhost:3000`.
   - Public website: use the canonical HTTPS URL.
   - Known app idea: check recipes with `appbun recipes` or `appbun discover <concept>`.
2. Choose a scoped output directory.
   - Existing repo: default to a dedicated sibling or workspace directory such as `../appbun-output/<app-slug>`.
   - Only write inside the source repo after the source app is committed or backed up.
   - Standalone wrapper: default to `./<app-slug>`.
3. Generate the wrapper.
   - Existing local app, auto-detect common dev ports:
     ```bash
     npx -y appbun@latest dev --name "<App Name>" --out-dir ../appbun-output/<app-slug> --yes
     ```
   - Existing app repo:
     ```bash
     npx -y appbun@latest <url> --name "<App Name>" --out-dir ../appbun-output/<app-slug> --yes
     ```
   - Known recipe:
     ```bash
     npx -y appbun@latest chatgpt --out-dir ./desktop/chatgpt --yes
     ```
4. Install and verify inside the generated wrapper.
   ```bash
   cd ../appbun-output/<app-slug>
   appbun doctor --project
   appbun package --install
   ```
5. Run diagnostics when builds fail or before release.
   ```bash
   npx -y appbun@latest doctor
   npx -y appbun@latest doctor --target macos
   npx -y appbun@latest doctor --project ../appbun-output/<app-slug>
   npx -y appbun@latest doctor --target linux
   ```

## Agent Prompt Mode

When the user wants a prompt for another coding agent instead of direct scaffolding, generate one:

```bash
npx -y appbun@latest prompt http://localhost:3000 --name "<App Name>"
```

Use `--copy` only when clipboard access is acceptable.

## Packaging Rules

- Use `bun run build:current` or `bun run build:stable` for the current machine.
- Prefer `appbun package`, `appbun package --dmg`, `appbun package --dmg --sign`, or `appbun package --notarize` when you are inside a generated appbun project.
- Run scaffolding, dependency installation, normal build, and DMG packaging as separate steps for local apps.
- Use platform scripts on native machines or CI runners:
  - macOS runner: `bun run build:macos`
  - Windows runner: `bun run build:windows`
  - Linux runner: `bun run build:linux`
- Do not promise local cross-compilation. Electrobun builds should run on a native runner for the target platform.
- For macOS DMG output, use `appbun package --dmg` or `bun run build:dmg` on macOS only after the normal build succeeds and the source repo is backed up.
- For signed DMGs, require `APPLE_SIGN_IDENTITY`; for notarized DMGs, also require `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, and `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`.

## Quality Bar

Before considering the desktop wrapper done:

- The generated app name, package name, icon, window size, and theme color match the product.
- The wrapper source is committed or clearly isolated from the main web app in a dedicated output directory.
- `bun run build` succeeds inside the generated project, or the remaining blocker is stated with logs.
- `appbun doctor --project` is run in the generated project and warnings are explained.
- Release workflows use native OS runners for platform builds.
- README or release notes explain that the output is inspectable Electrobun code, not a black-box binary wrapper.
- Temporary smoke-test output is created outside the source repo and deleted when the user only asked for validation.

## Useful Commands

```bash
appbun recipes
appbun discover design
appbun dev --name "My App" --out-dir ../appbun-output/my-app --yes
appbun doctor --project ../appbun-output/my-app
appbun package --cwd ../appbun-output/my-app --dmg
appbun doctor --target linux --json
appbun prompt http://localhost:3000 --name "My App"
appbun https://example.com --name "Example" --titlebar compact --yes
```
