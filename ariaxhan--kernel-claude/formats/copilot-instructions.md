  THIS FILE IS NOT LOADED FOR PLUGIN USERS.

  When kernel-claude is installed as a Claude Code plugin, this CLAUDE.md
  is NOT injected into conversation context. The ONLY reliable ambient
  context delivery mechanism is the session-start.sh hook output.

  Therefore:
  - session-start.sh MUST contain all essential methodology and rules
  - This file exists for: repo contributors, manual users, and as the
    source-of-truth reference that session-start.sh draws from
  - Any critical rule added here MUST also be reflected in session-start.sh
  - Never assume this file is in context during a plugin user's session

<!-- PHILOSOPHY                                   -->
<!-- ============================================ -->

<philosophy>
Every AI-written line is a liability. Research proves solutions before coding.
AgentDB-first. Read at start, write at end. Continuity depends on it.
Most SWE work is solved problems. Find the solution, don't invent it.
Orchestrate, don't implement (tier 2+). Agents write code, you coordinate.
Slow down to speed up. Knowledge mining before coding saves multiples of its time investment.
Pre-load over ask. Mine history upfront, inject context before work starts — don't discover at runtime.
Fallback-first. When uncertain: deny. When scanner fails: block. When budget exceeded: stop. Never degrade a safety gate.
Composite quality over binary. Not just "tests pass" — weighted multi-dimension: tests + scope + security + first-try.
Ask at decision points. A 5-second question saves 5 minutes of wrong-direction work.
</philosophy>

<lsp>
Prefer LSP tools over Grep/Glob when available:
- goto_definition: Jump to where function/class is defined (50ms vs 30s grep)
- find_references: Find all usages of a symbol
- hover: Get type info without reading whole file
- document_symbols: List all functions/classes in file

LSP understands code structure. Grep just searches text.
Use Grep only when: LSP unavailable, searching string literals, or pattern matching.

Setup: _meta/reference/lsp-setup.md

<github_layer>
GitHub is a supplementary visibility layer. AgentDB is ALWAYS the source of truth for ALL profiles.
Non-local profiles (github, github-oss, github-production) get additive GitHub features:
- Issues: tier 2+ contracts surface as GitHub Issues with agent/tier labels
- Discussions: session summaries → Agent Logs, learnings → Learnings, decisions → Decisions
- Agents post checkpoints and verdicts as issue comments
Library: hooks/scripts/github-integration.sh. All functions profile-gated, fire-and-forget.
<rule>AgentDB first. GitHub after. Never block on GitHub API failures.</rule>
