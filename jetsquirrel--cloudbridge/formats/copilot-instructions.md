# CloudBridge — agent notes

## Local macOS release: build, sign, notarize, staple

The normal path is CI: push a `v*` tag, `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds
both platforms, signs and notarizes the macOS dmg, and publishes the GitHub
release. Reach for the local path below when CI is blocked rather than broken
— GitHub's macOS runner queue and Apple's notary queue have each stalled for
hours in practice, and neither is fixable from this repository.

`scripts/package-macos.sh` does the packaging itself and refuses to run
without credentials; the local path is the same script, run by hand, with no
job time limit.

### Prerequisites — already true on the maintainer's Mac

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Signing identity | `Developer ID Application: Tian Deng (V5KP6ZYMDT)`, login keychain |
| Notary API key | `~/Downloads/AuthKey_492MX6SWPC.p8` |
| Key ID and Issuer ID | `scripts/notary.local` (gitignored, see below) |

Confirm the identity and its private key are present before anything else:

```bash
security find-identity -v -p codesigning | grep "Developer ID"
```

Exactly one identity must print. An `Apple Development` certificate cannot
sign for distribution. If the identity is missing, the certificate has to be
created in the Apple Developer portal — no script can do that step.

`scripts/notary.local` holds the three values the script needs:

```bash
export NOTARY_KEY=~/Downloads/AuthKey_492MX6SWPC.p8
export NOTARY_KEY_ID=492MX6SWPC
export NOTARY_ISSUER=<issuer UUID from App Store Connect -> Users and Access -> Integrations -> Keys>
```

The Key ID is not a secret (it is in the key's filename); the `.p8` is, and
stays where it is.

### Steps

1. **Check disk space.** Not only for a release: `target/` reaches 14 GB on
   an ordinary full build — 11 GB for the desktop debug build and its tests,
   3.3 GB for the wasm demo (measured 2026-09-24, with duckdb's bundled
   `json` and `parquet` extensions). A release build is on top of that.

   ```bash
   df -h /System/Volumes/Data   # want > 15Gi available
   ```

   9 GiB free is **not** enough: a cold `cargo test` from that gets most of
   the way through duckdb and then dies. The usual culprits are this and
   sibling Rust projects' `target/` directories — `cargo clean` in one of
   those is usually the fastest 20 GB you will find.

   On a full disk the failure is not a clean "out of space" —
   `libduckdb-sys` dies inside `ar cq` with no explanation beyond
   `errno=28`, and a build that gets further reports "failed to link or
   copy" on the final artifact. Both mean the disk, not the code.

2. **Build from a worktree of the tag, never from the working tree.** The
   maintainer usually has uncommitted work, and it must not end up in a
   release:

   ```bash
   git worktree add /tmp/cloudbridge-vX.Y.Z vX.Y.Z
   cd /tmp/cloudbridge-vX.Y.Z && cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Package with the script from `main`**, invoked by path so a tag that
   predates a packaging fix still gets the fix:

   ```bash
   source /Users/admin/side-proj/cloudbridge/scripts/notary.local
   cd /tmp/cloudbridge-vX.Y.Z
   /Users/admin/side-proj/cloudbridge/scripts/package-macos.sh \
     target/release/cloudbridge cloudbridge-macos-arm64.dmg X.Y.Z
   ```

   The script signs the app and the dmg, submits the dmg for notarization,
   waits, staples, then runs `stapler validate` and two `spctl` assessments.
   It must be run from the repository root — it reads `assets/` and `themes/`
   from the working directory.

   macOS will raise a GUI keychain prompt the first time `codesign` uses the
   key. Someone has to click **Always Allow**; an agent cannot.

4. **Expect to wait, and know that waiting is not failure.** Apple's notary
   service has taken anywhere from minutes to over 12 hours per submission
   for this team. Two facts follow:

   - The 5-hour `--timeout` in the script is a client-side wait, not a
     cancellation. When it expires the submission keeps processing on Apple's
     side, and the ticket can still be collected later.
   - **A ticket binds to the exact bytes submitted.** Do not rebuild after a
     timeout — a rebuild re-signs with a fresh timestamp, producing different
     bytes and no ticket. Staple the file that was submitted:

     ```bash
     xcrun notarytool history --key "$NOTARY_KEY" --key-id "$NOTARY_KEY_ID" --issuer "$NOTARY_ISSUER"
     xcrun notarytool info <submission-id> --key "$NOTARY_KEY" --key-id "$NOTARY_KEY_ID" --issuer "$NOTARY_ISSUER"
     # once the dmg's submission reads Accepted:
     xcrun stapler staple cloudbridge-macos-arm64.dmg
     ```

5. **Verify the artifact as a user's Mac would**, not just as the script
   does:

   ```bash
   xcrun stapler validate cloudbridge-macos-arm64.dmg
   spctl --assess --type open --context context:primary-signature --verbose=2 cloudbridge-macos-arm64.dmg
   MNT=$(hdiutil attach -nobrowse -readonly cloudbridge-macos-arm64.dmg | grep -o '/Volumes/.*' | head -1)
   spctl --assess --type execute --verbose=2 "$MNT/CloudBridge.app"
   hdiutil detach "$MNT" -quiet
   ```

   All four must report `accepted` with `source=Notarized Developer ID`.

6. **Publish.** Pushing a tag runs CI, which builds and publishes the
   release; creating a tag through the GitHub release UI also triggers that
   workflow, so a hand-uploaded asset gets overwritten by CI's. Either push
   the tag and let CI own the release, or upload by hand and accept that CI
   will refresh the assets.

### Failure modes seen in practice

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| `...: rejected  source=no usable signature` on the dmg, app accepted | The dmg itself was never signed. Signing the app inside is not enough; `spctl`'s open assessment reads the dmg's own signature |
| `error: -25294` importing the `.cer` | The keychain dropdown in the import dialog was left on "Local Items"; pick "login" |
| `.p12` greyed out in the export dialog | Only the certificate was selected. Expand it and select certificate **and** private key |
| `security export: The contents of this item cannot be retrieved` | `security export` without a filter exports every identity and aborts if any one fails. Export the single identity from the GUI instead |
| `ar: ... libduckdb.a` failing with no message | Disk full |
| Notarization `In Progress` for hours | Apple's queue, not a configuration problem. Verified by `notarytool history` showing sibling submissions Accepted |

## The web demo (wasm32)

The same crate builds a browser version:

```bash
./scripts/build-web.sh              # debug; add --release for the shipped one
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory web/site
```

`src/lib.rs` chooses a data backend per target with `cfg`: DuckDB, the provider
APIs and the OS keyring on the desktop; an in-memory ledger seeded with demo
data in the browser (`src/web/`). Everything above that — `src/ui/`, `app.rs`,
`alerts.rs`, `model.rs` — is shared and compiles for both, so **a change to a
page must keep building for wasm**, not just for the desktop.

The two backends select and group charges their own way, but stop there.
Anything computed *from* those groups is `src/analytics.rs`: the run-rate
forecast and its bands, the period comparison, the cost-change decomposition,
the trailing daily average, balance burn and the data-quality findings, plus
the billing-period arithmetic. It is pure — `now` is an argument, nothing
opens a store — and it carries the tests for all of it. **A new statistic goes
there, not into a `query.rs`**; what belongs in a `query.rs` is the read that
feeds it. The demo bill is the same arrangement: `src/demo_data.rs` builds the
rows, each target's `ledger::demo` writes them.

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` builds the web demo as a **required** job — it is
the only thing that notices when the two backends' signatures drift apart, or
when a page stops compiling for wasm. The MSRV check beside it stays advisory.
The MSRV job reads `package.rust-version` from `Cargo.toml` (currently 1.95).
The locked `gpui-pre` dependency uses `std::hint::cold_path`, stabilized in
Rust 1.95; `cargo +1.94.0 check --locked` fails on this API on macOS ARM64.
Keep the job non-blocking until the Ubuntu CI check is verified; local macOS
validation does not establish compatibility on other platforms. Revalidate
the minimum when updating `Cargo.lock`. The wasm build still needs nightly.

The Ubuntu jobs compile the desktop application for Linux, which needs four
system libraries installed first — see "Install Linux system libraries" in
`ci.yml`. `libfontconfig1-dev` is the one that bites: `yeslogic-fontconfig-sys`
probes `fontconfig` from its build script and panics instead of falling back,
so its absence fails `cargo check` before any of this project's code is read.
The other three cover the `freetype2` probe and the X11 backend's direct
`-lxkbcommon`/`-lxcb` links. A dependency that links a C library on Linux has
to be added to every job that compiles the tree — each runs on its own runner,
and nothing here needs these libraries on macOS or Windows.

Things that will bite you:

- **Nightly is required for the wasm build only.** `gpui-pre-web` pulls Zed's
  `wasm_thread`, which uses a `stdarch_wasm_atomic_wait` feature stable does not
  have. The desktop stays on stable. The nightly is **pinned by date** —
  `WEB_TOOLCHAIN` in `scripts/build-web.sh`, and the same date in both
  workflows — because an unstable feature can be renamed overnight and a
  floating `+nightly` turns that into a build that broke with nobody having
  changed anything. To build against a nightly you already have:
  `WEB_TOOLCHAIN=nightly ./scripts/build-web.sh`. Bumping the pin means
  changing it in all three places.
- **`wasm-bindgen` CLI must match the `wasm-bindgen` crate version.**
  `scripts/locked-version.py <package>` prints what `Cargo.lock` resolved and
  fails when the answer is not a single version; the build script and both
  workflows read it from there rather than guessing.
- **The browser has no system fonts.** `gpui-pre-web` starts with an empty font
  database, and GPUI resolves `.SystemUIFont` to IBM Plex Sans there; without
  that family registered the text system panics rather than falling back. The
  four fonts are in `web/site/fonts/` (OFL) and registered in `src/wasm_entry.rs`;
  they are `include_bytes!`d, so they must exist to compile.
- **Icons are fetched, not embedded.** gpui-kit's wasm asset source requests
  `<endpoint>/assets/icons/<name>.svg` on demand, so the build script copies the
  catalog out of the `gpui-kit-assets` version `Cargo.lock` names into
  `web/site/assets/` (gitignored). The endpoint is `.`, relative to the page, so the
  same module works at a site root and under `/demo/`; anything added to
  `web/site/index.html` has to stay relative for the same reason.
- **The demo is published with the docs site.** `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml`
  runs a release web build on every push to `main` and drops `web/site/` into
  `docs/demo/`, because a Pages deployment uploads the whole site at once — a
  docs-only push that skipped the build would publish a site with no demo in
  it.
- **`smol::unblock` is forwarded by `web/smol-bridge`.** Cargo refuses one
  dependency name with two sources, so the desktop's `smol` is reached through
  that crate instead of beside it. The pages call `smol::unblock` unchanged; on
  wasm it runs the closure inline, because there is no second thread.
- **`cargo build --release` at the root still means the desktop application.**
  `[workspace] default-members = ["."]` keeps it that way; the wasm build is
  `--lib --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`. A release wasm build is heavy and the
  disk advice above applies to it too.
