# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Code-foundations is a Claude Code plugin providing software engineering skills based on *Code Complete* (McConnell) and *A Philosophy of Software Design* (Ousterhout). It includes a building workflow with gated phases (BUILD, REVIEW, orchestrator commit) and an experimental code review system.

## Architecture

### Skill Families

| Family | Prefix | Focus |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Code Complete | `cc-*` | Process rigor, metrics, checklists |
| APOSD | `aposd-*` | Design philosophy, complexity reduction |
| GoF Design Patterns | `gof-*` | 23 Gang of Four patterns, decision trees, structural recipes |
| Clean Architecture | `ca-*` | System-level boundaries, SRP-by-actor, dependency direction |
| Legacy Code | `welc-*` | Safely modifying untested code (conditional, invoked from cc-refactoring-guidance) |

### Directory Structure

- `skills/` - Individual skill definitions (SKILL.md + checklists.md)
- `commands/` - User-invocable commands (slash commands)
- `agents/` - Agent templates (build-agent, post-gate-agent, debug-agent)
- `references/` - Shared reference materials
- `docs/` - Case study examples

### Code Review System

**Single entry point:** `/code-foundations:review`

**Two presets:**

**Sanity Flow (--sanity):** 14 core checks, intelligent batching
```
┌────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌───────────┐   ┌───────────────┐
│ EXTRACTION │ → │ ORCHESTRATE │ → │ CHECKING  │ → │ INVESTIGATION │
│  (haiku)   │   │  (sonnet)   │   │ (sonnet)  │   │   (sonnet)    │
└────────────┘   └─────────────┘   └───────────┘   └───────────────┘
      ↓                 ↓                 ↓                  ↓
  1 per 5 files   • Triage files    1 agent per      1 agent per
  Extract units   • Smart batching  batch, runs      5 findings,
  + diffs                           14 core checks   provides fixes
```

**PR Flow (--pr):** 546 checks, prefix-based grouping
```
┌────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌───────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌───────────────┐
│ EXTRACTION │ → │ CHECK ORCH  │ → │ CHECKING  │ → │ ORCHESTRATE │ → │ INVESTIGATION │
│  (haiku)   │   │   (haiku)   │   │ (sonnet)  │   │   (haiku)   │   │   (sonnet)    │
└────────────┘   └─────────────┘   └───────────┘   └─────────────┘   └───────────────┘
      ↑                ↑                 ↑                ↑                  ↑
   Batch by        Group by         1 agent per      Dedupe &          1 agent per
   files (5)       ID prefix        prefix group     batch             5 findings
                   (GC-, EH-...)    + skills
```

| Preset | Checks | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `--sanity` | 14 core (consensus-distilled) | Pre-commit sanity |
| `--pr` | 546 (8 checklists) | Full PR review |

### Skill Checklist Counts

| Skill | Checks |
|-------|--------|
| cc-defensive-programming | 41 |
| aposd-simplifying-complexity | 44 |
| aposd-reviewing-module-design | 42 |
| code-clarity-and-docs | 87 |
| cc-control-flow-quality | 104 |
| aposd-verifying-correctness | 33 |
| cc-quality-practices | 125 |
| performance-optimization | 70 |
| **Total (PR preset)** | **546** |

### Review Execution Flow

1. **Load preset** → Parse checklists and skills
2. **Validate** → Check checklist paths exist, warn on missing skills
3. **Get target** → Ask for diff args (staged, unstaged, branch)
4. **Create phase tasks** → TaskCreate for each phase (enforces flow)
5. **Extraction** → Parallel haiku agents (batch by files)
6. **Check Orchestrate** → Single haiku agent parses checklists, groups by ID prefix
7. **Checking** → Parallel sonnet agents use `add-finding.sh` to record results
8. **Orchestrate** → Single haiku agent batches findings
9. **Investigation** → Parallel sonnet agents use `add-verdict.sh` to record verdicts + fixes
10. **Summary** → Display results, offer actions (open dashboard, fix all)

**Phase enforcement via TaskCreate/TaskUpdate** - agent cannot skip phases.
**Schema enforcement via bash scripts** - `add-finding.sh` and `add-verdict.sh` validate all inputs.

### Development Workflows

**Choose based on scope:**

| Situation | Command | Ceremony |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Bug investigation | `/code-foundations:debug` | Minimal |
| Technical uncertainty | `/code-foundations:prototype` | Minimal |
| Feature needs planning | `/code-foundations:whiteboarding` | Medium |
| Executing approved plan | `/code-foundations:building` | Full |

### Prototype → Whiteboarding → Building Workflow

Three-stage pattern for feature development:

| Command | Purpose | Output |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `/code-foundations:prototype` | Prove feasibility with minimum code | Prototype log in `docs/prototypes/` |
| `/code-foundations:whiteboarding` | Discovery-oriented brainstorming | Plan file in `docs/plans/` |
| `/code-foundations:building` | Checklist-based execution | Working code + tests |

**Full Flow:**
```
/code-foundations:prototype "can I show a notification?"
  → One question to prove
  → Minimum code (~50 lines max)
  → Binary answer: YES/NO/PARTIAL
  → Capture learnings to docs/prototypes/

        ↓ (if feasible)

/code-foundations:whiteboarding "build notification system"
  → Codebase scan (shared step, all tracks)
  → Clarify intent (shared step, all tracks)
  → Problem statement confirmed (shared step, all tracks)
  → [Quick: plan → check → present]
  → [Standard/Full: classify → explore → detail → save → check → confirm]
  → Save to docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md
  → User confirms

        ↓ (after plan approval)

/code-foundations:building docs/plans/<plan>.md
  → Feature branch required
  → Execute phases with quality gates
  → Model auto-detected per phase (haiku/sonnet/opus)
  → Per-phase commits after REVIEW passes (or BUILD completes for standard/minimal gate)
  → Final verification + report
```

**When to use each:**

| Situation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| "Can I do X?" / technical uncertainty | `/code-foundations:prototype` |
| Ready to plan full feature | `/code-foundations:whiteboarding` |
| Plan exists, ready to implement | `/code-foundations:building` |

**Quality Gates (per phase during /code-foundations:building):**
```
BUILD:   references/pre-gate-standards.md + references/implement-standards.md + [plan Skills]
         (discovery + design → TDD implementation in one agent)
REVIEW:  references/post-gate-standards.md + [plan Skills]
         (Full gate only — standard/minimal use tests as gate)
VERIFY:  performance-optimization + cc-refactoring-guidance + build + tests + lint
COMMIT:  Orchestrator commits directly after gates pass
```

`[plan Skills]` = skills assigned per phase during whiteboarding's SAVE step, then validated/resolved during building's SETUP skill resolution task.

Model and skills are assigned during whiteboarding's SAVE step. Building's SETUP runs a one-time skill resolution task that validates assignments, fills gaps, and updates the plan before creating phase tasks (skills affect gate policy). Cannot proceed to next phase until current phase passes all gates including REVIEW PASS (Full gate).

## Skill File Structure

```
skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md         # Main skill definition with YAML frontmatter
├── checklists.md    # Detailed checklists
├── hard-data.md     # Research/data backing the skill
└── language-notes.md # Language-specific guidance (optional)
```

## Review Output Format

Reviews are **grouped by action type** (what to do next):

```markdown
## Findings
Confirmed issues.
1. **[ID]** file:line - Issue
   Evidence: ...
   Fix: ...

## Questions
Need more context.
1. **[ID]** file:line - Issue
   **Unknown**: [missing context]
```

**Key principle**: State what you DON'T know (**Unknown** section).

## Key Concepts

**APOSD Complexity Symptoms:**
- Change amplification (simple change → many modifications)
- Cognitive load (must know too much)
- Unknown unknowns (worst)

**CC Metrics:**
- Cohesion (routine does ONE thing)
- Coupling (minimized dependencies)
- Parameters ≤7, Inheritance depth < 3

**CC Skills (13 total):**
All CC skills reference `references/cc-foundations.md` for shared vocabulary (cohesion spectrum, coupling criteria, key metrics).

Additional skills:
- `cc-debugging` - Scientific debugging (Chapter 23): STABILIZE → LOCATE → HYPOTHESIZE → EXPERIMENT → FIX → TEST → SEARCH

## Publishing

### Plugin Structure
