# Debug Loop

Drive the running Obsidian app through `obsidian-cli` to verify plugin changes against real
rendered state. The DOM is the source of truth.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `obsidian-cli plugin:reload id=zotlit` | Reload the plugin after a build |
| `obsidian-cli commands filter=zotlit` | List available plugin commands |
| `obsidian-cli command id=zotlit:<cmd>` | Run a command |
| `obsidian-cli eval code='<js>'` | Run JS in the app, returns the value |
| `obsidian-cli dev:screenshot path=<abs>` | Capture the window (absolute path required) |
| `obsidian-cli dev:errors` | Captured errors |
| `obsidian-cli dev:console` | Console output |

## Loop

1. **Build** — `pnpm --filter @zotlit/obsidian build:dev` (copies bundle into the test vault's
   `.obsidian/plugins/zotlit`).
2. **Reload** — `obsidian-cli plugin:reload id=zotlit`.
3. **Open** — `obsidian-cli command id=zotlit:<cmd>`, or `eval` to mount a view in a specific split.
4. **Probe** — `obsidian-cli eval code='…'` with `getComputedStyle(el)` /
   `el.getBoundingClientRect()` to assert what actually rendered. A computed-style assertion is
   worth more than eyeballing a screenshot.
5. **Screenshot** — `obsidian-cli dev:screenshot path=<absolute-path>`. Save inside the workspace.
6. **Errors** — `obsidian-cli dev:errors` / `obsidian-cli dev:console`.

## Gotchas

### No `await` in eval

Code runs in a non-async wrapper — top-level `await` is a syntax error. Fire the promise and
verify in a follow-up `eval`, or grab references synchronously. Hold the leaf from `getLeaf(...)`
and `revealLeaf(it)` in the same call rather than re-querying `getLeavesOfType(...)` after an
async `setViewState` (races, returns `[]`).

### Stale screenshots

A capture taken right after reload or `revealLeaf` may show old DOM while the change is already
live. Cross-check against an `eval` DOM/computed-style query — if they disagree, the DOM query
wins. Re-shoot. A DevTools window open over Obsidian can also steal the capture — close it first.

### Vault is the main checkout

The running app's vault is `~/repo/zotlit-repo/zotlit-v2/tests/zt-vault` even when working from
a worktree. `build:dev` from any worktree copies there, and `data.json` edits must target that
vault, not the worktree's own `tests/zt-vault`. Confirm with
`eval code='app.vault.adapter.basePath'`.

### Occluded window

When `document.visibilityState === "hidden"`, scroll events don't dispatch and the compositor
stops repainting — scroll-driven UI (e.g. TanStack Virtual) looks frozen and screenshots return
stale frames. Drive scrolling with `el.scrollTop = x; el.dispatchEvent(new Event("scroll"))` and
assert via DOM queries.

### Live-data escape hatch

Plugin setting `zotero.data-dir` points the live plugin at any data directory. Symlinking the
canonical 24k sqlite as `zotero.sqlite` in a scratch dir gives a full-scale live test. Restore
`data.json` + `plugin:reload` afterwards.
