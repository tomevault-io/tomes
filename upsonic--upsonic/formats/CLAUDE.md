This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Upsonic is a reliability-focused AI agent framework for building production-ready AI agents and digital workers. The framework provides advanced reliability features, MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration, and supports 20+ AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure, AWS Bedrock, Cohere, Mistral, Groq, and more — see "Model Providers and Configuration" below).

## AI Operational Guides

Consult the relevant guide before doing the work — these are operational, not optional.

- **`documents/ai/guides/feature.md`** — Use when adding a feature or non-trivial enhancement: a new public API, a new provider (Vector/Model/Storage/Tool/Embedding/OCR/Loader), a new agent type or prebuilt agent, a new policy in `safety_engine/`, a new RAG component, or a new public method/config knob on an existing class. Defines the four mandatory phases (Understand → Design → Implement → Verify), the eight cross-cutting aspect checklists, the hard gates, and the common anti-patterns.
- **`documents/ai/guides/refactor.md`** — Use when changing internal structure without changing observable behaviour: renaming, extracting, splitting an oversized module, removing dead code, mechanical migrations. Defines the four mandatory phases (Motivate & Scope → Characterize → Transform → Verify Behaviour Preserved), the per-phase hard gates, and anti-patterns specific to refactors. Cross-references `feature.md §4` for shared aspects.
- **`documents/ai/guides/bug-fix.md`** — Use when fixing a reported bug, failing test, traceback, or behaviour that contradicts a stated contract. Defines the four mandatory phases (Reproduce → Diagnose → Fix → Verify), with hard rules around root-cause discipline, regression tests, and minimal-diff scope. Cross-references `feature.md §4` for shared aspects.
- **`documents/ai/guides/testing.md`** — Use when deriving, writing, reviewing, or locking tests for any feature / refactor / bug-fix. Defines the four mandatory phases (Derive Scenarios → Generate RED Tests → Manual Review → Lock & Iterate via Code), with hard rules around user-driven scenario seeding, Serena + memory consultation, the manual review gate, and the immutability of locked tests. Complements `feature.md §4.5` (placement and types).
- **`documents/ai/guides/coding-standards.md`** — Always-on. How code in this repo is named, typed, structured, formatted, tested, and reviewed. Pure Python coding standard; framework-agnostic.
- **`documents/ai/guides/serena.md`** — Always-on. When and how to use Serena MCP for symbol and reference lookups, the read-only constraint on source code, the surface-what-you-found rule, and the optional Serena memory layer (currently unused; gitignored by default).
- **`documents/ai/guides/memory.md`** — Always-on. How Claude Code's auto memory works in this repo, where it lives, what auto-loads vs lazy-loads, when to consult it (recurring corrections, past test mistakes, similar prior requests), the surface-what-you-found rule, and the end-of-workflow MUST save reflection.
- **`documents/ai/guides/subagents.md`** — Always-on. When to dispatch subagents (heavy reads, separable investigations, long tasks, planning/review), when not to, and how to brief them.
- **`documents/ai/guides/new_prebuilt_agent_adding.md`** — Use when shipping a new prebuilt autonomous agent under `src/upsonic/prebuilt/<your_agent>/`. Canonical reference for the runtime/agent-class/template layering, `AGENT_REPO`/`AGENT_FOLDER` wiring to `PrebuiltAutonomousAgentBase`, and the `new_<X>(...)` high-level API conventions.
- **`documents/ai/guides/commit.md`** — Use before any `git commit`, `git push`, or history-rewriting command. Hard rule: never commit without explicit user approval.

### Default Pre-Work Consultation

Before any non-trivial task, the always-on guides compose into a single pre-work pass — Claude Code memory + Serena code lookup (and Serena memory if active). Surface findings together at the start of the reply so the user can see what informed the response, e.g.:

> *"From memory: prior feedback don't mock the DB. From Serena: existing similar handler at `src/upsonic/X.py:42`."*

Trivial work (single-line typo, comment edit) skips this and says so explicitly: *"Skipping memory / Serena lookup — single-line cosmetic edit."*

### Keep `documents/ai/explanation/` in sync with code

The files under `documents/ai/explanation/<subsystem>/<subsystem>.md` are treated as the authoritative description of each subsystem's behaviour contract. Whenever a code change alters an *observable* contract that an explanation doc asserts, resync the matching file in the same commit (or an immediate follow-up `docs: sync explanation/…` commit). The `documents/ai/guides/` files are Claude-operational process docs and only change when the *process* changes, not when a single contract does.

Triggers that almost always require a doc update:

- A public method / constructor signature changed (added, removed, renamed parameter; new default; new keyword-only requirement).
- A side effect was added, removed, or made conditional (e.g. `Chat.__init__` no longer unconditionally overwrites `agent.memory`).
- A `ToolConfig` / dataclass default flipped, or a specific subclass overrides the generic default.
- An exception path turned into a graceful fallback, or vice versa.
- A previously-documented invariant ("X always Y") is now conditional.
- A new public emission (e.g. `UserWarning`, log line, event) is added that callers may observe.

How to do it:

1. Identify the touched module(s) under `src/upsonic/`.
2. `grep -rln "<class or symbol>" documents/ai/explanation/` to find the doc and the exact lines whose claim is now stale.
3. Edit surgically — fix only the sentences/tables whose claim is now wrong; do not rewrite the surrounding prose.
4. Include the doc edit in the same logical change (same PR / commit block). If the code commit is already pushed, follow up with a `docs: sync explanation/…` commit before the PR is reviewed.

Skip when the change is purely internal (private helpers, comment trims, refactors that preserve every observable contract). Surface what you found at the start of the reply (memory / Serena conventions still apply), e.g.: *"Touched `Chat.__init__` storage wiring → resyncing `documents/ai/explanation/chat/chat.md` lines 257–280."*

## Core Architecture

### Key Components

- **Agent System**: Core agent implementation in `src/upsonic/agent/` with `Direct` class as the main agent interface
- **Task Management**: Task definitions and execution logic in `src/upsonic/tasks/`
- **Tools & MCP Integration**: Tool processing and external tool management in `src/upsonic/tools/`
- **Reliability Layer**: Advanced reliability features in `src/upsonic/reliability_layer/`
- **Safety Engine**: Content filtering and policy enforcement in `src/upsonic/safety_engine/`
- **Storage**: Multi-provider storage system in `src/upsonic/storage/` (In-Memory, JSON, SQLite, Redis, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- **Team/Multi-Agent**: Team coordination and delegation in `src/upsonic/team/`
- **Knowledge Base & RAG**: KB interface in `src/upsonic/knowledge_base/`; RAG components split across `src/upsonic/vectordb/` (vector DBs), `src/upsonic/embeddings/` (embedders), `src/upsonic/loaders/` (document loaders), `src/upsonic/text_splitter/` (chunkers), and `src/upsonic/ocr/` (OCR for ingestion)
- **Prebuilt Autonomous Agents**: Ready-to-run agents that bundle a system prompt, first-message template, and skills under `src/upsonic/prebuilt/<agent>/template/`. The shared base class lives in `src/upsonic/prebuilt/prebuilt_agent_base.py`. To add a new prebuilt, follow `documents/ai/guides/new_prebuilt_agent_adding.md`.

### Main Entry Points

- `Task`: Task definition and execution (`src/upsonic/tasks/tasks.py`)
- `Agent`/`Direct`: Main agent class (`src/upsonic/agent/agent.py`)
- `Team`: Multi-agent coordination (`src/upsonic/team/team.py`)
- `KnowledgeBase`: RAG and document management (`src/upsonic/knowledge_base/knowledge_base.py`)

## Development Commands

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies with uv
uv sync

# Install with optional dependency groups (umbrella groups: vectordb, storage,
# models, embeddings, loaders, tools, ocr — per-provider groups also exist;
# see [project.optional-dependencies] in pyproject.toml for the full list)
uv sync --extra vectordb --extra storage --extra embeddings
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run a specific tier or subsystem (tiers: unit_tests, smoke_tests, integration_tests, doc_examples)
uv run pytest tests/unit_tests/

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src/upsonic
```

### Development Tools
```bash
# Type checking
uv run mypy src/

# Pre-commit hooks (runs automatically on commit)
pre-commit run --all-files

# Lock dependencies
uv lock
```

### Running Examples
```bash
# Run basic agent example
uv run test.py
```


If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'upsonic'`, re-install and re-sync:

```bash
uv pip uninstall upsonic && uv sync
```

Then re-run your original command (e.g., `uv run test.py`).

## Model Providers and Configuration

The framework supports 20+ AI providers through a unified interface. Concrete implementations live under `src/upsonic/models/`, with metadata in `src/upsonic/models/model_registry.py`. Set the relevant API key for the provider you use; see each provider's source file for exact env-var names.

Major providers:

- **OpenAI** — `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **Anthropic** — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- **Google** (Gemini)
- **Azure OpenAI** — Azure-specific credentials
- **AWS Bedrock** — standard AWS credentials
- **Cohere**, **Mistral**, **Groq**, **Cerebras**, **xAI / Grok**, **Together**, **OpenRouter**, **NVIDIA**, **SambaNova**, **HuggingFace**, **Ollama** (local), **VLLM** (local), **LMStudio** (local), and others under `src/upsonic/models/`.

Models are specified using the format `provider/model` (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`, `anthropic/claude-opus-4-7`).

## Key Features to Understand

### Reliability Layer
Advanced reliability features including verifier agents, editor agents, and iterative quality improvement rounds for production-ready outputs.

### MCP Integration
Built-in support for Model Context Protocol tools - can integrate with hundreds of existing MCP servers from the ecosystem.

### Safety Engine
Policy-based content filtering and safety enforcement with configurable rules for sensitive content, adult content, crypto, and social media policies.

### Storage Abstraction
Unified storage interface supporting multiple backends for session management, memory persistence, and user profiles.

## Testing Structure

Tests are organized into four tiers under `tests/`, matching the placement rules in `documents/ai/guides/feature.md` §4.5:

- **`tests/unit_tests/<subsystem>/`** — pure-logic tests for any new public surface that can be exercised without network, disk, or a running service.
- **`tests/smoke_tests/<subsystem>/`** — coverage for features that touch external services, databases, APIs, or filesystems. Run via `make smoke_tests` (Docker-backed real services).
- **`tests/integration_tests/`** — cross-subsystem behaviour (e.g., agent + storage + tools wired together).
- **`tests/doc_examples/`** — exercised public-API usage examples for new public surface.

`tests/conftest.py` holds shared fixtures. Use pytest with async support enabled.

For the test-discipline workflow (scenario derivation → RED first → manual review → lock), see `documents/ai/guides/testing.md`.

## Environment Variables

Key environment variables:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - AI provider credentials
- `UPSONIC_TELEMETRY=False` - Disable telemetry collection
- Database connection strings for storage providers (Redis, PostgreSQL, etc.)

## File Organization
