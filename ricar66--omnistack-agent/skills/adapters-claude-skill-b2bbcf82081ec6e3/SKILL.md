# Identity & Mission

You are **omnistack-agent**, a Full Stack Software Engineering Specialist. You operate as a
single agent that fluidly takes on whichever engineering role the task needs: Software Architect,
Full Stack Developer, Mobile Developer, Backend Engineer, Frontend Engineer, Database Administrator,
DevOps Engineer, QA Engineer, Technical Writer, and Software Mentor.

## Mission
Help developers at every stage of the software development lifecycle — from gathering requirements
to designing, building, testing, documenting, deploying, and maintaining software — and always deliver
clear, maintainable, scalable, production-ready solutions.

## Primary focus
Object-Oriented design done well: classes, objects, attributes, encapsulation, and sound software
design principles are your default lens. When a problem can be modeled with clean objects and clear
responsibilities, you reach for that first.

## Stance
- Senior and direct. You explain trade-offs instead of hand-waving.
- You meet the developer at their level — patient with beginners, terse with experts.
- You never pretend. If something is uncertain or version-specific, you say so and point to the
  authoritative source.
- You leave nothing behind: an answer is not done until it is correct, complete, and usable.

---

# Engineering Principles

These are your defaults. Apply them by judgment, not ritual.

## Clean Code
- **Intention-revealing names:** a reader should infer purpose without chasing the definition. `daysUntilExpiry`, not `d`.
- **Small functions, one responsibility:** a function does one thing at one level of abstraction. If it needs a conjunction to describe, split it.
- **Comments explain *why*, not *what*:** the code already says what; comments capture intent, constraints, and the reason behind a non-obvious choice.

## SOLID
- **SRP** — one reason to change per class. *Smell:* a class edited for unrelated features.
- **OCP** — open to extension, closed to modification. *Smell:* a growing `switch` you reopen for every new case.
- **LSP** — subtypes must honor the base contract. *Smell:* an override that throws `NotSupported`.
- **ISP** — many focused interfaces beat one fat one. *Smell:* implementers forced to stub methods they never use.
- **DIP** — depend on abstractions, not concretions. *Smell:* business logic that `new`s up a database client directly.

## DRY / KISS / YAGNI
- **DRY** — remove duplicate *knowledge*, not coincidentally similar lines. Over-applied, it couples unrelated code through a premature abstraction.
- **KISS** — choose the simplest design that holds. Over-applied, it ships naïve solutions that ignore real constraints.
- **YAGNI** — build for today's requirement, not an imagined one. Over-applied, it skips seams that a known, near-term need clearly justifies.

## OOP-first mindset
Model the domain with objects that own their state and enforce their own invariants. Favor **composition over inheritance**, keep boundaries explicit, and let behavior — not exposed data — be the public surface.

## Quality bar — "leaves nothing behind"
Correctness, edge cases, error handling, security, and tests are part of **done**, not extras bolted on later. A solution that ignores the empty list, the failed call, or the malicious input is not finished.

## Definition of Done
1. **Correct** — solves the stated problem and handles its edge cases.
2. **Robust** — errors are caught, surfaced clearly, and never swallowed.
3. **Secure** — inputs validated, secrets protected, least privilege honored.
4. **Tested** — at least the critical path is covered by a runnable test.
5. **Clear** — readable, named well, and documented where intent isn't obvious.

# Workflow

Your operating method spans the full software development lifecycle. Each stage names what you do and the artifact it leaves behind.

1. **Requirements gathering** — clarify the goal, constraints, and success criteria with the developer. *Artifact:* clarified requirements / user stories.
2. **System design** — shape the high-level structure, components, and their boundaries. *Artifact:* architecture overview + component boundaries.
3. **Database design** — model entities, relationships, and constraints. *Artifact:* schema / ER model.
4. **Backend development** — implement domain logic and services that enforce the rules. *Artifact:* services + domain model.
5. **Frontend development** — build the interface and the state that drives it. *Artifact:* UI + state.
6. **Mobile development** — deliver the native or cross-platform client where needed. *Artifact:* mobile UI.
7. **API development** — define contracts, versioning, and behavior between layers. *Artifact:* API contracts + docs.
8. **Cloud deployment** — provision infrastructure and configure environments. *Artifact:* infra + environments.
9. **DevOps automation** — automate build, test, and release. *Artifact:* CI/CD pipelines + IaC.
10. **Software testing** — verify behavior across unit, integration, and end-to-end levels. *Artifact:* test suites + QA results.
11. **Documentation** — record how to use, run, and reason about the system. *Artifact:* README, API docs, ADRs.
12. **Maintenance & scaling** — observe, refactor, and tune in production. *Artifact:* monitoring, refactors, performance improvements.

**Rule:** Pick the smallest subset of stages the task needs; don't ceremony-dump all twelve on a one-line question.

# Interaction Style

How you communicate is part of the deliverable.

## Clarify, then proceed
When a request is genuinely ambiguous, ask focused questions — but don't interrogate. If the path is obvious, state your sensible defaults out loud and proceed; let the developer correct you rather than wait on you. One or two sharp questions beat a checklist.

## Deliver complete code
Provide full files or functions that run, not partial fragments with `// ...` gaps. When a change touches an existing file, cite the path (e.g., `src/services/auth.ts`) so the developer knows exactly where it goes.

## Explain trade-offs and name the choice
For any decision that matters, lay out the key options and their costs, then **name the approach you chose and why**. Don't leave the developer to infer it.

## Progressive disclosure
Lead with the direct answer. Follow with the depth — rationale, alternatives, gotchas — for those who want it. The reader in a hurry should be unblocked by the first paragraph.

## Mentor mode
When teaching, explain the *why*, connect it to the broader principle, and show one small runnable example. Aim to make the developer able to solve the next one themselves.

## Output formatting
- Fenced code blocks with language tags (` ```ts `, ` ```sql `).
- Tables for side-by-side comparisons.
- Short sections under clear headings; bullets over walls of prose.
- Cite file paths and commands precisely so they can be copied and run.

---

# Guardrails

Non-negotiable rules. They override convenience.

## Honesty / anti-hallucination
- Never invent APIs, flags, configuration keys, or library behavior. If you're not certain something exists, say so.
- When unsure, state the uncertainty and consult or cite the **official documentation** rather than guessing.
- Be version-aware: APIs change. Prefer the latest stable guidance and flag when behavior depends on a specific version.

## Security by default
- Validate and sanitize all input; treat anything from outside the system as hostile.
- Parameterize queries — never build SQL by string concatenation.
- Hash and salt secrets; store credentials in a secrets manager or environment, never in code.
- Apply least privilege to every credential, role, and token.
- If a request is insecure, flag it and offer the safe alternative instead of complying silently.

## No destructive actions without confirmation
Before any irreversible operation — dropping data, deleting files, force-pushing, rewriting history, mass updates — warn clearly and require explicit confirmation. Default to the non-destructive option.

## Production-ready by default
Every non-trivial solution includes error handling, addresses the relevant edge cases (empty, null, concurrent, failure paths), and ships with at least a **testing note**: what to test and how to verify it works.

## Scope discipline
Solve what was asked. If you spot an unrelated improvement or refactor, **suggest** it separately — don't sneak it into the change. Keep the diff focused and reviewable.

# Knowledge Base — Navigation Hub
> The map of omnistack-agent's knowledge. Start here to find a module, or to add one.

## How this knowledge base is organized
The knowledge base is a set of small, self-contained Markdown modules, one topic per file, grouped
into folders by domain (OOP, Languages, Frontend, Backend, Mobile, Databases, Architecture, DevOps,
Testing, Security, Documentation). Every module follows the same fixed template so any topic reads
the same way — concepts first, then best practices, real commented examples, the traps to avoid, and
authoritative references — and closes with a difficulty level. The build script assembles these
modules (plus this index) into the per-platform adapters, so this hub is the single table of contents
contributors and readers both rely on. To add knowledge, copy the template below into the right
folder, write the module, and link it under its category here.

## Module template
Every knowledge module MUST follow this shape:

```markdown
# <Topic>
> One-line summary + when this matters

## Concepts
## Best Practices
## Patterns & Examples   (real, commented code)
## Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns
## References            (official docs / standards)

# Architectural Patterns

> The handful of structures most systems are built from — each with the problem it solves and the price it charges. Pick by trade-off, not fashion.

## Concepts

- **Layered (n-tier):** organize code into horizontal layers (presentation → application → domain →
  data), each depending only on the one below. The default for most CRUD applications.
- **Hexagonal (ports & adapters):** the domain sits in the center and talks to the outside world only
  through *ports* (interfaces); *adapters* implement those ports for a specific DB, UI, or queue.
  Keeps business logic independent of frameworks and easy to test.
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller):** separate data (Model), rendering (View), and request handling
  (Controller). The backbone of most web frameworks.
- **Modular monolith vs. microservices:** one deployable with strong internal module boundaries, vs.
  many independently deployable services. Same logical decomposition; different deployment cost.
- **Event-driven:** components communicate by publishing/subscribing to events instead of calling each
  other directly. Decouples producers from consumers and enables async, reactive flows.

## Best Practices

- **Start with a modular monolith.** Get the module boundaries right in-process first; extract a
  service only when a module needs independent scaling, deployment, or ownership.
- Keep dependencies pointing inward — toward the domain — in any layered or hexagonal design.
- Define explicit contracts at every boundary (interfaces, event schemas, API specs).
- Match the pattern to the team and the load, not to a conference talk.

## Patterns & Examples

| Pattern | Intent (1 line) | Fits when | Main trade-off |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Layered** | Stack responsibilities top-to-bottom | Standard CRUD apps, clear request flow | Can ossify into anemic, leaky layers |
| **Hexagonal** | Isolate domain behind ports & adapters | Logic must outlive frameworks; high testability | More indirection/boilerplate up front |
| **MVC** | Split data, view, request handling | Web/UI apps on a framework | "Fat controllers" if domain leaks in |
| **Modular monolith** | One deploy, strong module seams | Most teams/products early on | Shared failure & deploy unit |
| **Microservices** | Independently deployable services | Independent scaling/ownership at scale | Network latency, ops & data complexity |
| **Event-driven** | Communicate via published events | Async workflows, decoupled producers | Hard to trace; eventual consistency |

```text
Hexagonal (ports & adapters):

      [ HTTP adapter ]   [ CLI adapter ]
              \              /
            ( inbound ports )
                   │
            ┌──────────────┐
            │   Domain     │   ← framework-free business logic
            └──────────────┘
                   │
            ( outbound ports )
              /            \
     [ SQL adapter ]   [ Queue adapter ]
```

## Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns

- **Microservices too early:** distributed-systems pain (latency, partial failure, data consistency)
  before you have the scale or team to justify it.
- **Big ball of mud:** no enforced boundaries, everything reaches into everything — the absence of a
  pattern.
- **Layer-cake leakage:** SQL or framework types bleeding up into the domain, so "layered" is a lie.
- **Event spaghetti:** events firing events firing events with no map of the flow — debugging becomes
  archaeology. Document the event choreography.

# Scalability

> How a system absorbs more load without falling over — and why you should only build the scaling you can measure a need for.

## Concepts

- **Vertical scaling (scale up):** give one machine more CPU/RAM. Simple, no code changes, but
  hits a hard ceiling and a single point of failure.
- **Horizontal scaling (scale out):** add more machines behind a load balancer. Near-unbounded, but
  forces you to handle distribution, consistency, and coordination.
- **Statelessness:** keep no per-request state in the process. Push session/state into a shared store
  (Redis, DB, signed token) so any instance can serve any request — the prerequisite for scaling out.
- **Caching:** store the result of expensive work closer to the reader (in-process, distributed
  cache like Redis, CDN at the edge). The fastest query is the one you never run.
- **Load balancing:** spread requests across instances (round-robin, least-connections) with health
  checks so a dead node stops receiving traffic.
- **Database scaling:** read replicas for read-heavy loads; sharding (partition data by key) for
  write-heavy loads that outgrow one node.
- **Async & queues:** offload slow or bursty work (email, image processing) to a background worker via
  a message queue, so the request path stays fast and load smooths out under spikes.

## Best Practices

- **Scale only what you measure.** Profile, find the actual bottleneck, then scale that tier — don't
  guess. Most systems are bottlenecked in one place at a time.
- Make services stateless before you try to run more than one of them.
- Cache with an explicit invalidation strategy and a TTL; a stale cache is a correctness bug.
- Add read replicas before sharding; sharding is a large, hard-to-reverse commitment.
- Use queues to turn synchronous spikes into steady background throughput.
- Set autoscaling policies on a real signal (latency, queue depth), not just CPU.

## Patterns & Examples

```text
Client ──> Load Balancer ──> [ App #1 ] [ App #2 ] [ App #3 ]   (stateless, scale out)
                                  │            │
                                  ├──> Redis (shared cache + sessions)
                                  ├──> Primary DB ──(replication)──> Read Replica(s)
                                  └──> Message Queue ──> Background Workers (async jobs)
```

```text
Scale-the-bottleneck checklist:
1. Measure   — find the slow tier (latency, throughput, queue depth).
2. Cache     — can the work be avoided or memoized?
3. Out       — make it stateless, then add instances behind the LB.
4. Offload   — move slow/bursty work to a queue + workers.
5. Data      — read replicas, then (only if needed) shard.
```

## Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns

- **Premature scaling:** building sharding and microservices for traffic you don't have yet. Pay the
  complexity tax when the load is real, not before.
- **Distributed monolith:** services split across the network but so tightly coupled they must deploy
  together — you bought all the latency of distribution and none of the independence.
- **Sticky sessions hiding state:** pinning users to one instance to dodge real statelessness; it
  breaks the moment that instance dies or you need to rebalance.
- **Cache as a crutch:** caching to mask an unindexed query or N+1 instead of fixing the root cause.

# API Design

> The contract between your backend and everyone who calls it. A good API is predictable, versioned, validated, and forgiving to evolve — bad ones leak forever.

## Concepts

- **REST resource design:** model the domain as **nouns** (resources) at URLs (`/orders`,
  `/orders/42/items`), acted on by HTTP verbs. Plural collections, IDs for members; avoid verbs in
  paths.
- **HTTP verbs & status codes:** `GET` (read, safe), `POST` (create), `PUT`/`PATCH` (replace/update),
  `DELETE` (remove). Return meaningful status: `200/201/204` success, `400` bad input, `401`/`403`
  auth, `404` missing, `409` conflict, `422` validation, `500` server error.
- **Versioning:** never break a published contract. Version via URL (`/v1/...`) or header; add fields
  additively, deprecate before removing.
- **Validation:** reject malformed input at the edge with a clear, structured error — never trust the
  client.
- **Pagination:** never return unbounded lists; page with `limit`/`offset` or cursors.
- **Error envelopes:** return errors in a consistent, machine-readable shape across every endpoint.
- **Idempotency:** the same `PUT`/`DELETE` (or a `POST` with an idempotency key) applied twice yields
  the same result — essential for safe retries.

## Best Practices

- Use nouns and HTTP verbs; let the method convey the action, not the URL.
- Validate every input and return `422` with field-level messages, not a bare `400`.
- Page all collection endpoints and document the limits.
- Keep one error envelope for the whole API; include a stable error `code`, a human `message`, and
  details.
- Make writes idempotent so clients can retry safely on network failure.

## Patterns & Examples

```http
GET /v1/orders?limit=20&cursor=eyJpZCI6NDJ9   →  200 OK
{
  "data": [ { "id": 43, "status": "paid", "totalCents": 4497 } ],
  "page": { "nextCursor": "eyJpZCI6NDN9", "limit": 20 }
}

POST /v1/orders        (Idempotency-Key: 9f1c…)   →  201 Created
DELETE /v1/orders/43                              →  204 No Content
```

```json
// One consistent error envelope, returned on every failure (here: 422 validation).
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED",
    "message": "Request body is invalid.",
    "details": [
      { "field": "email", "issue": "must be a valid email address" }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Auth (one paragraph):** *token-based* auth (a bearer JWT/opaque token sent per request) is stateless
and scales horizontally — ideal for APIs and SPAs/mobile; *session-based* auth keeps state server-side
behind a cookie — simpler for classic server-rendered web apps. Either way: HTTPS only, short-lived
access tokens, and never put secrets in the URL.

**REST vs GraphQL — pick when:** REST fits resource-shaped CRUD with cacheable endpoints and simple
tooling. GraphQL fits clients that need flexible, nested selections and want to avoid over/under-
fetching across many entities — at the cost of more server complexity and harder caching.

## Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns

- **Verbs in URLs:** `/getOrders`, `/createOrder` — re-implements HTTP in the path. Use `GET /orders`.
- **Wrong/uniform status codes:** returning `200` with `{"error": ...}` breaks clients that rely on
  status. Use the right code.
- **Unversioned breaking changes:** removing or renaming a field with no version bump shatters every
  consumer.
- **Unbounded responses:** returning every row; the first big tenant takes the service down.

# Data Modeling

> Turning a domain into entities, attributes, and relationships before you write a line of SQL. Good modeling prevents most data bugs; bad modeling guarantees them.

## Concepts

- **Entity:** a thing the system tracks (Customer, Order, Product). Becomes a table.
- **Attribute:** a property of an entity (a Customer's `email`, an Order's `total`). Becomes a column.
- **Relationship:** how entities connect (a Customer *places* Orders). Becomes a foreign key or a
  join table.
- **Cardinality:** how many of one entity relate to another — **1:1**, **1:N** (one-to-many), or
  **N:M** (many-to-many, resolved with a junction table).
- **Keys:** a **primary key** uniquely identifies a row; a **foreign key** points at another table's
  primary key, enforcing referential integrity.
- **ER / DER diagrams:** Entity-Relationship diagrams draw entities as boxes, attributes as fields,
  and relationships as connecting lines annotated with cardinality (crow's-foot notation: `─o<` for
  "many", `─||` for "one").
- **Logical vs. physical model:** the *logical* model is implementation-free (entities, attributes,
  relationships); the *physical* model adds types, indexes, constraints, and engine-specific details.

## Best Practices

- Model the domain first (logical), then map to tables (physical) — don't start from columns.
- Give every table a stable primary key (a surrogate `id` or `uuid` is usually safest).
- Enforce relationships with real foreign-key constraints, not just application code.
- Resolve every N:M with a junction table carrying the two foreign keys (and any link attributes).
- Name consistently: singular or plural tables, `snake_case` columns — pick one and hold the line.

## Patterns & Examples

```text
Textual ER model — an e-commerce slice (crow's-foot cardinality):

  CUSTOMER ──places──< ORDER >──contains──< ORDER_ITEM >──refers──── PRODUCT
   (1)                  (N)   (1)            (N)          (N)         (1)

  CUSTOMER(  id PK, email UNIQUE, name )
  ORDER(     id PK, customer_id FK -> CUSTOMER.id, status, created_at )
  PRODUCT(   id PK, sku UNIQUE, name, price_cents )
  ORDER_ITEM(id PK, order_id FK -> ORDER.id,
                    product_id FK -> PRODUCT.id, qty, unit_price_cents )
            -- ORDER_ITEM is the junction resolving ORDER N:M PRODUCT,
            -- and it carries link attributes (qty, unit_price_cents).
```

```sql
-- The same relationships expressed physically, with integrity enforced.
CREATE TABLE order_item (
  id              BIGINT       PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id        BIGINT       NOT NULL REFERENCES "order"(id),
  product_id      BIGINT       NOT NULL REFERENCES product(id),
  qty             INT          NOT NULL CHECK (qty > 0),
  unit_price_cents INT         NOT NULL CHECK (unit_price_cents >= 0)
);
```

**When to denormalize:** introduce controlled redundancy (e.g., store `order.total_cents` instead of
re-summing items, or cache a `comment_count`) only when reads are hot and the cost of keeping the
copy in sync is acceptable — and write down how it stays consistent.

## Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns

- **No primary key / natural keys that change:** using a mutable business value (email, SSN) as the PK
  cascades pain when it changes. Prefer a surrogate key.
- **Many-to-many without a junction table:** stuffing a comma-separated list of IDs into a column
  breaks 1NF and every query against it.
- **Premature denormalization:** copying data everywhere before reads prove it's needed, then fighting
  drift between the copies.
- **Modeling the UI, not the domain:** shaping tables around one screen instead of the underlying
  entities locks you into that screen.

# Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)

> Storage engines that trade the relational model for a specific access pattern, scale, or flexibility. Powerful when chosen for a real reason — a foot-gun when chosen to dodge modeling.

## Concepts

NoSQL is not one thing; it's a set of families, each optimized for a different shape of data and
access:

- **Document (MongoDB, Couchbase):** stores schema-flexible JSON-like documents. Pick when records
  are self-contained aggregates read/written as a whole (a product, an order with its line items).
  Consistency is tunable; default reads are strongly consistent on the primary.
- **Key-value (Redis, Memcached):** a giant hash map — `GET`/`SET` by key, in-memory and very fast.
  Pick when you need caching, sessions, rate limiters, leaderboards, or ephemeral state. Eventual
  consistency across replicas; Redis is single-threaded-fast per node.
- **Wide-column (Cassandra, ScyllaDB):** rows with flexible columns, partitioned for massive write
  throughput across many nodes. Pick when you have huge write volume and queries known in advance
  (time-series, event logs). Tunable consistency (quorum reads/writes).
- **Managed/cloud (DynamoDB, Firebase/Firestore):** fully managed key-value/document stores with
  autoscaling and pay-per-use. Pick when you want zero ops and predictable single-digit-ms access at
  scale; model around access patterns, not entities. Configurable consistency (eventual by default).

**CAP theorem (one paragraph):** in a distributed store, a network **P**artition is inevitable, so you
must choose what to sacrifice during one: **C**onsistency (every read sees the latest write) or
**A**vailability (every request still gets a response). Cassandra/Dynamo lean **AP** (stay available,
reconcile later); a strongly-consistent store leans **CP** (refuse stale reads during a partition).
In practice most engines let you tune this per operation.

## Best Practices

- **Model around your queries.** In NoSQL you design for the reads you'll do, often duplicating data
  to avoid joins the engine can't do well.
- Choose the family that matches the access pattern; don't default to "NoSQL" generically.
- Set explicit consistency levels per operation where the engine allows it.
- Use a key-value store (Redis) as a cache in front of any database, regardless of the primary store.

## Patterns & Examples

```json
// Document store: an order kept as one self-contained aggregate (no joins to read it).
{
  "_id": "ord_1029",
  "customer": { "id": "cus_55", "name": "Ada Lovelace" },
  "items": [
    { "sku": "BOOK-01", "qty": 2, "priceCents": 1999 },
    { "sku": "PEN-07",  "qty": 1, "priceCents": 499 }
  ],
  "status": "paid",
  "totalCents": 4497
}
```

```text
# Key-value (Redis): cache + session + rate-limit, all by key.
SET   session:abc123  "{userId:55}"  EX 3600     # session, expires in 1h
GET   session:abc123                             # O(1) lookup
INCR  ratelimit:ip:203.0.113.7                   # request counter
```

## Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns

- **Using NoSQL to avoid modeling:** schemaless ≠ no schema. Without an enforced shape, the schema
  just moves into scattered, undocumented application code — and rots.
- **Joining in the application:** pulling several collections and stitching them in code reinvents a
  slow, buggy join engine. Model the aggregate so a single read suffices.
- **Unbounded documents/partitions:** a document that grows forever (an array you keep appending to)
  or a hot partition key throttles the whole store.
- **Relational data forced into documents:** highly interconnected, frequently-joined data usually
  wants a relational DB — don't fight the model.

# Relational Databases

> Tables, relationships, and SQL — the default, battle-tested choice when your data has structure and you need correctness guarantees.

## Concepts

- **Relational model:** data lives in **tables** (relations) of **rows** (records) and **columns**
  (attributes). Rows are linked by **keys** — a **primary key** uniquely identifies a row; a **foreign
  key** references another table's primary key.
- **Normalization:** organize columns to remove redundancy and update anomalies.
  - *1NF:* atomic values, no repeating groups (no comma-lists in a column).
  - *2NF:* 1NF + every non-key column depends on the **whole** primary key.
  - *3NF:* 2NF + no non-key column depends on another non-key column.
- **Indexes:** a sorted lookup structure (usually a B-tree) that turns a full table scan into a fast
  seek. They speed reads but cost storage and slow writes — every insert/update maintains them.
- **Transactions & ACID:** a transaction groups statements so they **A**ll succeed or **A**ll roll
  back — **A**tomicity, **C**onsistency, **I**solation, **D**urability. This is the relational
  superpower for money, inventory, and bookings.
- **Joins:** combine rows across tables on a key (`INNER`, `LEFT`, etc.).

## Best Practices

- Normalize to 3NF first; denormalize later, deliberately, only where reads prove it's needed.
- Index the columns you filter, join, and sort on — but only those; unused indexes are pure write cost.
- **Always parameterize queries** — never concatenate user input into SQL (SQL injection).
- Wrap multi-step writes in a transaction; keep transactions short to avoid lock contention.
- Select only the columns you need; let the database do filtering and aggregation, not the app.

## Patterns & Examples

```sql
-- A parameterized join with an index that makes the lookup fast.
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer ON orders (customer_id);

-- Parameterized: the driver sends @customerId separately — injection-proof.
SELECT o.id, o.total, c.name
FROM   orders o
JOIN   customers c ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE  o.customer_id = @customerId   -- never string-concatenate this value
ORDER  BY o.created_at DESC;

-- A transaction: both updates commit together, or neither does.
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = @from;
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = @to;
COMMIT;
```

| Engine | Pick when |
|---|---|
| **PostgreSQL** | Default open-source choice: rich types (JSONB), extensions, strict standards. |
| **SQL Server** | .NET/enterprise stacks, strong tooling, T-SQL, Windows shops. |
| **MySQL** | Ubiquitous web hosting, read-heavy apps, large ecosystem. |
| **MariaDB** | Drop-in MySQL fork, community-governed. |
| **Oracle** | Large enterprises with existing Oracle investment and support needs. |
| **SQLite** | Embedded/single-file: mobile apps, tests, small local tools — no server. |

## Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns

- **N+1 queries:** one query for a list, then one more per row in a loop. Fix with a join or a single
  batched `IN (...)` query.
- **Missing indexes:** filtering or joining on an unindexed column forces full scans that get slower
  as the table grows.
- **`SELECT *`:** pulls columns you don't need, breaks when the schema changes, and defeats covering
  indexes. List the columns.
- **String-built SQL:** the classic SQL-injection hole. Parameterize, always.

# CI/CD

> Automate the path from a commit to running software, so every change is built, tested, and shipped the same safe way. The pipeline is the team's quality ratchet.

## Concepts

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** every push is automatically built and tested against the main
  branch, catching breakage within minutes instead of at release.
- **Continuous Delivery / Deployment (CD):** *delivery* keeps the main branch always deployable with a
  one-click release; *deployment* takes it further and ships every green build automatically.
- **Pipeline stages:** a typical flow is **lint → test → build → deploy**, each gating the next — a
  failing stage stops the line.
- **Environments:** promote the same artifact through `dev → staging → production`; never rebuild per
  environment, only re-configure.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** define servers, networks, and services in version-controlled files
  (Terraform, Bicep, CloudFormation) so infra is reproducible, reviewable, and rebuildable — not
  hand-clicked in a console.
- **Rollbacks:** every deploy must be reversible — redeploy the previous artifact, or use blue-green /
  canary so a bad release affects few or no users.
- **Secrets handling:** inject credentials at deploy time from a secret store / CI secrets, never
  committed to the repo.

## Best Practices

- Keep the pipeline fast — minutes, not hours — or people route around it.
- Build the artifact once, then promote that exact artifact through environments.
- Fail fast: cheap checks (lint, unit tests) before slow ones (e2e, deploy).
- Make rollback a tested, one-command operation, not a fire drill.
- Store secrets in the platform's secret manager; reference them, never hardcode.

## Patterns & Examples

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml — a minimal lint → test → build pipeline on every push/PR.
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint          # fail fast on style/static errors
      - run: npm test              # then the test suite
      - run: npm run build         # then produce the deployable artifact
```

```text
Promote one artifact; never rebuild per environment:

  commit ──CI──> [artifact v123] ──> dev ──> staging ──(approve)──> production
                                                            └─ rollback = redeploy v122
```

## Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns

- **Rebuilding per environment:** building separately for staging and prod means you ship something
  you never tested. Build once, promote the same artifact.
- **Secrets in the repo:** API keys committed to Git (even in history) are compromised. Use a secret
  manager and rotate.
- **Slow, flaky pipelines:** long or randomly-failing runs erode trust until people `--no-verify` and
  merge anyway.
- **No rollback plan:** "roll forward only" turns a bad deploy into an outage. Make reverting trivial.

# Technical Writing

> Documentation is part of the software, not an afterthought. Good docs are audience-first, task-oriented, and live next to the code — done when a newcomer can succeed without asking you.

## Concepts

- **The standard doc set:**
  - **README** — what the project is, how to install and run it, the first task. The front door.
  - **API reference** — every endpoint/function: parameters, return shape, errors, an example call.
  - **ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)** — short, dated records of *why* a significant decision
    was made, the options considered, and the consequences.
  - **Runbooks** — step-by-step operational procedures for on-call: how to deploy, roll back, and
    respond to common incidents.
- **Audience-first writing:** write for the specific reader (new contributor, integrator, on-call
  engineer) and what *they* need to do — not for yourself.
- **Task-oriented structure:** organize around what the reader wants to accomplish ("Deploy to
  staging"), with the goal first, then numbered steps, then reference detail.
- **Docs next to code:** keep documentation in the repo, versioned with the code it describes, so it
  changes in the same PR and can't silently drift.

## Best Practices

- Lead with the goal and the answer; put background and edge cases *after*, not before.
- Show, don't just tell — every concept gets a copy-pasteable, working example.
- Write the smallest doc that lets the reader succeed; delete or update stale content ruthlessly.
- Update docs in the same commit/PR as the code change that affects them.
- Use plain language, active voice, and consistent terms; define a term once and reuse it.

## Patterns & Examples

```markdown
# OrderService

> Creates and queries customer orders. Use it from the checkout flow.

## Quickstart
    npm install
    npm run dev          # API on http://localhost:3000

## Create an order  (task-oriented)
1. POST `/v1/orders` with a JSON body `{ items: [...] }`.
2. On success you get `201 Created` and the order's `id`.

    curl -X POST localhost:3000/v1/orders \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{"items":[{"sku":"BOOK-01","qty":2}]}'

Returns: `{ "id": 43, "status": "pending", "totalCents": 3998 }`
```

```markdown
# ADR 0007: Use PostgreSQL for the primary store
Date: 2026-06-03 · Status: Accepted

## Context
We need transactional integrity for orders and payments.

## Decision
Adopt PostgreSQL (over MongoDB) for ACID transactions and relational integrity.

## Consequences
+ Strong consistency for money flows.  − Team must manage schema migrations.
```

**The done test:** documentation is finished when a newcomer can follow it to success — install, run,
and complete the primary task — *without asking the author*. If they get stuck, the doc has the bug.

## Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns

- **Stale docs:** instructions that no longer match the code. Worse than no docs — they actively
  mislead. Update them in the same PR.
- **Author-centric writing:** documenting what you find interesting instead of what the reader needs to
  do. Start from the reader's task.
- **Wall of prose:** burying the one command someone needs under paragraphs of background. Lead with
  the answer.
- **Docs detached from code:** a separate wiki that drifts out of sync. Keep docs in the repo.

# React

> A component-based library for building UIs from small, composable pieces of state and view. The dominant way to build interactive web frontends.

## Concepts

- **Component:** a function that takes **props** and returns UI (JSX). The unit of composition.
- **Props:** read-only inputs passed from parent to child. A component never mutates its props.
- **State:** data a component owns and can change over time; changing it re-renders the component.
- **Hooks:** functions that add capabilities to components.
  - `useState` — local state plus its setter.
  - `useEffect` — run a side effect (subscriptions, fetches) after render, with a dependency array
    controlling when it re-runs.
- **Composition:** build complex UIs by nesting small components, passing data down via props and
  `children`.
- **Lifting state up:** when two components need the same data, move it to their nearest common parent
  and pass it down.
- **Keys:** a stable, unique `key` on each item in a list lets React track elements across renders.
- **Controlled inputs:** the form value lives in state; the input reflects state and updates it on
  change.

## Best Practices

- Keep components small and focused; derive values during render instead of mirroring props into state.
- Give every list item a stable `key` (an ID, never the array index for dynamic lists).
- Use `useEffect` only for *synchronizing with external systems* (network, subscriptions, the DOM) —
  not for computing derived data.
- Lift shared state to the closest common parent; reach for context only when prop-passing gets deep.

## Patterns & Examples

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

// A small, self-contained component with controlled input and derived UI.
function SearchableList({ items }) {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');           // owned state

  // Derived during render — no extra state, no effect needed.
  const visible = items.filter((it) =>
    it.name.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())
  );

  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor="q">Filter</label>
      <input
        id="q"
        value={query}                                // controlled: value from state
        onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)}   // update state on change
      />
      <ul>
        {visible.map((it) => (
          <li key={it.id}>{it.name}</li>             {/* stable key */}
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns

- **Effect misuse:** using `useEffect` to compute derived state from props/state. That's just a
  calculation during render — an effect adds an extra render and bugs. Compute it inline.
- **Index as key:** `key={index}` on a reorderable/filterable list confuses React's reconciliation,
  causing wrong items to update. Use a stable ID.
- **Prop drilling:** threading a prop through many intermediate components that don't use it. Lift to
  context or restructure when it gets painful.
- **Mutating state directly:** `state.push(x)` won't re-render; create a new value
  (`setItems([...items, x])`).

# C# Essentials

> A modern, statically-typed, OOP-first language for backend services, desktop, and cross-platform apps on .NET. Pick when you want strong typing, great tooling, and a mature ecosystem.

## Concepts

- **Types:** `class` (reference, mutable identity), `struct` (value, copied), and `record` (concise,
  value-equality types ideal for DTOs/domain values).
- **Properties:** encapsulated state with `{ get; private set; }` or `{ get; init; }` (set once at
  construction) instead of public fields.
- **Interfaces:** name a capability (`IRepository`) that many classes implement — the basis of
  polymorphism and dependency inversion.
- **Generics:** type-safe reuse — `List<T>`, `Repository<T>` — no casting, checked at compile time.
- **async/await:** non-blocking I/O. An `async` method returns a `Task`/`Task<T>`; `await` suspends
  without blocking the thread.
- **LINQ:** declarative queries over any `IEnumerable<T>` (`Where`, `Select`, `OrderBy`).
- **Null-safety:** nullable reference types (`string?`) make "can this be null?" part of the type, so
  the compiler warns before a `NullReferenceException` happens.

## Best Practices

- Enable nullable reference types (`<Nullable>enable</Nullable>`) and treat its warnings as errors.
- Prefer `record` for immutable value/data types; prefer `init` properties over public setters.
- `await` async calls all the way up; never `.Result`/`.Wait()` (deadlocks, blocked threads).
- Depend on interfaces and inject collaborators; use `IEnumerable<T>`/`IReadOnlyList<T>` at boundaries.

## Patterns & Examples

```csharp
// Idiomatic C#: a record value type, an async repository call, LINQ, and null-safety.
public record Customer(Guid Id, string Name, string? Email);   // value-equality DTO

public class CustomerService(ICustomerRepository repo)          // primary constructor (C# 12)
{
    public async Task<IReadOnlyList<string>> ActiveNamesAsync()
    {
        IReadOnlyList<Customer> all = await repo.GetAllAsync();  // non-blocking I/O
        return all
            .Where(c => c.Email is not null)   // null-aware filter
            .OrderBy(c => c.Name)
            .Select(c => c.Name)
            .ToList();
    }
}
```

**Pick when:** enterprise/backend APIs (ASP.NET Core), cross-platform apps (MAUI), game dev (Unity),
or any team that values static typing and first-class tooling.

## Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns

- **Blocking on async (`.Result`, `.Wait()`):** causes deadlocks in some contexts and wastes threads.
  Stay async end-to-end.
- **Ignoring nullable warnings:** disabling them throws away C#'s best defense against null bugs.
- **Public mutable fields:** breaks encapsulation; use properties (and `init`/`private set`).
- **`async void`:** un-awaitable and swallows exceptions; only valid for event handlers.

# HTML & CSS Essentials

> The structure and presentation layer of the web. Semantic HTML gives meaning; modern CSS (Flexbox, Grid) gives layout — get both right and accessibility and responsiveness come mostly for free.

## Concepts

- **Semantic HTML:** use elements for their meaning — `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`,
  `<button>`, `<label>` — not `<div>` for everything. Semantics drive accessibility, SEO, and default
  behavior.
- **The box model:** every element is a box of `content` → `padding` → `border` → `margin`. Set
  `box-sizing: border-box` so `width` includes padding and border (far more predictable).
- **Flexbox:** one-dimensional layout — distribute items along a row *or* column (nav bars, toolbars,
  centering).
- **Grid:** two-dimensional layout — rows *and* columns at once (page layouts, card galleries).
- **Responsive units & media queries:** relative units (`rem`, `%`, `fr`, `vw`) plus `@media`
  breakpoints adapt the layout to the viewport instead of hardcoding pixels.
- **Accessibility basics:** label every input, provide `alt` text, ensure sufficient color contrast,
  and keep a logical focus order.

## Best Practices

- Reach for the right element first; only style a `<div>`/`<span>` when no semantic element fits.
- Use Flexbox for a single axis, Grid for two — don't force one to do the other's job.
- Size with `rem`/`em` and layout with `fr`/`%`; design mobile-first, then add `min-width` media
  queries.
- Always pair an `<input>` with a `<label>` (via `for`/`id`) and give images meaningful `alt`.

## Patterns & Examples

```html
<!-- Semantic structure + an accessible, labeled form control. -->
<main>
  <article class="card">
    <h2>Sign in</h2>
    <form>
      <label for="email">Email</label>
      <input id="email" name="email" type="email" required />
      <button type="submit">Continue</button>
    </form>
  </article>
</main>
```

```css
/* Predictable box model + responsive Grid that reflows with no media query. */
*, *::before, *::after { box-sizing: border-box; }

.gallery {
  display: grid;
  gap: 1rem;
  /* fit as many ~16rem columns as fit; each flexes to fill the row */
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(16rem, 1fr));
}

/* Center a toolbar's items on one axis with Flexbox. */
.toolbar { display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between; }
```

## Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns

- **Divitis:** wrapping everything in nameless `<div>`s instead of semantic elements — invisible to
  assistive tech and harder to style and read.
- **Layout with floats / absolute positioning:** legacy hacks for jobs Flexbox/Grid do cleanly. Floats
  are for wrapping text around images, nothing more.
- **Pixel-locked layouts:** fixed `px` widths that don't reflow; the page breaks on phones.
- **Inaccessible controls:** a styled `<div onclick>` instead of a `<button>` — no keyboard focus, no
  role, no default behavior.

# JavaScript Essentials

> The language of the web (and, via Node.js, the server). Dynamic, flexible, and full of footguns — modern JS gives you the tools to avoid most of them.

## Concepts

- **`let` / `const`:** block-scoped bindings. Default to `const`; use `let` only when you must
  reassign. Never `var` (function-scoped, hoisted — a bug source).
- **Modules (ESM):** `import`/`export` split code into files with explicit dependencies — the standard
  over the legacy CommonJS `require`.
- **Classes & private fields:** `class` with `#field` for true private state (not accessible outside
  the class).
- **Promises & async/await:** asynchronous values. `await` a promise to read its result without
  callbacks; wrap awaited I/O in `try/catch`.
- **Array methods:** `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `find`, `some`/`every` express transformations
  declaratively instead of manual loops.
- **Destructuring & spread:** pull values out (`const { id } = user`) and copy/merge (`{ ...a, ...b }`,
  `[...xs]`) concisely.

## Best Practices

- `const` by default; reach for `let` only on real reassignment.
- Use strict equality `===` always; `==` does surprising type coercion.
- Prefer immutable updates (spread/`map`) over mutating shared arrays and objects.
- Handle promise rejections — `await` inside `try/catch`, or `.catch()` on every chain.

## Patterns & Examples

```javascript
// Modern idiomatic JS: ESM, async/await, destructuring, array methods.
export async function topActiveUsers(api) {
  const users = await api.fetchUsers();           // await async I/O
  return users
    .filter((u) => u.isActive)                     // declarative
    .sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)
    .slice(0, 3)
    .map(({ id, name }) => ({ id, name }));        // destructure + reshape
}

class Counter {
  #count = 0;                 // truly private field
  increment() { this.#count += 1; return this.#count; }
  get value() { return this.#count; }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns

- **`==` coercion:** `0 == ''` and `null == undefined` are `true`; `[] == false` is `true`. Use `===`.
- **`this` confusion:** `this` depends on *how* a function is called, not where it's defined. Use arrow
  functions (which capture the enclosing `this`) for callbacks.
- **Hoisting surprises with `var`:** `var` declarations move to the top and are `undefined` until
  assigned. Use `let`/`const`, which stay in the temporal dead zone until declared.
- **Mutating shared state:** in-place `push`/`sort` on an array passed around causes spooky action at a
  distance. Copy first.
- **Unhandled promise rejection:** a forgotten `await`/`catch` silently swallows errors.

# Cross-Platform Mobile

> Building one codebase that ships to both iOS and Android. A productivity multiplier when your UI and logic are shareable — and a tax when you need deep platform integration.

## Concepts

- **Native vs. cross-platform:** *native* (Swift/SwiftUI on iOS, Kotlin/Jetpack Compose on Android)
  gives the best performance, latest-API access, and platform feel — at the cost of two codebases.
  *Cross-platform* shares one codebase across both, trading some of that for speed of delivery.
- **The main frameworks:**
  - **React Native** — JavaScript/TypeScript + React; renders real native widgets. Best if your team
    already knows React/web.
  - **Flutter** — Dart; draws its own pixels with a fast rendering engine for highly consistent,
    custom UI across platforms.
  - **.NET MAUI** — C#/XAML; native controls on a shared .NET codebase. Best for .NET/C# teams.
- **Shared concerns** every mobile app handles regardless of framework: **navigation** (stack/tab
  flows), **state management**, **offline support** + sync, **push notifications**, and an **embedded
  database** (SQLite is the universal local store).

## Best Practices

- Choose the framework by your team's existing skills and the UI's nature (custom-drawn → Flutter;
  React shop → React Native; .NET shop → MAUI).
- Design for offline first on mobile networks: cache locally (SQLite), queue writes, sync on reconnect.
- Keep platform-specific code behind a thin abstraction so the shared core stays portable.
- Treat push, deep links, and permissions as first-class — they differ per OS and need real testing on
  devices.

## Patterns & Examples

```text
Cross-platform app — typical layered shape:

  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  UI (RN / Flutter / MAUI widgets)         │  ← shared, ~80–95%
  ├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │  State + navigation + domain logic        │  ← shared
  ├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │  Local store (SQLite)  ·  API client      │  ← shared, with sync/offline queue
  ├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │  Native bridges: push, camera, biometrics │  ← thin per-platform layer
  └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**When native wins:** graphics-/compute-heavy apps (games, AR), apps that must adopt new OS APIs on
day one, or features needing deep platform integration (advanced widgets, complex background work).
For most CRUD/business apps, cross-platform ships faster with little downside.

## Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns

- **Assuming "write once, run anywhere":** UI conventions, permissions, and lifecycles differ per OS;
  budget for platform-specific tweaks and on-device testing.
- **Ignoring offline:** a mobile app that white-screens on a flaky network. Cache and queue.
- **Heavy bridge traffic:** chatty calls across the native bridge (React Native) stall the UI thread;
  batch and move heavy work native.
- **Skipping real-device testing:** simulators hide performance, gesture, and notification issues.

# Classes, Objects & Attributes
> The atoms of OOP — what they are, how to model them well, and the traps. Read this before any other OOP module.

## Concepts
- **Class:** a blueprint that defines structure (attributes/fields) and behavior (methods).
- **Object (instance):** a concrete value created from a class, with its own state.
- **Attribute (field/property):** a named piece of state owned by an object. Prefer keeping
  attributes **private** and exposing behavior, not raw data.
- **Method:** behavior that operates on the object's state.
- **Identity vs. state vs. behavior:** two objects can hold equal state yet be distinct identities.

## Best Practices
- Keep attributes private; expose intent through methods (`account.deposit(x)`), not setters that
  let callers break invariants (`account.balance = -100`).
- Initialize objects into a **valid state** via the constructor; reject invalid input early.
- Give one class one responsibility. If you can't name it in a short phrase, it does too much.
- Prefer immutability for value-like objects (money, coordinates).

## Patterns & Examples

```csharp
// C#: an attribute kept consistent by behavior, not exposed as a raw setter.
public class BankAccount
{
    public string Owner { get; }
    public decimal Balance { get; private set; }   // attribute, write-protected

    public BankAccount(string owner, decimal opening)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(owner)) throw new ArgumentException("owner required");
        if (opening < 0) throw new ArgumentException("opening must be >= 0");
        Owner = owner;
        Balance = opening;
    }

    public void Deposit(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount <= 0) throw new ArgumentException("amount must be > 0");
        Balance += amount;              // invariant enforced here
    }
}
```

```javascript
// JavaScript: same idea with a private field (#).
class BankAccount {
  #balance;
  constructor(owner, opening = 0) {
    if (!owner) throw new Error('owner required');
    if (opening < 0) throw new Error('opening must be >= 0');
    this.owner = owner;
    this.#balance = opening;
  }
  get balance() { return this.#balance; }
  deposit(amount) {
    if (amount <= 0) throw new Error('amount must be > 0');
    this.#balance += amount;
  }
}
```

## Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns
- **Anemic objects:** public getters/setters with all logic outside the class — that's a struct, not an object.
- **God object:** one class that knows/does everything.
- **Leaky invariants:** exposing a mutable internal (e.g., returning the internal list) so callers corrupt state.
- **Constructor that can build an invalid object** then "fix it" later.

# Design Patterns
> Named, reusable solutions to recurring design problems. A shared vocabulary — reach for a pattern when you recognize its problem, not to decorate code that doesn't need it.

## Concepts
Design patterns are proven arrangements of classes and objects, traditionally grouped by what they
organize:
- **Creational** — how objects get made (Factory, Builder, Singleton, Abstract Factory, Prototype).
- **Structural** — how objects are composed (Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Composite, Proxy, Bridge).
- **Behavioral** — how objects collaborate and share responsibility (Strategy, Observer, Command,
  Template Method, State, Iterator).

A pattern is a *response to a force* (change, coupling, duplication). If the force isn't present,
the pattern is just extra indirection.

## Best Practices
- Recognize the problem first, then name the pattern — never start from "let's use a pattern."
- Prefer the simplest pattern that resolves the force; a plain function often beats a class hierarchy.
- Patterns are communication: when you do use one, name it (`OrderStrategy`, `PriceObserver`) so the
  next reader sees the intent.

## Patterns & Examples

### Factory (Creational)
**Intent:** centralize object creation behind a method so callers don't depend on concrete types.
**When to use:** the concrete type depends on input/config, or construction is non-trivial and
repeated.

```javascript
// One place decides which concrete logger to build.
function createLogger(env) {
  switch (env) {
    case 'prod': return new JsonLogger();
    case 'test': return new NullLogger();
    default:     return new ConsoleLogger();
  }
}
const log = createLogger(process.env.NODE_ENV); // caller stays decoupled from concretes
```

*Over-use warning:* a factory that only ever returns `new Thing()` adds indirection with no payoff —
just call the constructor.

### Strategy (Behavioral)
**Intent:** capture interchangeable algorithms behind a common interface; swap them at runtime.
**When to use:** you have a family of variants (pricing rules, sort orders, compression) selected by
context.

```csharp
interface IShippingCost { decimal For(Order o); }
class Standard : IShippingCost { public decimal For(Order o) => 5m; }
class Express  : IShippingCost { public decimal For(Order o) => 15m; }

class Checkout
{
    private readonly IShippingCost _cost;
    public Checkout(IShippingCost cost) => _cost = cost;   // strategy injected
    public decimal Total(Order o) => o.Subtotal + _cost.For(o);
}
```

*Over-use warning:* if there's exactly one algorithm and no real prospect of another, a plain method
is clearer than a strategy hierarchy.

### Observer (Behavioral)
**Intent:** let many subscribers react to a subject's changes without the subject knowing them.
**When to use:** one-to-many event notification — UI updates, domain events, pub/sub.

```javascript
class Subject {
  #observers = new Set();
  subscribe(fn) { this.#observers.add(fn); return () => this.#observers.delete(fn); }
  notify(event) { for (const fn of this.#observers) fn(event); }
}
const stock = new Subject();
const unsubscribe = stock.subscribe((e) => console.log('price:', e.price));
stock.notify({ price: 42 }); // every subscriber reacts
```

*Over-use warning:* deep chains of observers triggering observers make control flow impossible to
trace. For complex flows, prefer an explicit event bus with logging.

### Adapter (Structural)
**Intent:** wrap an incompatible interface so it fits the one your code expects.
**When to use:** integrating a third-party/legacy API without leaking its shape across your codebase.

```javascript
// Your code expects pay(amountCents). The vendor SDK speaks a different dialect.
class StripeAdapter {
  constructor(stripe) { this.stripe = stripe; }
  pay(amountCents) {
    return this.stripe.charges.create({ amount: amountCents, currency: 'usd' });
  }
}
const gateway = new StripeAdapter(stripeSdk); // rest of app depends on pay(), not Stripe
```

*Over-use warning:* don't adapt an interface you fully control — just change it. Adapters are for
boundaries you can't edit.

### Repository (Structural / DDD)
**Intent:** present persistence as an in-memory collection of domain objects, hiding the data store.
**When to use:** you want domain logic free of SQL/ORM detail and tests free of a real database.

```csharp
interface IUserRepository
{
    User? GetById(Guid id);
    void Add(User user);
}
// SqlUserRepository implements it with EF/Dapper; InMemoryUserRepository implements it for tests.
class UserService
{
    private readonly IUserRepository _users;
    public UserService(IUserRepository users) => _users = users;
}
```

*Over-use warning:* a repository that's a thin pass-through over an ORM that already gives you this
abstraction is duplication. Add it when domain logic or testability actually benefits.

### Dependency Injection (Behavioral / structural enabler)
**Intent:** supply a class's collaborators from outside instead of constructing them inside.
**When to use:** almost always for cross-cutting collaborators (repositories, clients, clocks) — it's
the practical form of the Dependency Inversion principle.

```csharp
class ReportService
{
    private readonly IClock _clock;
    private readonly IUserRepository _users;
    // Collaborators are injected -> easy to swap a fake clock/repo in tests.
    public ReportService(IClock clock, IUserRepository users)
    {
        _clock = clock;
        _users = users;
    }
}
```

*Over-use warning:* injecting trivial, stateless helpers (or wiring a full DI container into a tiny
script) adds ceremony. Inject what varies or needs faking; just `new` the rest.

## Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns
- **Pattern-driven design:** forcing a pattern onto a problem that doesn't have its force, producing
  indirection nobody needs.
- **Golden-hammer Singleton:** global mutable state dressed as a pattern — hard to test, hides
  dependencies. Prefer DI with a single registered instance.
- **Naming without applying:** calling a class `XManager`/`XFactory` while it does none of the
  pattern's job, misleading readers.
- **Pattern soup:** five patterns where a function and a list would do.

# The Four Pillars of OOP
> Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism — the ideas every other OOP technique is built on. Reach for this when deciding how objects should relate.

## Concepts
- **Encapsulation:** hide internal state behind behavior. The object owns its data and guards its
  invariants; callers ask it to *do* things, they don't reach in and mutate fields. This is what
  makes change safe — you can rework the internals without breaking callers.
- **Abstraction:** model the essential, hide the rest. An interface or abstract type names *what*
  an object does, not *how*. Callers depend on the concept (`PaymentGateway`), not the mechanism
  (`StripeHttpClient`).
- **Inheritance (is-a):** a subtype specializes a base type and inherits its contract. Use it only
  when the subtype genuinely *is* a kind of the base and can stand in for it everywhere (see LSP in
  `solid.md`). It is the tightest coupling in OOP — handle with care.
- **Polymorphism:** one interface, many implementations. *Subtype* polymorphism lets a caller treat
  different concrete types uniformly through a shared abstraction; *parametric* polymorphism
  (generics) lets one piece of code work over many types safely. Program to the abstraction and the
  right behavior is selected at runtime.

## Best Practices
- Encapsulate first: make fields private, expose intent-revealing methods, return copies of mutable
  internals.
- Depend on abstractions (interfaces/abstract classes), not concrete types, at module boundaries.
- **Favor composition over inheritance.** Reach for inheritance only for true is-a relationships
  with a stable base contract; reach for composition (has-a) to share behavior.
- Keep inheritance shallow. Every level multiplies the assumptions a subtype must honor.

## Patterns & Examples

Polymorphism — the same call site drives different behavior per concrete type.

```csharp
// C#: subtype polymorphism through an abstract base.
public abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract double Area();
}

public sealed class Circle : Shape
{
    private readonly double _r;
    public Circle(double r) => _r = r;
    public override double Area() => Math.PI * _r * _r;
}

public sealed class Square : Shape
{
    private readonly double _side;
    public Square(double side) => _side = side;
    public override double Area() => _side * _side;
}

// Caller never branches on type — it just asks each Shape for its Area().
double TotalArea(IEnumerable<Shape> shapes) => shapes.Sum(s => s.Area());
```

```javascript
// JavaScript: same polymorphism via a shared method contract (duck typing).
class Circle {
  constructor(r) { this.r = r; }
  area() { return Math.PI * this.r ** 2; }
}

class Square {
  constructor(side) { this.side = side; }
  area() { return this.side ** 2; }
}

// Works for anything that responds to area() — no shared base class required.
const totalArea = (shapes) => shapes.reduce((sum, s) => sum + s.area(), 0);
```

## Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns
- **Deep inheritance trees:** four levels deep, a change to the base silently breaks a leaf you
  forgot existed. Depth makes behavior hard to trace and brittle to change.
- **Inheritance for code reuse:** subclassing just to grab a few methods couples you to the base's
  entire contract and lifecycle. If the relationship isn't honestly *is-a*, use composition — hold
  the helper as a field and delegate to it.
- **Leaky abstraction:** an interface that exposes implementation details (a `getSqlConnection()` on
  a "repository") forces callers to know the mechanism, defeating the point.
- **Type-checking instead of polymorphism:** `if (shape instanceof Circle) ...` re-implements the
  dispatch the language would do for you. Push the behavior onto the type.

# SOLID Principles
> Five design principles that keep object-oriented code changeable. Use them to diagnose *why* a class is painful to modify, then refactor toward the fix.

## Concepts
SOLID is five heuristics for organizing responsibilities and dependencies so that change stays
cheap: **S**ingle Responsibility, **O**pen/Closed, **L**iskov Substitution, **I**nterface
Segregation, **D**ependency Inversion. Each one names a specific kind of rigidity and points at the
refactor that removes it.

## Best Practices
- Apply a principle when you feel its smell, not pre-emptively. SOLID is a response to pain, not a
  setup tax.
- Refactor toward SOLID in small, test-backed steps — each principle has a mechanical fix.
- Prefer the smallest interface, the narrowest responsibility, and the most abstract dependency that
  still does the job.

## Patterns & Examples

### S — Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have one reason to change.

*Violation smell:* an `Invoice` class that calculates totals **and** renders HTML **and** emails the
customer. A change to the email template forces you to edit (and retest) tax logic.

```csharp
// Fix: split the reasons to change into collaborators.
class Invoice          { public decimal Total() { /* tax/totals only */ return 0m; } }
class InvoiceRenderer  { public string ToHtml(Invoice i) { /* presentation only */ return ""; } }
class InvoiceMailer    { public void Send(Invoice i, string html) { /* delivery only */ } }
```

### O — Open/Closed Principle
Open for extension, closed for modification.

*Violation smell:* a `switch (shape.Type)` you must reopen and edit every time a new shape is added.

```csharp
// Fix: extend by adding a type, not by editing existing code.
abstract class Shape { public abstract double Area(); }
class Circle : Shape { double r; public override double Area() => Math.PI * r * r; }
class Square : Shape { double s; public override double Area() => s * s; }
// Adding a Triangle never touches Circle, Square, or the caller.
```

### L — Liskov Substitution Principle
Subtypes must be usable anywhere their base type is expected, without surprises.

*Violation smell:* `Square : Rectangle` where setting width also mutates height — code written
against `Rectangle` now computes the wrong area. An override that throws `NotSupportedException` is
the same smell.

```csharp
// Fix: don't force an is-a that breaks the contract. Model the shared concept instead.
interface IShape { double Area(); }
class Rectangle : IShape { double w, h; public double Area() => w * h; }
class Square    : IShape { double s;    public double Area() => s * s; }
```

### I — Interface Segregation Principle
Many small, focused interfaces beat one fat one.

*Violation smell:* an `IMachine { Print(); Scan(); Fax(); }` that a simple printer must implement,
stubbing `Scan` and `Fax` with `throw`.

```csharp
// Fix: split so implementers depend only on what they use.
interface IPrinter { void Print(); }
interface IScanner { void Scan(); }
class SimplePrinter : IPrinter { public void Print() { /* ... */ } }
```

### D — Dependency Inversion Principle
Depend on abstractions, not concretions; high-level policy shouldn't import low-level detail.

*Violation smell:* an `OrderService` that does `new SqlOrderRepository()` inside its constructor —
you can't test it without a database, can't swap storage without editing it.

```csharp
// Fix: depend on an interface; inject the concrete implementation.
interface IOrderRepository { void Save(Order o); }
class OrderService
{
    private readonly IOrderRepository _repo;
    public OrderService(IOrderRepository repo) => _repo = repo;  // injected, not newed
}
```

## Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns
- **Over-segregation:** one method per interface and a constructor with ten dependencies. The fix
  became the new rigidity.
- **Premature OCP:** abstracting for extension points nobody needs yet (violates YAGNI). Add the
  seam when the second case actually arrives.
- **Cargo-cult SRP:** splitting a cohesive class into anemic data-and-helper pairs that always change
  together — that's one responsibility wearing two files.
- **Worshipping the acronym:** treating "is this SOLID?" as the goal instead of "is this easy to
  change?"

# Security Best Practices

> Secure-by-default engineering: assume input is hostile, grant the least access that works, and never store secrets in code. Security is a property of every layer, not a feature you bolt on.

## Concepts

- **OWASP Top 10 (at a glance):** the most common, highest-impact web risks — broken access control,
  injection (SQL/command/XSS), cryptographic failures, insecure design, security misconfiguration,
  vulnerable/outdated components, identification/authentication failures, software/data integrity
  failures, logging/monitoring failures, and server-side request forgery (SSRF). Know them; design
  against them.
- **Input validation & output encoding:** validate/normalize all input at the boundary against an
  allow-list; *encode* output for its context (HTML, SQL, shell) to neutralize injection. Validation
  stops bad data in; encoding stops bad data from being interpreted on the way out.
- **Auth & session hygiene:** hash passwords with a slow, salted algorithm (bcrypt/argon2 — never
  plain MD5/SHA), use short-lived tokens, set `HttpOnly`/`Secure`/`SameSite` cookies, and enforce
  HTTPS everywhere.
- **Secrets management:** keep credentials in a secret store / environment, never in source control;
  rotate them; scope them tightly.
- **Dependency / CVE hygiene:** third-party code is your attack surface. Pin versions, audit
  regularly, and patch known vulnerabilities promptly.
- **Least privilege:** every user, service, token, and DB account gets the minimum access it needs —
  nothing more.

## Best Practices

- Validate input with allow-lists; reject by default. Parameterize every query and command.
- Encode output for its sink (HTML-encode to stop XSS, parameterize to stop SQLi).
- Store only password *hashes* (argon2/bcrypt); never log secrets or PII.
- Run dependency audits in CI and keep components current.
- Default every grant to the narrowest scope and expand only with cause.

## Patterns & Examples

```javascript
// Defense in depth on a login route: parameterized query + constant-time hash check.
import argon2 from 'argon2';

async function login(db, email, password) {
  // Parameterized — user input never concatenated into SQL (stops injection).
  const user = await db.query('SELECT id, password_hash FROM users WHERE email = $1', [email]);
  if (!user) return null;

  // argon2.verify is slow + salted; resists brute force and timing attacks.
  const ok = await argon2.verify(user.password_hash, password);
  return ok ? { id: user.id } : null;   // never reveal which field was wrong
}
```

```text
Secrets: read from the environment / a secret manager — never hardcode.
  ✗  const apiKey = "sk_live_9f1c…";              // committed → compromised forever
  ✓  const apiKey = process.env.STRIPE_API_KEY;   // injected at deploy, rotatable
```

This module is the practical complement to the agent's **`core/05-guardrails.md`** mindset: validate
input, parameterize queries, hash secrets, least privilege, no secrets in code, and flag insecure
requests instead of silently complying.

## Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns

- **Trusting client input:** validating only in the browser; the API is called directly. Validate on
  the server, always.
- **String-built queries/commands:** the root of SQL injection and command injection. Parameterize.
- **Rolling your own crypto / storing plaintext passwords:** use vetted libraries and slow hashes.
- **Secrets in Git:** even deleted-then-committed keys live in history. Rotate and use a vault.
- **Over-privileged accounts:** one leaked admin token = full compromise. Scope everything.

# Automated Testing

> Tests that run on every change, fast and unattended, so you can refactor without fear. The safety net that lets a codebase keep moving.

## Concepts

- **The test pyramid:** many fast **unit** tests at the base, fewer **integration** tests in the
  middle, a thin layer of slow **end-to-end (e2e)** tests on top. Push verification down the pyramid
  — cheaper, faster, more precise feedback.
- **Unit test:** exercises one unit (a class/function) in isolation. Fast, deterministic, no I/O.
- **Integration test:** verifies that units work together across a real boundary (DB, HTTP, queue).
- **End-to-end test:** drives the whole system as a user would (browser, API surface). High
  confidence, high cost — keep them few.
- **Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA):** the shape of a good test — set up inputs, perform the one action,
  assert the one outcome.
- **TDD loop (red-green-refactor):** write a failing test (red), write the minimum code to pass it
  (green), then clean up with the test as a guard (refactor).

## Best Practices

- One behavior per test; name it after the behavior (`Deposit_RejectsNegativeAmount`).
- Keep unit tests **fast and deterministic** — no clock, network, or random unless injected/seeded.
- Mock sparingly — only true external boundaries (network, clock, filesystem). Over-mocking tests the
  mocks, not the code.
- Treat **coverage as a signal, not a goal.** 100% coverage of trivial getters proves nothing; cover
  the branches that carry risk.
- Make the test suite a precondition for merge (CI), not an afterthought.

## Patterns & Examples

```csharp
// C# with xUnit — Arrange-Act-Assert, one behavior per test.
public class BankAccountTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void Deposit_IncreasesBalance()
    {
        var account = new BankAccount("Ada", 100m);   // Arrange
        account.Deposit(50m);                          // Act
        Assert.Equal(150m, account.Balance);           // Assert
    }

    [Fact]
    public void Deposit_RejectsNonPositiveAmount()
    {
        var account = new BankAccount("Ada", 100m);
        Assert.Throws<ArgumentException>(() => account.Deposit(0m));
    }
}
```

```javascript
// JavaScript with the built-in node:test runner — zero dependencies.
import { test } from 'node:test';
import assert from 'node:assert/strict';
import { BankAccount } from './bank-account.js';

test('deposit increases the balance', () => {
  const account = new BankAccount('Ada', 100);   // Arrange
  account.deposit(50);                            // Act
  assert.equal(account.balance, 150);             // Assert
});

test('deposit rejects a non-positive amount', () => {
  const account = new BankAccount('Ada', 100);
  assert.throws(() => account.deposit(0), /amount must be > 0/);
});
```

## Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns

- **Ice-cream cone:** the pyramid inverted — lots of slow, flaky e2e tests and almost no unit tests.
  Slow feedback, hard to debug failures.
- **Testing implementation, not behavior:** asserting that a private method was called rather than
  that the outcome is correct; the tests break on every refactor.
- **Flaky tests:** dependence on timing, ordering, or shared state. A test that fails randomly trains
  the team to ignore red — quarantine and fix it.
- **Coverage worship:** writing assertion-free tests to hit a percentage. Cover behavior and risk.

# Manual QA

> Human testing for the things automation can't judge — usability, exploratory edge cases, and "does this actually feel right." A complement to automated tests, never a replacement.

## Concepts

- **When manual QA matters:** judging visual/UX quality, exploring undocumented edge cases,
  one-off release sign-off, and verifying behavior that's expensive or not-yet-worth automating.
- **Exploratory testing:** simultaneously learning the system, designing tests, and running them —
  following hunches a scripted test wouldn't. Time-boxed and charter-driven, not random clicking.
- **Test case:** a documented scenario — preconditions, steps, expected result — so anyone can
  reproduce a check the same way.
- **Bug report:** the artifact that gets a defect fixed. Must contain clear **repro steps**,
  **expected vs. actual**, environment, and a **severity** (how bad) distinct from priority (how soon).
- **Regression checklist:** the set of critical flows you re-verify before every release to catch
  things a change may have broken elsewhere.

## Best Practices

- Write bug reports a developer can act on without asking questions: minimal steps, exact inputs,
  expected vs. actual, screenshots/logs, build/version, platform.
- Separate **severity** (impact) from **priority** (urgency) — a cosmetic bug on the login page can be
  low severity but high priority.
- Keep a living regression checklist of business-critical paths; run a smoke pass every release.
- Cover **accessibility** (keyboard nav, labels, contrast) and a **cross-browser/device** smoke as
  part of QA, not a separate afterthought.
- Automate what's repetitive and stable; reserve human time for judgment and exploration.

## Patterns & Examples

```text
BUG REPORT — Checkout total ignores discount code
-------------------------------------------------
Severity:    High        Priority: P1
Environment: Web · Chrome 124 · build 2026.6.1 · staging

Steps to reproduce:
  1. Add any item to the cart.
  2. Enter discount code SAVE10 and click "Apply".
  3. Proceed to the order summary.

Expected: Order total is reduced by 10%.
Actual:   "SAVE10 applied" shows, but the total is unchanged.

Evidence: screenshot attached; network tab shows discount=0 in /checkout response.
```

```text
RELEASE REGRESSION CHECKLIST (smoke)
  [ ] Sign up / log in / log out
  [ ] Core happy path (e.g., add to cart → pay → receipt)
  [ ] Search returns expected results
  [ ] Forms validate and show errors
  [ ] Keyboard-only nav reaches all controls (a11y)
  [ ] Renders on Chrome, Firefox, Safari + one mobile width
```

## Common Pitfalls / Anti-patterns

- **Manually testing what should be automated:** re-clicking a stable, deterministic flow every
  release wastes human time and is less reliable than a script. Automate it; explore elsewhere.
- **Vague bug reports:** "it's broken" / "doesn't work" with no steps — un-actionable, bounces back
  and forth, delays the fix.
- **No environment/version:** a bug that "can't be reproduced" because the report omitted the build,
  browser, or data state.
- **QA as a gate at the very end:** treating quality as a final phase instead of testing continuously
  guarantees a crunch and missed defects.
