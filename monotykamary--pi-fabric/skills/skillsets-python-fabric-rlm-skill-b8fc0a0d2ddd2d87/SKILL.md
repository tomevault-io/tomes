# Fabric Recursive Decomposition — Python

Use recursion for context size, not mere difficulty. Pass only the objective as `payloads.task`. Orient → delegate non-overlapping context-sized partitions → combine in one Python `fabric_exec`. Python calls `agents.run(runner="pi", recursive=True, ...)` directly for oversized partitions, not guest callback helpers. Plain leaves explicitly use `recursive=False`.

## Context is an external variable

Keep source handles, partitions, and intermediate findings guest-local for this invocation. Children inspect paths or receive bounded slices, never the whole corpus. Guest bindings end with each call. For continuation across turns, persist JSON under root-scoped `rlm/<rootId>/bindings/...` mesh keys; send keys rather than values. For values above the mesh event limit use project-relative files plus digests. Mesh data is project-visible with no automatic TTL: no secrets; clean it up after completion. `state` is for claims and evidence, not scratch data.

```

Reserve agent capacity for orientation and synthesis. At most two top-level partitions recurse, batches are four, and an all-failed batch stops new spend. The host depth ceiling bounds descendants; `agents.maxDepth=0` disables spawning. Settled usage is observational under concurrency, not a reservation. Initial recursive approval delegates only agent risk, not network/execute/write. Partition edit ownership or use `worktree=True`. Redirect valuable running children rather than discarding their context.

Only compact findings return on fallback, never full FabricAgentResult objects. Preserve paths for targeted retries. `partial` is useful evidence with named gaps; never automatically rerun successful partitions or the whole tree.
