description: Multi-model deliberation. Two to 8 distinct models answer in parallel with web-capable tools, then a judge compares consensus, contradictions, coverage gaps, unique insights, and blind spots. Act mode runs 1–4 read-only references, then one actor reconciles and executes. Use when the cost of being wrong justifies multiple completions. Use when this capability is needed.

# Fabric Fusion — Python

Use one Python `fabric_exec` for model diversity when the cost of being wrong justifies it. Compare mode runs a 2–8 model panel and a judge only when at least two complete; act mode runs 1–4 read-only references then exactly one actor. The judge compares, never merges. Tactical work should use a plain agent.

Supply every top-level payload key: `task`, JSON `panel` (objects with model and optional label), `mode` (`compare`, `act`, or empty), `thinking`, `judge`, JSON `tools`, `actor`, JSON `actorTools`. Use empty strings for unset optional choices. Compare tools default to read/grep/find/ls/bash; act references always use read/grep/find/ls, while the explicit actor defaults to those plus bash/edit/write. Discover canonical model keys first; aliases must not duplicate resolved identities.

```

Reserve panel count plus one agent call; concurrency and settled usage are host-limited, not hard token reservations. Plain non-recursive agents keep deliberation one level. Claude is optional and uses canonical `claude/` keys; never pass a concrete Fabric kernel to a native Claude child. Pi children inherit Python.

Successful comparison returns only compact structured analysis. Successful acting keeps reference advice private. Zero completed references mean no actor spend; partial reference coverage still permits one actor. Failed aggregation returns completed work as fallback. Never automatically rerun successful references or the full panel; retry only missing coverage or aggregation. For same-model role diversity recommend `/skill:fabric-council` for the user; do not invoke another user-only skill yourself.
