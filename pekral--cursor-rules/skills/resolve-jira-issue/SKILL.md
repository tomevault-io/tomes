**Constraint:**
- Apply @rules/base-constraints.mdc
- Apply @rules/github-operations.mdc
- Apply @rules/jira-operations.mdc
- Before resolving a task, always switch to the main branch, download the latest changes, and make sure you have the latest code in the main branch.
- If you are not on the main git branch in the project, switch to it.
- Analyze all comments in the issue and create a list of tasks from the assignment and comments so that you can resolve all issues, if they have not already been resolved.
- Pull request creation is mandatory for every resolved JIRA issue. After the code review cycle is clean (no Critical, Moderate, or Minor findings), automatically push the branch and create a GitHub PR, then link it back to the JIRA issue. Do not finish without a PR URL.
- **Safe error messages:** All user-facing error and validation messages must be written so they do not reveal internal implementation details, database structure, file paths, or technology specifics that could help an attacker deduce an exploit vector. Messages should be helpful for the user but not informative for an attacker.

**Universal JIRA Comment Formatting**
- Use this structure for every JIRA comment type (status update, testing recommendation, CR summary, implementation summary):
- Title: `h3. <short title>`
- Short context paragraph (1-3 lines, plain text)
- Optional sections with `h4. <section title>`
- Bullets with `* item`
- For testing recommendations, include direct in-app links as full URLs in each bullet item
- Inline code/paths/endpoints in monospace using `{{...}}`
- Code examples only via `{code[:language]}` blocks
- Tables only with JIRA table syntax (`||` header row, `|` data row)
- Keep one empty line between blocks for readability

Example of the final JIRA comment body:
```text
h3. Implementation summary

Feature is ready for review. Main behavior was validated locally.

h4. What changed
* Added validation for {{subscriber_data}} payload.
* Added guard for {{allow_resubscribe}} transition from {{2 -> 1}}.

h4. API example
{code:json}
{
  "allow_resubscribe": true,
  "subscriber_data": [
    {"email": "user@example.com", "status": 1}
  ]
}
{code}

h4. Testing recommendations
* Verify update for an existing contact.
* Verify skipped unknown contact appears in response {{errors}}.
* Verify rate-limit handling (HTTP {{429}} with {{Retry-After}}).
```

**Steps:**
- Analyze all comments in the issue and create a list of tasks from the assignment and comments so that you can resolve all issues, if they have not already been resolved.
- I want you to fix the bug from JIRA (you have either the ID or a link to JIRA).
  Use the preferred JIRA tool (see @rules/jira-operations.mdc) to retrieve all issue details (including comments and attachments).
  If you have other resources available that you could use to understand the problem, load them and analyze them.
- Classify the task type before writing any code:
  - **Bug**: the issue describes existing functionality that behaves incorrectly (e.g. wrong output, exception, regression, data corruption). Issue types such as `Bug` or `Defect`, or labels such as `bug`, `fix`, or `regression` are strong signals.
  - **Feature**: the issue requests new behaviour that does not exist yet.
  - If the classification is unclear, treat the task as a feature.
- If the task is a **bug**, follow strict TDD:
  1. Write a test that reproduces the reported failure (the test must fail before any fix is applied).
  2. Run the test and confirm it fails — do not proceed until you see the red failure.
  3. Implement the minimal fix that makes the test pass.
  4. Run the test again and confirm it is green.
- If the task is a **feature**, implement it directly without the failing-test-first requirement.
- Resolve this issue (the generated code must be according to @skills/class-refactoring/SKILL.md), then review the code according to @skills/code-review/SKILL.md and @skills/security-review/SKILL.md for current changes. If you find any critical issues in the new changes, resolve them and perform further iterations of the defined code review (repeat until the bug is fixed).
- For Action-pattern refactors during issue resolution: if an Action calls a Service or Facade method that is used only once in the entire codebase, move the business logic from that Service/Facade method directly into the Action and remove the original Service/Facade method.
- Find the attachments for the assignment and analyze them. Again, use the available MCP servers or CLI tools for the specific issue tracker.
- For all changes in the current branch, analyze code coverage and ensure that all changes are covered by tests. Add any missing tests to ensure 100% coverage.
- Apply @rules/testing-conventions.mdc
- If there are any automatic fixers in the project that are called through another layer, such as Phing or composer scripts, run them and ensure automatic error correction (find and load local configs for tools if exists). If there are any CI (or local) checkers, run them (never run all tests for the entire codebase, only for the current changes). Fix any errors, run the fixers again, and keep fixing until all errors are fixed. Never try to format PHP code outside of these fixers yourself.
- Before creating a PR, run @skills/code-review-jira/SKILL.md for the current changes and treat it as mandatory CR for JIRA flow.
- Fix all Critical, Moderate, and Minor findings from that CR directly in code/tests, then run @skills/code-review-jira/SKILL.md again.
- Repeat the CR + fix cycle until there are no Critical, Moderate, or Minor findings left.
- Only after the CR cycle is clean, automatically push the branch and create a GitHub pull request according to the pr.mdc rules. This step is mandatory; do not wait for additional confirmation.
- If there is no link to the issue tracker, add a link to the issue tracker entry to the CR summary and, if possible, link it directly according to the issue tracker recommendations. Be sure to include an HTTP link.
- I want you to post a comment on the core revision on GitHub, but I want you to post only critical or medium-severity issues, ideally including the lines of code that are affected. If there are none, don't post anything! If possible, mark the issue as ready for review.
- After completing all tasks for GitHub, link the created PR in the JIRA issue, change the status of the JIRA issue to ready for review.
- Run the tests and let me know if the current changes meet the requirements. If so, add a new comment to the issue with brief testing recommendations and include direct in-app links (full URLs) for each recommendation so testers can click through immediately. If the requirements are not met or you have found critical errors, just list them for me.
- Write missing tests for current changes and ensure 100% coverage, fix dry and try to simplify the code base so that it is easy to read for humans, but also as simple as possible. These changes will be in a separate commit.
- I want you to post a comment into the pull request on GitHub regarding the core review, but I want you to only post critical or moderately serious issues, ideally including the lines of code that are affected. If there are none, don't post anything! If possible, mark the issue with the label ready for review.
- After creating the PR, run one final validation pass with @skills/code-review-jira/SKILL.md to confirm no new Critical or Moderate findings were introduced.

- **After completing the tasks**
- Once you have finished your work and pushed the changes to pr, perform a code review according to your skill level @skills/code-review-jira/SKILL.md
- If according to @skills/test-like-human/SKILL.md the changes can be tested, do it!
- If the work is done, run @skills/code-review-jira/SKILL.md for the current issue.
