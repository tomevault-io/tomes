description: Search the brig code-graph index first and report exact path:line findings with scan counts Use when this capability is needed.

Use this when you need to locate code before reading or editing. Investigate
through the index, never by guessing spans or reading whole files.

## Allowed tools

- The brig index tools: `search_symbols`, `get_symbol`, `get_outline`,
  `callers_callees`, `blast_radius`, `check_refs`.
- Read-only inspection of tool output (byte-exact spans, `_meta` envelope).

## Forbidden

- No file writes, edits, creates, or deletes. No shell mutations.
- No claims about code not returned by the index.
- No whole-file reads to "double-check" — the index span is authoritative.

## Procedure

1. Run `search_symbols` for the identifier or concept.
2. Run `get_symbol` / `get_outline` to pin exact location and signature.
3. Run `callers_callees` (depth <= 3) or `blast_radius` only if the brief asks
   about impact or usage. Run `check_refs` to confirm a reference before
   anyone deletes it.
4. Report what the index returned, nothing more.

## Output format (required)

One finding per line:

```text
path:line — symbol — ≤6 words
```

Rules:

- `path:line` uses the byte-offset-derived line from the index.
- `symbol` is the qualified name from the index.
- The trailing note is six words or fewer.
- If the index returns nothing, output exactly (and nothing else):

```text
No match.
```

- If claiming absence, cite `_meta` scan counts, e.g.
  `No match. (scanned N files, M symbols)`.
- Never output an empty report: either findings or `No match.`.

## Handoff

Findings feed the plan file. They are not an implementation order — the
builder executes only the plan.
