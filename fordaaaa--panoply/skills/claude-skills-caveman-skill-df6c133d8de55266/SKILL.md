description: Rewrite internal output (subagent reports, background status, scratch artifacts) into a compressed, telegraphic register that cuts token usage. Never applies to the end user's final message. Use when this capability is needed.

Compress the text you are about to write. This applies only to internal/subagent-directed output — see **Scope** below.

## Compression rules

- Drop articles (`a`, `an`, `the`), hedging (`I think`, `it seems`, `probably`), and filler transitions (`in order to`, `it's worth noting that`).
- Use `→` for causality/sequence instead of a full clause (`token unset → server exits 1`, not `if the token is unset, the server will exit with code 1`).
- Keep verbatim: nouns, verbs, numbers, names, identifiers, file paths, code, error messages, technical terms. Never compress a code block, a file path, a command, or a quoted string — compression is for prose scaffolding around facts, not the facts themselves.
- Prefer dense noun/verb/number phrasing over full sentences. Fragments are fine.
- Never sacrifice a fact, a caveat, or a number to save words. If compressing would drop information the reader needs, don't compress that part.

## Self-check (required)

End any block you compressed with one line:

```
[caveman: ~N% token reduction est.]
```

Estimate `N` by comparing the word count of what you wrote against a rough uncompressed equivalent of the same content. This is the artifact that makes the skill checkable rather than a vibe — if you can't honestly estimate a reduction, you probably didn't compress anything, and the line should say `~0%`.

## Scope — read before applying

Scope is controlled by `.claude/settings.json`'s `caveman.scope` field (or the `PANOPLY_CAVEMAN_SCOPE` env var, which wins) — see `.claude/hooks/caveman-nudge.mjs`.

- **`everywhere`** (current default): compress everything — subagent prompts/reports, scratch/status artifacts, and the assistant's own top-level chat message.
- **`subagent`**: compress only the prompt sent into a `Task`/subagent call, a subagent's returned report before it's summarized for the user, and scratch/status artifacts not meant for direct human reading. Never the top-level chat message.

Check which mode is active before assuming either way — don't hardcode an assumption here.
