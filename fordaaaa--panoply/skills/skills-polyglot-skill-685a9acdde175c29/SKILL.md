description: Detect the stack in the touched files and run the right build, test, and lint commands for Python, Go, Rust, Node, Java, or Docker Use when this capability is needed.

Use this when a command needs to verify code and the repo's stack is unknown or mixed. Detect from the files and manifests actually present — never assume a runner, a package manager, or a test suite exists.

## Detection — manifests beat vibes

Check the touched area for these signals, in order. Several may match at once — that means polyglot, and each area reports its own stack.

- Python: `pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg`, `requirements*.txt`, `uv.lock`, `.venv`
- Go: `go.mod`
- Rust: `Cargo.toml`
- Node/TypeScript: `package.json` (read `packageManager` + `scripts`; never assume `npm`)
- Java: `pom.xml`, `build.gradle*`
- Docker: `Dockerfile`, `compose*.yml`, `docker-compose*.yml` (note presence only — never build or start images unasked)

## Commands matrix

Prefer the repo's declared script over the raw tool (e.g. `scripts.test` before bare `pytest`). Probe cheaply (`--version` / `--help`) before running anything long.

| Stack | Test | Lint / typecheck | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Python | `pytest -q` (or `uv run pytest -q`) | `ruff check .`, `mypy` only if configured | Activate `.venv` if present; never install packages unasked |
| Go | `go test ./...` | `gofmt -l .`, `go vet ./...` | No venv; module-aware via `go.mod` |
| Rust | `cargo test --quiet` | `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt --check` | First build may be slow — say so before running |
| Node/TS | `npm test -- --runInBand` (or pnpm/yarn per `packageManager`) | `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck` if declared | Never run `npm install` unasked; respect lockfile |
| Java | `mvn -q test` or `./gradlew test` | `mvn -q checkstyle:check` only if configured | Wrapper script (`mvnw`/`gradlew`) wins over system binary |
| Docker | n/a | `docker compose config --quiet` to validate only | Validate, never `up` — starting services is a separate decision |

## Rules

- Read-only first: manifests and scripts before any execution.
- Cheapest probe first: `--version` before the suite, one package before `./...`.
- If no runner exists for a stack, report `no-framework` loudly. An unverifiable claim is not a satisfied one.
- Never touch `.github/workflows/`, CI config, lockfiles, or secrets to make a check pass.

## Report-back format (required)

End any verification block with one line per command run:

```
[polyglot: <stack> `<cmd>` → exit <n> · <summary line or "none found">]
```

If no command was run, the line reads `[polyglot: <stack> no command — <why>]`. This is the artifact that makes the skill checkable: a reader can point at the line and say whether the check ran.
