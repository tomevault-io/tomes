description: Verify the diff against the plan line by line and return a verdict with evidence Use when this capability is needed.

Use this when a diff claims to implement a plan. Check the diff against the
plan — never edit source, plans, or the diff. Report, don't fix.

## Input

- The plan file the diff claims to implement.
- The diff under review (`git diff` / `git diff --cached`).

## Procedure

1. Read the plan file. Note its goal, files in scope, and definition of done.
2. Read the full diff. For each hunk, find the plan line that authorizes it.
3. Flag any hunk with no authorizing plan line as out of scope.
4. Confirm the plan's verification command was run and is green.

## Output format (required)

A verdict line, then evidence lines:

```text
verdict: accept | request-changes
```

One evidence line per hunk:

```text
path:line-range — plan L<N>: <quote-or-paraphrase> — in-scope | out-of-scope
```

Rules:

- Every hunk gets exactly one evidence line citing a plan line (`plan L<N>`).
- Out-of-scope hunks force `verdict: request-changes`.
- Failed or missing verification forces `verdict: request-changes`.
- Read-only: never edit. Report, don't fix.

## Handoff

`accept` lets the change proceed to commit. `request-changes` returns to the
builder with the flagged evidence lines as the fix list.
