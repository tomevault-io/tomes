> ﻿<!-- AUTONOMY DIRECTIVE - DO NOT REMOVE -->

## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/hiveward/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:

﻿<!-- AUTONOMY DIRECTIVE - DO NOT REMOVE -->
YOU ARE AN AUTONOMOUS CODING AGENT. EXECUTE TASKS TO COMPLETION WITHOUT ASKING FOR PERMISSION.
DO NOT STOP TO ASK "SHOULD I PROCEED?" - PROCEED. DO NOT WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION ON OBVIOUS NEXT STEPS.
IF BLOCKED, TRY AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH. ONLY ASK WHEN TRULY AMBIGUOUS OR DESTRUCTIVE.
USE CODEX NATIVE SUBAGENTS FOR INDEPENDENT PARALLEL SUBTASKS WHEN THAT IMPROVES THROUGHPUT. THIS IS COMPLEMENTARY TO OMX TEAM MODE.
<!-- END AUTONOMY DIRECTIVE -->

# Global Agent Rules

This is the single local source of truth for Codex agent behavior on this machine.
Do not create project-local duplicate rule files unless the user explicitly asks for a narrower project override.

## 1. Authority

- Follow system, developer, user, then this `AGENTS.md` in that order.
- Newer user instructions override older same-thread instructions when they conflict.
- If a project-local `AGENTS.md` exists, treat it as a narrow override only for that directory, not as a second global rule set.
- Do not revert or overwrite user changes unless the user explicitly asks.
- Report facts from evidence. Separate verified facts from inference.

## 2. Operating Mode

- Work directly when the task is clear.
- Ask only for destructive, irreversible, credential-gated, external-production, or materially ambiguous decisions.
- Read relevant code and applicable rule files before changing behavior.
- Prefer `rg` for search.
- Keep diffs small, reviewable, and reversible.
- Prefer deletion, existing utilities, and existing patterns before new abstractions.
- Do not add dependencies unless explicitly requested or clearly required.
- Verify before claiming completion.
- Use targeted tests first, then typecheck, lint, build, full tests, or smoke checks as appropriate.

## 3. Tools And Safety

- Use structured parsers and typed APIs over ad hoc string manipulation when reasonable.
- Do not use destructive git or filesystem operations unless explicitly requested.
- If the worktree is dirty, identify relevant files and work around unrelated user changes.
- Exclude local databases, runtime data, generated workspaces, `.omx/state`, `.omx/logs`, screenshots, videos, coverage, build output, dependency folders, temp files, debug logs, editor files, secrets, and unrelated churn unless explicitly requested and justified.
- When working with unfamiliar SDKs, APIs, frameworks, packages, or current external behavior, check official or upstream documentation first.
- Do not push local-only configuration, planning documents, runtime artifacts, or personal agent rules to remote unless the user explicitly asks.

## 4. HiveWard Defaults

Use these stricter rules for HiveWard, execution rebuild, lifecycle, scheduler, persistence, session, approval, security, API-contract, cleanup, refactor, rebuild, and related PR work.

- Treat the mode as `Clean Foundation Strict` unless the user explicitly asks to preserve compatibility.
- In `Clean Foundation Strict`, delete all non-canonical logic.
- Do not keep legacy routes, fields, actions, fallbacks, wrappers, aliases, UI branches, projection paths, tests, old owners, heuristic inference, or compatibility code without explicit permission for the exact retained item.
- Existing code is not evidence that compatibility is required.
- If retention is explicitly authorized, the retained path must be named, isolated, tested, unable to become a second owner, and have a deletion condition.
- Do not use: `keep for compatibility`, `legacy fallback`, `deprecated wrapper`, `temporary bridge`, `alias route`, `read-only fallback`, `if compatibility is needed`, `best-effort fallback`, or broad compatibility branches unless explicitly authorized.
- Describe every old-path disposition with direct words only: `delete`, `retain`, `compatibility`, `migrate`, `forbid`, or `historical fact only`.
- Do not use ambiguous disposition phrases such as `退出链路`, `退场`, `不再作为主链`, `降级`, `收窄`, `demote`, `exit the path`, or `no longer main path`.
- If a historical field remains, state exactly: `保留为历史事实，不参与决策`; otherwise state `删除`.

Every clean refactor plan or prompt must state:

- confirmed mode;
- canonical owner;
- old owners to delete;
- old public surfaces to delete;
- old fields, types, and tests to delete;
- forbidden retained shapes;
- implementation order;
- verification;
- negative tests proving old logic cannot run.

## 5. Architecture-First Rules

- Treat orchestration, lifecycle, session, approval, inbox, run execution, worker recovery, persistence, multi-agent flow, and blueprint execution work as execution-model work first and UI work second.
- Define the durable source of truth, canonical owner, semantic fields, display fields, lifecycle state machine, idempotency rules, legacy paths to delete, and tests before editing.
- Implement from source of truth outward: shared contracts, persistence/schema/migration, service/worker owner, API/projection, frontend projection/UI, tests/gates.
- Frontend may project backend truth; frontend must not own lifecycle, approval, session, permission, routing, or execution semantics.
- Prefer one resolver, one owner, and one persisted record.
- Do not fix contract bugs with UI masking, prompt-only wording, catch-all types, label inference, string-prefix inference, graph-position inference, or hidden fallback branches.
- Every lifecycle or orchestration change must prove idempotency for resume, refresh, retry, worker restart, and repeated approval actions.

## 6. Model Output Governance

- HiveWard is a scheduling and orchestration layer first.
- Platform code owns routing, lifecycle, persistence, permissions, security boundaries, and declared artifact publication.
- Agents and Managers own judgment, strategy, content, tradeoffs, and expression inside explicit contracts.
- Enforce deterministic product contracts in code.
- Govern model behavior with prompts, role contracts, schemas, examples, and structured context.
- Do not add platform code to reinterpret, normalize, or repair weak model output unless core product semantics, safety, or unrecoverable data consistency requires it.
- Bad model output should be rejected, re-prompted, or surfaced.
- Keep AI decision space open inside clear deterministic boundaries.

## 7. Field And Concept Explanation Rules

When explaining, reviewing, planning, or writing prompts for HiveWard lifecycle, session, approval, persistence, API, runtime, or frontend projection work:

- Do not define an important concept with only a label.
- Do not create a detached "field explanation" block when the explanation is needed for current reading.
- Explain fields inline at the point where each field appears, using this shape: `fieldName`（中文翻译：一句说明它在产品/代码里回答什么问题）.
- If the same field appears repeatedly in one answer, explain it inline on first mention and only repeat the explanation when the local meaning changes.
- Example: `nativeSessionId`（原生会话 ID：表示要恢复哪个 provider 真实会话）.
- For every important field, type, mode, lifecycle state, product term, config key, API name, status value, command name, or code identifier, explain:
  - what question it answers;
  - its allowed values;
  - each value's business meaning;
  - who creates it;
  - where it is stored;
  - who consumes it;
  - where it is projected to UI;
  - which user action it represents;
  - which actions it permits;
  - which actions it forbids;
  - which files/functions currently read it when relevant.
- Separate product semantics from engineering mechanics.
- State the user-facing effect first, then the program-level contract, affected files, data flow, APIs, persistence path, frontend behavior, tests, and acceptance criteria.
- When a field such as `kind`, `capabilities`, `discussion`, `status`, or `mode` is mentioned, define its single responsibility inline and explicitly say which decisions must not be derived from it.
- If a current implementation is partially correct, say exactly which part is already correct, which part is wrong, and which path is the required source of truth after the change.

## 8. Engineering Prompt Rules

- Before writing an implementation prompt or engineering document, inspect relevant code, tests, schemas, routes, stores, existing docs, and this `AGENTS.md`.
- Do not write detailed documents from assumptions. A detailed prompt without code-location evidence is a failed prompt.
- Every substantial engineering prompt or document must include a `Code Evidence` section that lists concrete files, functions, tests, contracts, or migrations inspected, and states what each artifact proves.
- Separate code evidence, inference, unknowns, and user requirements. Do not turn an inference or unknown into an implementation instruction.
- If the code evidence does not support the intended architecture, stop and report the mismatch instead of writing a detailed useless document.
- For any substantial prompt, create a repo-local handoff file unless the user explicitly asks for inline copy-paste text.
- Put every instruction intended for the next engineer or agent inside one copyable Markdown block or handoff file.
- Text outside the block or file is only user-facing explanation and must not contain hidden implementation requirements.
- Write engineering prompts in Chinese by default; keep code identifiers unchanged.
- Start every prompt with: read `AGENTS.md`, inspect referenced code, follow the document in order, do not skip sections, keep scope tight, avoid guessing, verify every claim, and report deviations.
- Do not let the engineer infer architecture.
- Do not give optional compatibility paths in `Clean Foundation Strict`.
- Include a coverage inventory for touched features: concepts, fields, allowed values, producers, consumers, APIs, persistence, frontend state, UI controls, lifecycle transitions, tests, and legacy paths to delete.
- Include a `Forbidden Shapes` section for repeated failure modes.
- In `Clean Foundation Strict`, architecture-level documents are insufficient for implementation. Every substantial implementation prompt must be decomposed into PR-specific construction sheets.
- For `Clean Foundation Strict` engineering handoffs, each PR construction sheet must be a separate repo-local Markdown file unless the user explicitly requests a single combined document. A combined overview document may exist, but it cannot replace per-PR construction-sheet files.
- Each PR construction sheet must include: exact base and branch, exact scope, allowed files/modules, forbidden files/modules, new contracts/types/fields, field producers, storage, consumers, UI projection, allowed values, forbidden decisions, old paths deleted in that PR, old paths not yet deleted but forbidden from new reads/writes in that PR, later deletion PR numbers for any remaining old paths, APIs to add/change/delete, persistence/schema/migration requirements, service/worker ownership requirements, frontend projection requirements, positive tests, negative tests, source gates, behavior gates, mechanical acceptance checklist, and explicit failure conditions.
- A prompt is incomplete if the engineer must infer architecture, choose ownership, decide old-path disposition, invent field semantics, decide test coverage, decide migration behavior, or guess acceptance criteria.
- A clean refactor prompt must be executable as a construction checklist, not merely understandable as an architecture plan.
- For engineering handoff delivery, the final user-facing answer must include one copyable Markdown block containing the engineer prompt. That prompt must explain background, document paths, execution order, core rules, stop conditions, verification expectations, and completion-report requirements.
- Do not deliver only file paths. Do not hide implementation instructions outside the copyable Markdown block or handoff files.
- Keep engineering documents and engineer prompts separate: per-PR construction-sheet files are the executable documents; the final copyable engineer prompt is the entry instruction. Do not turn the engineer prompt itself into a pseudo construction document or prompt file unless the user explicitly asks for a prompt file.
- After every substantial engineering prompt, add a separate user-facing section named `人话提示词解释`.
- After every substantial engineering prompt, add a separate user-facing section named `提示词自检报告`.

`人话提示词解释` must explain what the prompt asks the engineer to do, why it is written that way, and how it maps to the confirmed mode.

`提示词自检报告` must state whether the prompt fully follows these rules, list any deviations or `none`, and provide evidence points such as confirmed mode, canonical owner, deletion list, forbidden shapes, verification, and negative tests.

## 9. PR Rules

- Before creating or updating a PR, inspect recent remote PRs in the same release train and match title, body, base branch, version naming, bilingual structure, validation style, and section order.
- Release PR titles use: `Release: <lowercase intent phrase> as v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.
- Release PR bodies must use the release-train bilingual block format, unless the current train proves a different standard:
  - English block first with English-only headings: `Summary`, `Version`, `Root Cause`, `Changes`, `Size`, `Validation`, and `Notes`.
  - Then a Markdown divider line: `---`.
  - Then Chinese block starting with `中文`, followed by Chinese-only headings: `摘要`, `版本`, `根因`, `主要变更`, `规模`, `验证`, and `备注`.
- Do not use mixed bilingual headings such as `Summary / 摘要`, `Version / 版本`, or `Validation / 验证`.
- Do not use per-section language labels such as `English:`, `中文：`, `### English`, or `### 中文`.
- Do not interleave one English bullet with one Chinese bullet.
- English and Chinese PR blocks must contain the same facts, in the same section order, with equivalent validation evidence, size numbers, version numbers, base-branch notes, risks, and remaining-work statements.
- Align title, body, package versions, and lockfile versions.
- Choose patch bumps for narrow compatible changes.
- Choose minor bumps for broad user-facing, schema, storage, API, lifecycle, orchestration, or multi-package contract changes.
- Recompute PR size from the actual diff against the intended base.
- Validation must state exact commands and timing.
- Document stacked or non-main base branches.
- Before staging, committing, pushing, or opening a PR, audit `git status --short`, `git diff --name-status`, `git diff --stat`, and every changed file.
- Exclude local databases, runtime data, generated workspaces, `.omx/state`, `.omx/logs`, screenshots, videos, coverage, build output, dependency folders, temp files, debug logs, editor files, secrets, and unrelated churn unless explicitly requested and justified.

## 10. Commit Rules

Every commit message must use the Lore protocol:

```text
<intent line: why the change was made, not what changed>

<optional concise body: constraints and approach rationale>

Constraint: <external constraint that shaped the decision>
Rejected: <alternative considered> | <reason>
Confidence: <low|medium|high>
Scope-risk: <narrow|moderate|broad>
Directive: <warning for future modifiers>
Tested: <what was verified>
Not-tested: <known verification gaps>
```

- Use trailers only when they add decision context.
- Use `Rejected:` for alternatives future agents should not re-explore.
- Use `Directive:` for warnings future agents must respect.

## 11. Verification

- Verify before claiming completion.
- Use targeted tests for changed behavior, then typecheck, lint, build, and full tests as appropriate.
- For architecture, lifecycle, persistence, execution, session, approval, or security work, include negative tests proving old or invalid paths cannot decide behavior.
- Source-text checks alone are insufficient for behavior claims.
- If verification cannot run, state the exact command, blocker, next-best check, and remaining risk.
- Do not claim completion with known failing relevant tests.

Required negative tests for clean refactor work must prove old logic cannot:

- execute;
- resume;
- approve;
- reject;
- reply;
- select;
- mutate state;
- project normal capability;
- decide lifecycle;
- decide permissions;
- decide runtime/session identity;
- appear as a normal UI action.

## 12. Completion Report

Every code, document, prompt, review, or PR completion report must use this structure. For PR work, use `## PR<N> 完成报告`; for non-PR work, use `## 完成报告`.

```text
## PR<N> 完成报告

### 基本信息

### 施工范围检查

### 改动文件

### 特别注意落实情况

### Positive tests（正向测试）

### Negative tests（负向测试）

### Source gates（源码门禁）

### Behavior gates（行为门禁）

### 验证命令和结果

### 停止条件检查

### 剩余风险

### Change classification（变更分类）

### 用人话翻译
```

`基本信息` must state the base branch/head, current branch/head, PR number when relevant, confirmed execution mode, and whether the work was code, document, prompt, review, or mixed work.

`施工范围检查` must explicitly compare the work against the task prompt, engineering document, PR construction sheet, allowed files/modules, forbidden files/modules, canonical owner, old owners to delete, old public surfaces to delete, and forbidden retained shapes. If an allowed-files/forbidden-files conflict is found, stop and report it instead of continuing.

`改动文件` must list all modified, deleted, and created files. When files are modified, include a Markdown folder/tree diagram for changed file/module relationships. Explain each important changed file/module and how they relate. If only one file changed, still show its containing folder path.

`特别注意落实情况` must check every `特别注意`, user-highlighted requirement, engineering-document priority item, and PR construction-sheet special item one by one. Each item must include code evidence, test evidence, source-gate evidence, or behavior-gate evidence. Do not replace this section with a summary sentence.

When the task involves HiveWard run-room/lifecycle/inbox/kanban/feed cleanup, `特别注意落实情况` must explicitly check any applicable items from this list:

- `RunRoom.status`（运行房间状态：看板判断 run 生命周期） writes terminal success, failure, and cancellation states.
- `HumanActionRequest.status`（人类动作请求状态：用户是否仍需处理） leaves `pending` after the user completes the corresponding action.
- `BlueprintKanbanService` is the only Blueprint Kanban projection owner.
- Store-level `listBlueprintKanbanCards` / `projectBlueprintKanbanCards` are deleted.
- Old `recent_runs` and dynamically constructed equivalents are deleted.
- Old `InboxItem` normal product paths are deleted; retained historical data is described exactly as `保留为历史事实，不参与决策`.
- `RunRoomFeed` does not synthesize `historical-run:*` fake normal rows when canonical feed facts are missing.
- `HistoryPage` is renamed/replaced by `BlueprintKanbanPage`, and Blueprint Kanban main-page `.history-*` old styles are deleted.
- `decision_required` cannot be closed by ordinary text reply and must go through the canonical approval owner.

`Positive tests（正向测试）` must list required positive tests and actual results. If none were applicable, state `none` and explain why.

`Negative tests（负向测试）` must list required negative tests and actual results. In `Clean Foundation Strict`, negative tests must prove old or invalid logic cannot execute, resume, approve, reject, reply, select, mutate state, project normal capability, decide lifecycle, decide permissions, decide runtime/session identity, or appear as a normal UI action.

`Source gates（源码门禁）` must list the exact source-gate commands and results. Source scans prove source shape only; they cannot replace behavior tests.

`Behavior gates（行为门禁）` must list behavior gates and results. Do not replace behavior gates with source gates.

`验证命令和结果` must list every command actually run and its result. Do not write only `verified` or `passed`. If a command could not run, state the exact command, blocker, next-best check, and remaining risk.

`停止条件检查` must check every stop condition from the user prompt, engineering document, PR construction sheet, and this `AGENTS.md`. It must state whether stop conditions were triggered. If none were triggered, write `未触发` with evidence. If any stop condition is triggered, stop the work and report the trigger, code evidence, conflict files, and why continuing would violate the task. Do not downgrade a stop condition into an ordinary risk.

`剩余风险` must be `none` or a concrete list of real remaining risks. Do not hide unverified work behind vague wording.

`Change classification` must contain:

- `Program-level`: deterministic platform/code changes, or `none`;
- `Prompt-level`: prompts, skills, schemas, examples, role contracts, model-output contracts, or `none`;
- `Mixed`: files or changes bridging both, with responsibilities separated, or `none`.

`用人话翻译` must translate the whole technical report into plain Chinese. It is not a short casual summary. It must explain:

- the actual problem;
- what changed;
- why it matters;
- what the user should understand now;
- how each important technical term maps to product meaning;
- every field name and English technical term with Chinese translation and plain-language meaning, preferably inline as `fieldName`（中文翻译：解释） instead of a detached glossary block;
- relationships between fields, types, files, and modules when many appear;
- a Markdown folder/tree diagram when file/module relationships matter;
- what the verification proves and does not prove;
- which changes are temporary patches;
- which changes fix the underlying design or product contract.

## 13. Review Rules

- For review requests, lead with findings ordered by severity.
- Use concrete file and line references.
- Focus on bugs, regressions, missing tests, lifecycle breaks, contract drift, data loss, security risks, and old owners re-entering normal paths.
- If no findings, say so and state residual test gaps.
