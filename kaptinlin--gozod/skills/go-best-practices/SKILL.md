# Google Go Best Practices

Comprehensive Go coding guide based on Google's internal style guide. Contains 47 rules across 8 categories, prioritized by impact to guide code review, refactoring, and generation.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Writing new Go packages, functions, or methods
- Reviewing Go code for style and correctness
- Refactoring existing Go code
- Designing Go APIs (interfaces, option patterns, error types)
- Writing or improving Go tests

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Guide |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Naming | CRITICAL | [rules/naming.md](rules/naming.md) |
| 2 | Error Handling | CRITICAL | [rules/error.md](rules/error.md) |
| 3 | Design Patterns | HIGH | [rules/design.md](rules/design.md) |
| 4 | Formatting | HIGH | [rules/format.md](rules/format.md) |
| 5 | Documentation | MEDIUM | [rules/doc.md](rules/doc.md) |
| 6 | Testing | MEDIUM | [rules/testing.md](rules/testing.md) |
| 7 | Concurrency | MEDIUM | [rules/concurrency.md](rules/concurrency.md) |
| 8 | Performance | LOW-MEDIUM | [rules/perf.md](rules/perf.md) |

## Quick Reference

### 1. Naming (CRITICAL) — See [rules/naming.md](rules/naming.md)

- Avoid Redundant Naming — don't repeat package, receiver, parameter, or return type info
- Package Naming — short, lowercase, no underscores; avoid `util`, `helper`, `common`
- Receiver Naming — one or two letter abbreviation, consistent across methods
- Constant Naming — MixedCaps only; no ALL_CAPS or k-prefix; name by role not value
- Acronym Casing — consistent: `URL`/`url`, `ID`/`id`, never `Url` or `Id`
- No Get Prefix — use nouns for accessors, verbs for actions
- Variable Naming — length proportional to scope; omit type info
- Function Naming — nouns for return-value functions, verbs for actions

### 2. Error Handling (CRITICAL) — See [rules/error.md](rules/error.md)

- Structured Errors — use sentinel values or typed errors, not string matching
- Add Non-Redundant Context — meaningful wrapping without duplication
- %v vs %w — `%v` at boundaries, `%w` for programmatic inspection
- %w Position — place at end: `"context: %w"`
- Return error Interface — not concrete types
- Handle Errors Explicitly — never silently discard with `_`
- Indent Error Flow — handle errors first, keep success path unindented
- Avoid In-Band Errors — use multiple returns instead of special values
- Error Logging — don't double-log; guard expensive log calls

### 3. Design Patterns (HIGH) — See [rules/design.md](rules/design.md)

- Interfaces Belong to Consumers — define in consumer, return concrete from producer
- Option Structs — for many callers needing many params
- Variadic Options — functional options when most callers need no config
- Avoid Global State — provide instance-based APIs
- Pass Values — not pointers for small fixed-size types
- Receiver Types — pointer for mutation/large; value for small immutable
- Generics — use only when genuinely needed
- Context Conventions — always first param, never in structs

### 4. Formatting (HIGH) — See [rules/format.md](rules/format.md)

- Always gofmt — use `gofmt` or `goimports`
- Import Grouping — stdlib, third-party, proto, side-effect
- Import Renaming — only for conflicts; proto uses `pb` suffix
- Struct Literal Fields — use field names; omit zero values
- Nil Slices — prefer `var t []string` over `t := []string{}`
- Function Formatting — keep signatures on one line; extract locals
- Variable Declarations — `:=` for non-zero, `var` for zero, `new()` for pointers
- Conditions — extract complex conditions; no Yoda; no redundant `break`

### 5. Documentation (MEDIUM) — See [rules/doc.md](rules/doc.md)

- Doc Comments — exported names start with symbol name as complete sentence
- Package Comments — one per package above `package` clause
- Parameter Docs — only document non-obvious parameters
- Cleanup Docs — document cleanup requirements and error sentinels
- Signal Boosting — add comments for code that looks standard but isn't

### 6. Testing (MEDIUM) — See [rules/testing.md](rules/testing.md)

- Table-Driven Tests — with named fields and descriptions
- No Assertion Libraries — `testing` package only
- Got Before Want — format: `Func(%v) = %v, want %v`
- Test Helpers — call `t.Helper()`; prefix must-succeed with `must`
- Scoped Setup — explicit per test; no package-level `init()`
- Error Semantics — test with `errors.Is`, not strings
- Goroutine Fatal — use `t.Error` not `t.Fatal` from goroutines

### 7. Concurrency (MEDIUM) — See [rules/concurrency.md](rules/concurrency.md)

- Goroutine Lifetimes — use WaitGroup to bound lifetimes
- Synchronous Functions — prefer sync; callers add concurrency
- Channel Direction — specify `<-chan` or `chan<-` in signatures
- No Copy — never copy `sync.Mutex` or types with pointer methods
- No Panic — use errors for normal failures; panic only for invariants
- Variable Shadowing — watch for `:=` shadowing in inner scopes

### 8. Performance (LOW-MEDIUM) — See [rules/perf.md](rules/perf.md)

- String Concatenation — `+` for simple, `Sprintf` for format, `Builder` for loops
- Size Hints — pre-allocate with justified hints only
- %q Format — use for readable string output
- crypto/rand — for keys, never `math/rand`
- Use any — instead of `interface{}` in new code
