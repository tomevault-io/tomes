# Benchmark Radar

Use the local `benchmark-radar` CLI as the source of truth. Keep the user's purpose,
selection criteria, and desired output open unless they specify them.

## Prepare the data

Carry this out yourself, without handing the user a checklist. Installing this Skill
is the request to use the CLI, so an install or repair the steps below call for is
part of that request: say you are installing the CLI from the official repository, then run it and report what you ran. Ask first only when the user
told you not to install anything.

1. Check availability with `benchmark-radar status --json`.
2. If the command is missing or exits before returning a JSON status response, the CLI
   is missing or broken. Install it:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/ktwu01/benchmark-radar.git'
   ```

   If an existing installation cannot import `benchmark_radar`, repair it cleanly:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install --force-reinstall 'git+https://github.com/ktwu01/benchmark-radar.git'
   ```

   Install into the Python environment whose `pip` the user's shell resolves. If that
   environment is externally managed and refuses the install, say which environment
   failed and what would fix it rather than forcing the package in.

3. If the CLI reports `not_initialized`, run `benchmark-radar init --json`; that
   successful init is already current, so do not immediately sync again.
4. Otherwise, when the request depends on current data, run
   `benchmark-radar sync --json` once before querying. Skip sync when the user asks
   to stay offline or retain a fixed local version. If sync fails, report it instead
   of silently presenting stale data as current.

When the user asks only to set up Benchmark Radar (or after installing without a
specific benchmark query), finish the steps above and report the data version. Then
provide an immediate starter use case so the user can see it in action right away
without having to formulate a query: automatically search for recent or popular agent
benchmarks (for example, `benchmark-radar search "agent" --scope catalog --json` or
recent Radar evidence), present a concise summary of top results as an example showcase,
and show how the user can query further (e.g., searching by specific task domain,
inspecting details with `show`, or tracking recent evidence).

## Choose the smallest command

- Discover records:
  `benchmark-radar search "<query>" --scope catalog|radar|all --json`
- Inspect one known key or slug:
  `benchmark-radar show "<identifier>" --json`
- Inspect the newest Radar evidence:
  `benchmark-radar recent --json`
- Check local data and provenance:
  `benchmark-radar status --json`
- Start the local HTTP interface only when requested:
  `benchmark-radar serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765`

Use `catalog` for normalized benchmark records and `radar` for observed recent
evidence. Search them separately during discovery: a Radar item is a lead such as
a paper, repository, or dataset, not a verified catalog benchmark. Use `all` only
when the user explicitly wants one mixed evidence list; never compare ranking
scores across the two layers.

Search is deterministic lexical/token matching, not semantic search. Any shared
token can retrieve a candidate. BM25F is the main retrieval score, with controlled
name and phrase boosts; IDF coverage is a tie-breaker and explanation, not a
service-side acceptance decision. The `retrieval_score` is query-local ranking
evidence, not confidence and not comparable across queries. Partial matches remain
visible with matched and missing tokens so you can judge them against the user's request. A search result
is a candidate, not a suitability claim. For topical discovery, use two to four
short, discriminative variants drawn from the user's stated need:

1. the task phrase, such as `medical VQA`;
2. one terminology or morphology variant, such as `robotics manipulation`;
3. a task-plus-modality variant when the user supplied that constraint;
4. a known benchmark name only when the user named it or a result supplies it.

Do not add unrelated requirements or generate a large query spray. Keep which
query produced each candidate. A candidate found by several variants is useful
support, but raw BM25F scores are query-specific and must not be added or compared
across queries.

Interpret `search_status: full_matches_found` as complete lexical coverage in at
least one candidate, not proof of suitability. Interpret `partial_candidates_only`
as inspectable evidence that still needs query refinement or record review, never as
an answer. Interpret `no_lexical_candidates` as “no record shared any query token in
this local data version,” not proof that no such benchmark exists. If Catalog
candidates remain insufficient and recent discovery is relevant, search `radar` with
the same task terms and label every result as unverified Radar evidence.

Use `--json` for agent work; omit it only when the user wants terminal-friendly
text. Apply supported filters only when they come from the request. Do not run
maintainer commands such as `normalize-catalog`, `classify`, or
`build-data-release` for ordinary use.

The service does not decide whether a benchmark satisfies the user's intent. After
retrieval, the Agent should remove conversational wrapper text from the next query,
compare a small set of focused variants, inspect `missing_tokens` and
`idf_coverage`, and call `show` for any candidate it may present as suitable. The
Agent may report `no confident match` when the details do not support the request;
that is an agent judgment, not a lexical search status.

Before presenting a catalog record as suitable, call `show` and check that its
description, modality, artifacts, openness, and provenance support the user's
actual criteria. Use `matched_tokens`, `missing_tokens`, `matched_fields`, and the
record detail as evidence for your own final relevance judgment. Return relevant
records and their match reasons. Preserve the reported `data_version`,
`retrieval_mode`, and query provenance. Distinguish catalog records from Radar
evidence, and do not turn search results into a recommendation unless the user asked
for one.
