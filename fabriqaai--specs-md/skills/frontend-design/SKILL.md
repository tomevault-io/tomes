This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant color with intentional accents. Consider gradients, but make them subtle and purposeful.
- **Spacing & Layout**: Generous whitespace creates luxury. Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for sophisticated layouts. Consider asymmetry for visual interest.
- **Micro-interactions**: Thoughtful hover states, transitions, and animations. Make interactions feel alive but not overwhelming. 200-400ms transitions feel natural.
- **Visual Details**: Subtle shadows, borders, and textures add depth. Consider backdrop-blur for modern glass effects. Rounded corners should be consistent throughout.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach. Breakpoints at 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px. Touch targets minimum 44px.

## Implementation Patterns

### CSS Architecture
```css
:root {
  /* Colors */
  --color-primary: #...;
  --color-secondary: #...;
  --color-background: #...;
  --color-surface: #...;
  --color-text: #...;
  --color-text-muted: #...;

  /* Typography */
  --font-display: '...', serif;
  --font-body: '...', sans-serif;
  --font-mono: '...', monospace;

  /* Spacing */
  --space-xs: 0.25rem;
  --space-sm: 0.5rem;
  --space-md: 1rem;
  --space-lg: 2rem;
  --space-xl: 4rem;

  /* Effects */
  --radius-sm: 4px;
  --radius-md: 8px;
  --radius-lg: 16px;
  --shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);
  --shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  --shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  --transition: 200ms ease;
}
```

### Animation Principles
- Entrance animations: fade + slight translate (20px max)
- Hover states: scale(1.02-1.05), color shifts, shadow elevation
- Loading states: skeleton screens over spinners
- Scroll animations: intersection observer, staggered reveals

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML elements
- ARIA labels where needed
- Focus states visible and styled
- Color contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
- Reduced motion preference respected

## Quality Checklist

Before completion, verify:
- [ ] Distinctive visual identity (not generic)
- [ ] Consistent design system applied
- [ ] Responsive across breakpoints
- [ ] Smooth interactions and transitions
- [ ] Accessible (keyboard, screen reader)
- [ ] Performance optimized (no layout shifts)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatible
- [ ] Dark mode support (if applicable)

## Output Format

Deliver complete, production-ready code:
1. HTML structure (semantic, accessible)
2. CSS (organized, using variables)
3. JavaScript (if interactive elements needed)
4. Usage instructions if complex

Focus on quality over quantity. A beautifully crafted component is better than a feature-complete but generic one.
