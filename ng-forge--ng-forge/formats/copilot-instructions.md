# General Guidelines for working with Nx

- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through `nx` (i.e. `nx run`, `nx run-many`, `nx affected`) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- You have access to the Nx MCP server and its tools, use them to help the user
- When answering questions about the repository, use the `nx_workspace` tool first to gain an understanding of the workspace architecture where applicable.
- When working in individual projects, use the `nx_project_details` mcp tool to analyze and understand the specific project structure and dependencies
- For questions around nx configuration, best practices or if you're unsure, use the `nx_docs` tool to get relevant, up-to-date docs. Always use this instead of assuming things about nx configuration
- If the user needs help with an Nx configuration or project graph error, use the `nx_workspace` tool to get any errors

# ng-forge Development Guidelines

## Working Style

- **Spawn subagents if you believe the task is better to be divided**
- **Never jump to implementation without explicit user approval.** When asked to analyze, plan, or investigate, stay in analysis mode until the user says to proceed with code changes
- **Always scope changes precisely to what was requested.** Do not apply changes globally when they should be limited to a specific file, component, or example. When in doubt, ask
- **When the user describes a design constraint or architectural principle, treat it as absolute.** Do not attempt to relax, work around, or make stated design principles optional
- **Keep plans concise and correct on the first attempt.** Do not over-engineer solutions. If the user says the plan is too complex, simplify immediately rather than rewriting with similar complexity
- **When adding workarounds like arbitrary delays or skipping tests, flag them as code smells** and propose a proper fix first. Only use workarounds as a last resort with explicit user approval
- **When working with git operations, confirm the target branch, repo directory, and scope** before executing. Never run destructive git operations without confirmation

```

**Dependency direction:** UI adapters depend on core. Core has zero knowledge of adapters. Adapters provide field components + mappers that plug into core's registry via `provideDynamicForm(...withMaterialFields())`.

**Data flow:** `FormConfig` → `FormStateManager` (state machine + field resolution) → `ResolvedField[]` (component + injector + inputs signal) → `NgComponentOutlet` renders each field.

## Environment

- **Node.js**: `>=24.0.0`
- **pnpm**: `>=10.0.0`
- **Angular**: `~21.1.0`
- **TypeScript**: `~5.9.2`
- **Nx**: `22.4.5`
- **Docs app**: AnalogJS (file-based routing, SSR pre-rendering). Route components use `default` exports. Be aware of Vite/Nx cache issues — suggest cache clearing (`nx reset`) when encountering ghost errors after config changes

## MCP Server Synchronization

The `@ng-forge/dynamic-form-mcp` package provides an MCP server for AI-assisted form schema generation. **When making changes to the dynamic-forms library that affect behavior, configuration, or APIs, you MUST also update the MCP server accordingly.**

Update `packages/dynamic-form-mcp/` when adding/modifying field types, validators, field configuration options, UI adapter features, form configuration schema, or API surface/behavior. Registry data lives directly in TypeScript source files under `packages/dynamic-form-mcp/src/registry/`.

## Code Style

### Angular API Usage

- **Investigate real Angular APIs before implementing custom solutions.** We wrap Angular APIs, we don't reinvent them. Keep wrappers thin
- **Do NOT set `standalone: true`** in component/directive decorators — it's the default in Angular v20+
- Use `input()`, `output()`, `model()`, `computed()`, `linkedSignal()`, `viewChild()`, `viewChildren()` — never decorators
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in all components
- Use `inject()` instead of constructor injection
- Put host bindings inside the `host` object of `@Component`/`@Directive`, not `@HostBinding`/`@HostListener`
- Use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`), not structural directives
- Use `class` bindings instead of `ngClass`, `style` bindings instead of `ngStyle`
- Prefer Reactive forms over Template-driven
- Use `runInInjectionContext()` when creating forms outside constructor/field initializers
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for static images (not for inline base64)

### Effects and Reactivity

- **Use `explicitEffect` from ngxtension instead of `effect()`** for explicit dependency declaration:
  ```typescript
  explicitEffect([this.someSignal], ([value]) => {
    /* side effect */
  });
  ```
- **Use `derivedFrom` from ngxtension for async signal derivations** (RxJS pipelines → signal):
  ```typescript
  readonly result = derivedFrom([this.config], pipe(switchMap(([c]) => this.http(c))));
  ```
- **Use `outputFromObservable()`** for converting signal changes to output events

### Type Safety

- **Avoid `any` at all costs.** Use `unknown`, generics, type guards, and conditional types
- **Use `is*` type guards** for discriminated unions
- Use `isSignal()` from `@angular/core` for runtime signal checks
- Use `as const satisfies` for configuration objects
- When type casting is necessary, document why it's safe with a comment

### Import Rules

- **In `packages/dynamic-forms/`, do NOT import from barrel files (index.ts).** Import directly from the specific file to avoid circular dependencies:
  ```typescript
  import { SomeType } from './models/types/some-type'; // correct
  // NOT: import { SomeType } from './models';           // creates cycles
  ```

### Code Patterns

- Write declaratively: `computed()` for derived state, reactive streams for data flow, configuration-driven over procedural
- Prefer `untracked()` when reading signals without establishing a dependency
- Use custom injection tokens with factory functions that throw descriptive errors when context is missing
- Use `memoize()` utility (`packages/dynamic-forms/src/lib/utils/memoize.ts`) for expensive repeated computations
- Prefer scoped services over `providedIn: 'root'` when the service is only needed in a specific feature tree

### SSR Compatibility

- **Never use module-scoped mutable state** (Maps, caches, singletons outside DI). These break SSR because they're shared across requests
- Use Angular's DI system for all caching and state. Injection tokens scoped to the component tree are SSR-safe
- **When debugging SSR/hydration issues**, expect multi-layered problems. Never dismiss visual artifacts (white flash, FOUC, skeleton issues) as resolved without browser verification. Check hydration mismatch errors, `@defer` interactions with SSR, and inline critical CSS ordering
- **Verify SSR fixes in both modes**: dev server (`pnpm serve:docs`) AND production build. A fix that works in dev may break in production SSR and vice versa

## Error Handling

- **Use `DynamicFormError`** with the `[Dynamic Forms]` prefix for library errors
- Throw descriptive errors from injection tokens when context is missing
- Log warnings for recoverable issues; throw for unrecoverable ones
- Use the `DynamicFormLogger` injection token for customizable logging

## Cross-Library Changes

When implementing a feature across all 4 UI adapter libraries:

1. **Define the shared contract first** — the interface, behavior, and test criteria
2. **Use subagents per library** — spawn parallel Task agents, each scoped to one library directory, implementing against the shared contract
3. **Each agent should**: read existing patterns in its library, implement following those conventions, run that library's tests
4. **After all complete**: review together, run the full build (`pnpm build:libs`), create a single commit
5. **No agent should modify files outside its library scope**

## Verification

- **Never claim a UI or styling fix is complete without verifying it.** Use Playwright MCP to navigate to the affected page, take a screenshot, and confirm the fix visually. If the dev server isn't running, start it first
- **After making styling, template, or build-affecting changes, run `nx build <project>`** (or `pnpm build:libs` for cross-library changes) and confirm no errors before reporting success. Silent SCSS failures and build breakage must be caught immediately
- **For docs site changes**, start the dev server (`pnpm serve:docs`) and verify in the browser — check both light and dark mode if relevant

## Quality Assurance

- **When working on a feature, ensure all checks pass:** tests, build, lint
- Remove dead code, unused imports, and commented-out code when refactoring
- Update all references when renaming, moving, or deleting code
- Code must pass AXE checks and follow WCAG AA minimums (focus management, color contrast, ARIA attributes)

## E2E Testing

- **Playwright-based**, located in `apps/examples/sandbox/src/app/testing/{material,bootstrap,primeng,ionic,core}/`
- **Sandbox uses hash routing**: `http://localhost:4210/#/{adapter}/test/{suite}/{scenario}`
- **Run locally for fast iteration**: `nx run sandbox-examples:e2e-material` (screenshots will differ from CI — that's expected)
- **Use Docker for screenshot updates only**: `pnpm e2e:material:update` (ensures cross-platform consistency)
- **Never run `--update-snapshots` locally** outside Docker — creates platform-specific screenshots that fail in CI
- **Clean Docker cache** when upgrading Playwright, seeing cache warnings, or unexpected behavior: `pnpm e2e:clean`
- See `/e2e-update` skill for the full workflow

## Debugging Guidelines

- **Diagnose root causes before proposing fixes.** Don't chase the first symptom; investigate whether the real cause is elsewhere
- **Share your hypothesis** before implementing a fix. State what you think is wrong and why, so the user can redirect early if needed
- **When a fix attempt fails twice, stop and reassess** the approach entirely rather than continuing to iterate on the same strategy. Ask the user if they have context on the root cause
- **Arbitrary delays, `setTimeout` workarounds, and skipped tests are code smells.** If you find yourself reaching for one, stop and investigate the underlying timing or lifecycle issue
- **For reactive/signal bugs**: check for circular dependencies in computed chains, verify `untracked()` usage, and check `explicitEffect` dependency arrays
- **For E2E flakiness**: Firefox has pre-existing flakiness across array-fields, row-fields, group-fields, multi-page, and expression-logic suites. Don't spend time debugging Firefox-only failures unless specifically asked

## Commit Messages

**Angular-style conventional commits for PR titles.** PRs are squash-merged, so only the PR title matters for the changelog. Validated by commitlint in CI.

**Do NOT add** `Co-authored-by: Claude`, `Generated by AI`, or any AI attribution.

## graphify

This project has a graphify knowledge graph at graphify-out/.

Rules:

- Before answering architecture or codebase questions, read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md for god nodes and community structure
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, navigate it instead of reading raw files
- For cross-module "how does X relate to Y" questions, prefer `graphify query "<question>"`, `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"`, or `graphify explain "<concept>"` over grep — these traverse the graph's EXTRACTED + INFERRED edges instead of scanning files
- After modifying code files in this session, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost)
