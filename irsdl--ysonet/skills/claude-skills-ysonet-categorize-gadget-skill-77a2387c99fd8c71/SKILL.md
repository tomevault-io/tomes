# Categorize a ysonet gadget

Classify only facts supported by the gadget code, tests, or project
documentation. Keep missing facts visible as `uncategorized`; never guess a
more useful-looking value.

## 1. Read the evidence

Read:

- `CLAUDE.md` and the gadget sections of `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- The complete generator, including `Generate`, `Options`, `Variants`, `Labels`,
  `AdditionalInfo`, `CommandInput`, and `SupportedFormatters`.
- Any inner generator, bridge, helper, bundled assembly, or target type on which
  the gadget depends.
- Focused tests for the gadget and its variants.

Confirm whether `GadgetFacetSet` and `GadgetFacetReader` exist. If they do not,
report proposed values only and say that the category implementation is pending.
Do not create a parallel metadata scheme.

## 2. Classify effective capability units

- A gadget without variants has one unit.
- Variants with identical facts inherit the gadget facets.
- A variant with different kind, accepted input, or requirements gets a complete
  `FacetOverride`.
- Never combine one variant's formatter, input, or requirements with another's.
- A gadget that subclasses ANOTHER gadget (not `GenericGenerator` directly, for
  example `ActivitySurrogateSelectorFromFile` extends `ActivitySurrogateSelector`,
  and `DataSetTypeSpoof` extends `DataSet`) inherits the parent gadget's `Facets()`
  unless it overrides them. Its capability often differs from the parent, so
  classify it on its own evidence and give it its own `Facets()` instead of
  trusting the inherited default.

Formatter is already metadata. Start with `SupportedFormatters()` and remove the
variant's `UnsupportedFormatters`.

## 3. Use the small vocabulary

Every declared axis can contain multiple proven values.

### Payload kind

Choose broad discovery families only:

- `code-execution`
- `file-system`
- `network`
- `information-disclosure`
- `denial-of-service`
- `nested-deserialization`
- `other`
- `uncategorized`

Do not create values for an individual sink, CVE, protocol, or operation. For
example, file read/write/delete can share `file-system`, and DNS/SMB/callbacks can
share `network`, when the behavior is proven. A working-directory change is not
automatically `file-system`: use `other` if the behavior is known but does not fit
the broad vocabulary, or `uncategorized` if the behavior is not established.

Input type is not payload kind. Reading a source file on the generator does not
make the target payload an information-disclosure gadget.

### Accepted input

Use these user-provided forms:

- `command`
- `local-file` (read on the OPERATOR machine while building)
- `target-path` (a path only the TARGET process touches)
- `unc-path`
- `host` (a bare host name or IP the target reaches)
- `remote-url`
- `source-code-file`
- `assembly-file`
- `none`
- `other`
- `uncategorized`

Normally omit `.WithInputs(...)` and let the reader derive the value from the
effective `CommandInputType`. The full table is `GadgetFacetReader.DeriveInput`,
which has one arm per enum member:

| CommandInputType | Accepted input |
|---|---|
| `ShellCommand` | `command` |
| `CsSourceFile` | `source-code-file` |
| `DllPath` | `assembly-file` |
| `UncPath` | `unc-path` |
| `HostName` | `host` |
| `Url` | `remote-url` |
| `FilePath` | `local-file` |
| `TargetPath` | `target-path` |
| `TargetPathPair` | `target-path` |
| `TargetPathAndLocalFile` | `target-path` |
| `Ignored` | `none` |

The path types say WHOSE file system a path belongs to, and that is the one thing
a user has to get right on a file gadget: `local-file` is read here while
building, `target-path` is only touched by the deserializing process. Do not fold
them together.

Override the derived value only when code proves additional or different forms:
both `local-file` and `unc-path` for a gadget that accepts either, or
`remote-url` plus `target-path` for one whose `-c` is a URL and whose second
option names a file on the target. Distinguish a file ysonet consumes from a path
the generated payload uses in the detailed help.

### Requirements

Use broad target needs:

- `built-in`
- `extra-assembly`
- `wpf`
- `net-framework`
- `modern-dotnet`
- `other`
- `uncategorized`

Multiple requirements can apply. Do not confuse a generator build dependency
with a target requirement. Keep exact assembly names, products, and versions in
`AdditionalInfo()` or `Labels()`.

`other` means a proven fact falls outside the vocabulary. `uncategorized` means
the evidence is missing or has not been reviewed. Never combine
`uncategorized` with another value on the same axis.

### Runtime versions

This axis is the one exception to the broad-vocabulary rule: it carries exact
build numbers, because "old build" does not tell an operator whether the payload
lands. Tokens live in `RuntimeVersion`: `net-fx-2.0` through `net-fx-4.8.1`,
`net-5.0` through `net-10.0`, `mono`, plus `other` and `unspecified`.

- THE VERSION DESCRIBES THE TARGET, never ysonet and never the machine the
  payload was built on. Ask "what does the operator have to check on the app in
  front of them". That is usually the framework the target PROCESS RUNS ON, but
  when the gate is a compile-time compatibility switch it is the framework the
  target APPLICATION WAS BUILT AGAINST (its `TargetFrameworkAttribute`). Both are
  versions and both get declared. `DataViewManagerXxe` and `DataSetXxe` are the
  worked example: `EnableLegacyXmlSettings()` reads the entry assembly's
  attribute, so an app stamped below 4.5.2 is exploitable on a fully patched
  machine and one stamped 4.5.2+ is not on any build - they declare 4.0 - 4.5.1,
  and that span is about the app. Both were wrongly left `unspecified` at first
  because the reviewer measured ysonet's own build instead of the target's.
- A new or changed runtime-gated gadget must name at least one evidence-backed
  working version. Test the current/latest candidate first. If it does not fire
  because of runtime compatibility, reproduce on older supported target
  versions and use the highest verified working version, never the failed latest
  version. Record the latest tested non-working version in `AdditionalInfo()` or
  the gadget docs.
- Use a single token when only one target version is established. Declare a contiguous
  span with `RuntimeVersion.Range(first, last)` only when evidence supports the
  whole span; `Range` refuses a reversed pair and one that crosses runtime
  families.
- A declaration means "reproduced or documented here", never "fails everywhere
  else". An unlisted version means nobody recorded it.
- Leave `unspecified` when the real gate is not a version at all: an OS patch
  (PSObject and CVE-2017-8565), a library version, or a machine-wide switch
  somebody can toggle. That detail belongs in `AdditionalInfo()`. A gate that IS
  a framework version threshold does not qualify, even when the threshold is on
  the target app's build rather than the installed runtime - declare it. For an
  existing gadget, missing version evidence can remain visibly `unspecified`;
  for a new runtime-gated gadget it is an unresolved finding, not a finished
  declaration.
- Never fill this axis in to make a gadget look better documented. `unspecified`
  is the honest and expected value for most of the catalog.

## 4. Apply requested changes

When the user asks for edits:

1. Override `Facets()` for the normal gadget facts. Build the set fluently:
   `new GadgetFacetSet().WithKinds(...).WithRequirements(...)`. Each `WithKinds`,
   `WithInputs`, `WithRequirements`, and `WithVersions` REPLACES its whole axis. The
   constructor defaults Kinds and Requirements to `uncategorized`, Versions to
   `unspecified`, and leaves Inputs null so the reader derives accepted input from
   the effective `CommandInputType`. Omit `WithInputs(...)` whenever that derived
   value is correct, and omit `WithVersions(...)` unless the evidence names versions.
2. Add a complete `FacetOverride` only to a variant that differs, via
   `variant.WithFacets(new GadgetFacetSet()...)`. The override must declare full
   Kinds, Requirements, and Versions (it replaces the whole set, so a version the
   gadget declared is lost unless repeated); leave its Inputs null when the variant's
   effective `Input` derives the right value.
3. Keep metadata beside the gadget; do not add a production name-to-facet table.
4. Correct stale `Labels()` or `AdditionalInfo()` found during the review.
5. Update the gadget row and facet contract in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
6. Add focused coverage for meaningful variant distinctions or new values.
7. Confirm `--category=axis=value`, filtered `--list gadgets`, and gadget help
   expose each effective unit correctly.
8. Run the project's normal Debug build.

Do not change payload generation to make a category convenient. Do not add plugin
metadata. For a catalog-wide consistency review, use
`$ysonet-audit-gadget-metadata`.

## 5. Report the result

Report one row per effective unit:

| Unit | Payload kind | Formatters | Accepted input | Requirements | Runtime versions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gadget or variant | values | values | values | values | values |

Call out inherited facts, every `uncategorized` or `unspecified` axis and its missing evidence,
exact target dependencies, changed files, and verification results.

## Final checks

- Every fact has code, test, or project-documentation evidence.
- Values are broad, and multiple proven values are retained.
- Input is derived unless an override is necessary.
- Variants remain internally consistent.
- `other` and `uncategorized` retain different meanings.
- Every new runtime-gated gadget names at least one verified working version; if
  latest failed, the highest verified working and latest tested non-working
  versions are recorded.
- Runtime versions are declared only where evidence names them, with a single
  token or an evidence-backed contiguous range, never to look complete.
- Formatter values match effective variant support.
- No plugin facet work was introduced.
