description: Creates or scaffolds a new ysonet IGenerator gadget from verified technique code. It checks uniqueness, gathers missing requirements and credits, classifies facets, systematically attempts the maximum plausible formatter and serializer set, implements real formatter and bridge behavior, registers the source, adds focused and runtime-effect tests, updates the public catalogs, and runs Debug and FULL verification. Use when the user asks to add, create, or scaffold a gadget and expects implementation. Use ysonet-dev-create-plan when the requested deliverable is only a plan. Not for plugins or small edits to an existing gadget.

# Create a ysonet gadget

Build a truthful, working gadget end to end. Never weaken a test, invent a
credit, or register one gadget name while returning another gadget's payload.

## Quality bar

Quality comes before a quick "it generates bytes". The gadget is done when it
is right and complete, not when the first formatter works.

- Take the durable route. When a better implementation lasts longer and makes
  the next gadget easier to add, do that one, even when it is more work.
- Do not stop at the minimum. Every plausible serializer, every variant, every
  option, every `IGenerator` member, tests, docs, help, and catalogs are part of
  the gadget, not extras.
- Fix root causes. A special case, a copy-paste of another generator, or a
  "for now" patch is acceptable only when a hard constraint blocks the proper
  fix, and then it needs a `dev-kitchen/todo/` note stating the proper fix.
- Use the existing helpers, base classes, and test patterns. If a shared helper
  is genuinely wrong for this gadget, improve the shared helper instead of
  bypassing it, so later gadgets benefit.
- Never trade correctness or test integrity for a green tick or a faster
  finish. An unproven cell is unproven, not "supported".
- If quality work needs more scope or a maintainer decision, ask. Do not
  silently ship a narrower gadget.

## Integrity gate

A registered gadget must implement its stated technique. Automatic generation
tests only prove that it returns bytes or text; they do not prove that the named
chain is present.

- Do not use an existing leaf gadget as the completed body of a different
  gadget.
- Do not add the csproj entry, public documentation row, or supported status
  until at least one real formatter branch works.
- If the technique source or a material design fact is unavailable, ask for it.
  If the user explicitly wants a draft, keep it unregistered under
  `dev-kitchen/dirty/` and label it incomplete. Do not make the product or tests
  claim that the gadget exists.
- List only formatter and variant combinations that the real implementation
  produces. Assert a proven framework limitation as an expected failure; never
  hide it with a skip or substitute payload.

## Workflow

### 1. Load the current contract

Read:

- `CLAUDE.md`, the shared memory index and its listed files;
- gadget, test, build, and documentation sections of
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`;
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`;
- `references/interview-questions.md`;
- `references/formatter-expansion.md`;
- `.claude/skills/ysonet-dev-create-plan/references/making-a-gadget.md`;
- the complete closest generators, their helpers, and their focused tests; and
- `assets/GadgetGenerator.template.cs` before using the template.

Resolve `references/` and `assets/` paths relative to this skill's directory.
Treat documentation as a map and the current source as authoritative.

### 2. Check uniqueness before editing

Search the architecture gadget table, `docs/gadgets-and-plugins.md`, and
`ysonet/Generators/` for the same primitive, sink, carrier, or target behavior.
Compare variants as well as class names. If the proposal substantially overlaps
an existing gadget, show the evidence and get the maintainer's decision before
creating a second public gadget.

### 3. Establish the evidence

Answer repository-checkable questions from source first. Ask only for material
facts that cannot be discovered, such as intended scope, original research
credit, or unavailable technique code. Record:

- the source or write-up for the technique;
- original researchers and the ysonet implementer;
- target-side types, assemblies, runtime versions, and patched limitations;
- the meaning of `-c`, options, variants, and the formatter candidate matrix;
- whether it consumes an upstream payload and in which formatter; and
- the observable runtime effect and safe test-owned sink.

Do not guess. Preserve an unknown as unknown instead of choosing convenient
metadata.

### 4. Classify the gadget

Use `$ysonet-categorize-gadget` to derive `Facets()` for the gadget and any
variant overrides from the verified evidence. If named-skill invocation is not
available, read and follow
`.claude/skills/ysonet-categorize-gadget/SKILL.md` directly. Use only the
vocabulary in `ysonet/Generators/Base/IGenerator.cs`. Omit
`WithInputs(...)` when `CommandInput()` derives the correct input. Keep an
unproven axis `uncategorized`, and never mix it with a real value on the same
axis.

Decide the runtime version axis here too, and do it last, after the runtime
effect test in step 8 has actually fired the payload. Every runtime-gated gadget
or variant must name at least one evidence-backed WORKING VERSION before it is
finished:

- identify what target property the version describes: normally the framework
  the target process runs on, but for a compile-time compatibility gate it is
  the target application's `TargetFrameworkAttribute`. Never use ysonet's build
  merely because it is easy to read.
- first test the current/latest candidate. Run FULL and read the `Runtime:` line
  and the version report at the end of the execution matrix; a gadget that fired
  but declares nothing is listed there by name.
- if the effect does not fire on the latest candidate and the difference is a
  runtime-version gate, do not use that version as the ceiling and do not finish
  with vague compatibility. Reproduce on older supported target versions
  (installed runtime or target-app stamp, as applicable) until at least one
  fires, then use the highest verified working version as the ceiling. Record
  the latest tested non-working version and the limitation in the gadget
  documentation or `AdditionalInfo()`.
- the FLOOR is the documented introduction of the types the chain needs. Default
  `RuntimeVersion.NetFx40` (the CLR v4 generation this tool targets);
  `NetFx45` when the chain goes through `System.Security.Claims`, WIF, or
  `Comparer<T>.Create`. Microsoft documentation is acceptable evidence for a
  floor.
- use a single token when only one target version is verified. Use
  `.WithVersions(RuntimeVersion.Range(floor, ceiling))` only when the evidence
  supports that contiguous span. Repeat the declaration in every variant
  `FacetOverride` (an override replaces the whole set; a standing test fails the
  build when one variant declares versions and another does not).
- leave `unspecified` when the gadget's real gate is not a runtime version at
  all (an OS patch, a library version, a config switch). That gate belongs in
  `AdditionalInfo()`. If the gate is a runtime version but no working version has
  been established, the gadget remains unverified and unfinished; never guess.

### 5. Implement the real chain

Copy `assets/GadgetGenerator.template.cs` to the normal generator location only
when enough evidence exists to implement the real chain. Replace the name token,
resolve every TODO, and delete optional template sections that do not apply.
Match the closest generator's structure.

Keep the whole payload in the gadget's own file. This is a hard rule, and
`ysonet/Generators/README.md` is the contract:

- Payload templates, target type names, member names and the ORDER they are
  written in, and any surrogate shape (declared as a nested type in the generator
  class) all live in `Generators/<Name>Generator.cs`. Changing what the gadget
  emits must mean changing one file.
- Never put them in a helper, and never create a shared "payload builder" for
  several gadgets. A helper may only hold mechanics that name no gadget, taking
  the names and shapes as arguments: the type-name swaps
  (`MessagePackTypelessTypeSwap`, `SharpSerializerTypeSwap`), `SerializersHelper`,
  the minifiers, the escapers.
- Reuse the base class instead of copying plumbing:
  `GenericGenerator.Serialize` for BinaryFormatter / SoapFormatter /
  NetDataContractSerializer / LosFormatter, and
  `GenericGenerator.HandWritten.cs` for a hand written document or your own bytes
  (`FinishHandWrittenPayload` covers minify plus the `-t` self-test, and
  `RequireCommandInput`, `RawInputOption`, `EscapeForJson`,
  `EscapeForXmlAttribute`, `IsFormatter`, `IsMessagePackTypeless`,
  `IsMessagePackLz4`, `UnsupportedFormatter` cover the rest). If one of those is
  genuinely wrong for this gadget, improve the shared member; do not fork it.
- The only allowed dependency on another gadget is reusing it as the INNER
  payload through `GenerateInner`, declared with `GadgetTags.Bridged` or
  `GadgetTags.Hosted`.
- Test what generation cannot prove. A bait-and-switch payload (a surrogate plus
  a type-name swap) still generates when the swap silently fails, so assert the
  target names in the emitted bytes, as
  `MessagePackTypelessCarriesTargetTypeNames` does.

Take the operator's input as typed. Unless the user asked for validation, the only
check is "not empty" (`RequireCommandInput`): no path, URL, scheme, host, extension,
character-set, or assembly-identity check. What the value means is the TARGET's
decision, ysonet never opens or resolves it, and a refusal only blocks the research.
Teach the proven form in the option help, one line of `AdditionalInfo()`, and the
docs; use `Debugging.ShowNote` for a hint, never a refusal. Refuse only what cannot
be EMITTED. Escaping, the `--minify` corruption guard, and gadget scope are separate
and still apply. Contract: `ysonet/Generators/README.md`, "Operator input: document
it, do not police it".

Accept `-t` by default, including when the effect leaves this machine - a callout is
not damage. Refuse only when the self-test would damage or compromise the OPERATOR's
machine (destroy their data, run their code, hand their unparsed bytes to native
code), decided per VARIANT and before anything is constructed. A denial-of-service
payload never deserializes in the ysonet process: route it through
`SelfTestNeedsChildProcess` / `IsolatedSelfTest`, and refuse only where that child
cannot run it. Contract: `ysonet/Generators/README.md`, "`-t` (self-test) policy".

For a DENIAL-OF-SERVICE gadget, read `ysonet/Generators/README.md`, "Denial of
service: one facet, and everything it turns on", and follow it in full. Declaring
`PayloadKind.DenialOfService` is the single switch that arms the acknowledgement, the
bulk exclusions, the test-tier exclusions and the interactive preview, so never add a
second mechanism beside it. The parts that are NOT automatic are the ones to get
right: `-t` through a child process with `PayloadReader.CanRead` covering every
advertised formatter, one line printed before the child is terminated, never a row in
any fire list, a short `AdditionalInfo()`, and per-formatter effect evidence produced
by an operator-run harness that requires the TARGET'S OWN exception rather than
merely a dead child. The acknowledgement is required on every surface and worded for
each: the editor names the SETTING, never the command-line flag, and interactive use
must not imply it.

Write the gadget to be READ. It is research material: a human and an AI must be
able to understand the technique from this one file. Nothing is hidden and
nothing is obfuscated.

- Keep each payload a whole, readable document in a verbatim string (`@"..."`),
  with the target type names spelled out, so a reader can copy it straight into
  the testing arena (`ysonet/Helpers/TestingArena/TestingArenaHome.cs`) or a
  scratch project and have it work.
- Never obfuscate, encode, or compress a payload in source: no base64 blob or
  byte array standing in for a readable document, no string assembled from
  fragments or `char` codes, no reflection used to avoid naming a type that can be
  named, no one document split across methods. When the WIRE format genuinely
  needs encoding or compression, build it from readable source at generation time
  and state in a comment what the bytes are.
- Use the real target and member names and technique-derived variable names.
  Comment the WHY - the sink, why the property order or member set matters, the
  target-side condition, what would silently break - not the syntax.
- Prefer straightforward code over a compact trick. Reflection, dynamic code or
  metaprogramming only when the technique requires it, and then explained.
- The Release binary's string encryption (`ysonet/obfuscar.xml`) is an antivirus
  measure on one shipped executable. It never justifies writing obscure source.

Walk every fillable member `ysonet/Generators/Base/IGenerator.cs` exposes and
give each an evidence-backed value or a deliberate default. Do not leave a
member at an empty or placeholder default because it was not considered. Confirm
each against the verified evidence:

- `Name()`: derived from the class name without the `Generator` suffix; override
  only when the derived public name is wrong.
- `Generate`: the real chain for every advertised formatter.
- `Finders()`: verified original researcher names.
- `Contributors()`: this tool's implementer; omit when identical to `Finders()`.
- `Credit()`: never override; the base class composes it.
- `AdditionalInfo()`: concise purpose, target assemblies and versions, CVEs, and
  public references.
- `Labels()`: only the `GadgetTags` constants that apply (`Independent`,
  `Bridged`, `Subclass`, `Hosted`, `GetterChain`, `OnDeserialized`,
  `SecondOrderDeserialization`, `NotInGAC`, `Hidden`); never a guessed string.
- Hosted payload check (do this before writing the file). Ask: does `Generate()`
  serialize a type this generator defines (its own `*Marshal` class or a real
  framework type)? If NO, and it hands another generator's object to `Serialize()`,
  then it is a hosted payload: put the file in `Generators/HostedPayloads/`, keep the
  namespace `ysonet.Generators`, and tag it `GadgetTags.Hosted`. If YES, it stays in
  `Generators/` and must NOT carry `GadgetTags.Hosted`, even when it nests another
  gadget's payload inside its own type (that is `GadgetTags.Bridged` territory).
  Having a `Variants()` list or a `var/variant` option is irrelevant to this choice.
  See `ysonet/Generators/HostedPayloads/README.md`.
- `SupportedFormatters()`: the maximum verified union from step 6. On a gadget with
  more than one variant, annotate each token with the number of variants that
  formatter carries: `"BinaryFormatter (2)"`, and a bare name when only one variant
  supports it. The count is per formatter, so a gadget can read
  `"BinaryFormatter (3)", "SoapFormatter (2)"`. It is display-only (every consumer
  splits on the first space), and it is the only place the public catalog reveals
  that the gadget has variants at all, so a multi-variant gadget without it reads as
  single-variant. Mirror the same token in `docs/gadgets-and-plugins.md` and the
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` formatter column.
- `SupportedBridgedFormatter()` and `BridgedPayload`: only for a bridge consumer
  (step 8).
- `Options()`: every real option with clear parsing and sane defaults.
- `CommandInput()`: the real meaning of `-c`; keep the `ShellCommand` default
  only when evidence proves it.
- `Variants()`: distinct payload shapes with `.Without(...)`, `.Input`, and
  `.WithFacets(...)` as needed (step 7).
- `Facets()`: the broad discovery axes derived in step 4.

- Honor `inputArgs.Minify` and `inputArgs.Test` on every advertised path.
- Return the output shape the formatter uses, normally `byte[]` for the base
  binary serializers and `string` for text serializers.
- Throw a clear exception on bad input. Never call `Environment.Exit`.
- Keep target dependencies separate from dependencies used only to generate the
  payload.

Run a focused generation check before registration. If the real branch is not
ready, use the integrity gate and leave it unregistered.

### 6. Expand formatter support systematically

Follow `references/formatter-expansion.md` in full. Build the candidate set
from current source rather than from memory: `Formatters`, every live
`SupportedFormatters()` declaration, all `SerializersHelper` partials, and
dedicated or inline serializer implementations. The public set is currently
broader than either the constants or `SerializersHelper.ShowAll()`.

Perform this audit even when the request or an implementation plan names no
additional formatter, lists only one formatter, or omits serializer work
entirely. Plan silence does not authorize a narrow implementation.

Attempt every plausible candidate against the named technique. Try the real
graph first, then a serializer-specific representation of that same chain when
the serializer needs a different shape. Compare the closest working generator
before concluding that a direct serialization failure is fundamental.

Maintain an evidence matrix with `supported`, `proven impossible`,
`product-excluded`, or `not yet proven` for every formatter and variant. Do not
stop after the first working formatter. Advertise only supported cells; an
exploration helper printing output is not proof. If investigation is blocked,
report the unproven cells and the next experiment instead of calling them
impossible.

### 7. Handle variants correctly

`SupportedFormatters()` is the gadget-wide union. For a formatter that only one
variant cannot produce:

1. add `.Without(Formatters.X)` to that `GadgetVariant`;
2. call `GuardVariantFormatter(variant_number, formatter)` near the start of
   `Generate()`; and
3. add or update the expected-failure assertion in the full matrix when the
   limitation is fundamental.

Use `GadgetVariant.Input` and `.WithFacets(...)` when a variant's input or
capability differs. Do not combine facts from different variants.

### 8. Handle bridge consumers correctly

A gadget is a bridge consumer only when it can wrap another gadget's serialized
payload. Define all of these together:

- include `GadgetTags.Bridged` in `Labels()`;
- return the one accepted inner formatter from
  `SupportedBridgedFormatter()`; and
- consume `BridgedPayload` when it is set, otherwise build the gadget's genuine
  default inner payload.

Confirm the incoming runtime type from the producer's real return value instead
of assuming it. `PayloadRunner.GenerateGadget` serializes each producer in the
next consumer's bridged formatter and passes the result forward.

### 9. Register only after the gate passes

Add the new generator source to the old-style `ysonet/ysonet.csproj`
`<Compile>` items only after a real branch generates. Match the path form used
by the surrounding MSBuild entries; use forward slashes for documentation
references.

Discovery is reflection-based, but an unlisted source file is not compiled.

### 10. Add complete coverage

Read the current test helpers and the nearest comparable gadget tests before
editing `ysonet.Tests/Tests.cs`.

- `EveryGadgetGeneratesAPayload` automatically checks the first formatter in
  the normal tier.
- `GadgetFullMatrixGenerates` automatically covers every advertised formatter,
  variant, and minify state. Add a stable expected-failure assertion only for a
  proven impossible cell.
- Prove each advertised formatter with its actual deserializer and a safe
  assertion. Do not rely on `ShowAll`, `TestAll`, or a caught `inputArgs.Test`
  exception as the sole evidence that the named chain survives round-trip.
- Add the gadget's observable runtime effect to
  `PayloadsFireIntoTestSinks`, using a marker file, loopback listener, temp
  directory, self-closing C# fixture, or another test-owned sink.
- Add focused assertions for new option parsing, command input, variant
  behavior, bridge behavior, minification, exact output, or error handling that
  the matrices do not prove.
- For a bridge consumer, automatic chain generation covers only a representative
  output formatter. Add focused end-to-end firing and any formatter-specific
  bridge coverage needed by the new behavior.
- Follow `.claude/memory/testing.md` for file locations and antivirus resilience.
  Reuse the repository's current test-artifact helpers rather than hardcoding a
  temp or machine path.

A TODO comment or empty test stub is not coverage. If a runtime effect truly
cannot be exercised on the current machine, assert the expected limitation or
use a capability-gated test with a clear reason, following the existing suite.

### 11. Audit metadata and public surfaces

Use `$ysonet-audit-gadget-metadata` after implementation. If named-skill
invocation is not available, read and follow
`.claude/skills/ysonet-audit-gadget-metadata/SKILL.md` directly. Fix
evidence-backed drift across facets, variants, labels, help, tests, and
documentation.

Update:

- the gadget table and related counts/details in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`;
- `docs/gadgets-and-plugins.md`; and
- credits or reference documentation when the new technique adds entries there.

Do not document an unregistered draft as supported.

### 12. Verify in a loop

Keep the first test loop specific to the gadget. Restore and compile without
starting the post-build runner:

```text
nuget restore ysonet.sln
msbuild ysonet.sln -p:Configuration=Debug -p:RunYsonetTests=false -v:minimal -nologo
```

Run only the new gadget's focused generation/deserialization assertions,
affected formatter/variant/option/minify/error cases, and safe runtime-effect
trigger. Fix root causes and repeat this narrow set until the real payload
triggers and every gadget-specific check passes. During that focused gate,
smoke:

- `ysonet/bin/Debug/ysonet.exe --list gadgets`;
- `ysonet/bin/Debug/ysonet.exe --list formatters -g <Name>`;
- one real generation for every materially different branch; and
- the interactive module editor entry and category result.

If the gadget's only runtime effect is an outbound UNC/SMB callback, it needs the
opt-in OOB tier, and an automated run never touches a UNC path on the public
endpoint. Use the maintainer's self-hosted interactsh server when they have one.
When they do not, STOP AND ASK before the first UNC touch: state that the touch
goes to a public third-party endpoint and that Windows sends authentication
material when it opens the SMB session, then let them decide. Their explicit
approval covers only the runs discussed and only this gadget. Never point
`YSONET_INTERACTSH_SERVER` at a public endpoint yourself to make the gate pass.
Without approval the check stays a named skip and the runtime effect is reported
as UNVERIFIED; do not call the gadget finished on generation evidence alone.

Only after that gate is green, run the normal Debug tests and then the FULL
suite as the final regression gate:

```text
msbuild ysonet.sln -p:Configuration=Debug -v:minimal -nologo
cd ysonet/bin/Debug
ysonet.Tests.exe --full
```

Run the standalone executable from its output directory so bundled assemblies
resolve. If that route is not suitable, set `YSONET_FULL_TESTS=1` for the final
Debug build. If FULL exposes an issue, fix it, rerun the affected focused
checks, and repeat the final regression gate. The final tested source state must
end with a green FULL run.

Report any environment-specific skip or blocker honestly.

## Final checks

- [ ] The technique and credits are supported by evidence.
- [ ] No existing gadget already covers the same behavior without approval.
- [ ] Every live serializer family was considered and every plausible candidate
      has an evidence-backed status for each variant.
- [ ] Every advertised formatter and variant builds the named real chain.
- [ ] Every fillable `IGenerator` member (name, finders, contributors,
      additional info, labels, supported formatters, options, command input,
      variants, facets, and bridge members) has an evidence-backed value or an
      intentional default; none left at an unconsidered empty placeholder.
- [ ] Facets, command input, labels, variants, and target requirements agree.
- [ ] Every runtime-gated gadget or variant names at least one verified working
      version. If latest failed, the highest verified working version is the
      ceiling and the latest tested non-working version is documented.
- [ ] `WithVersions` uses a single token for one established version or an
      evidence-backed contiguous range, repeated in every variant override; a
      non-runtime gate is deliberately left `unspecified` and documented.
- [ ] Bridge metadata and `BridgedPayload` behavior are complete when applicable.
- [ ] The old-style csproj entry is present only for the finished source.
- [ ] Focused generation, deserialization, behavior, and runtime-effect coverage passed first.
- [ ] Public catalogs and help surfaces include the finished gadget.
- [ ] Reflection and interactive smokes passed before the repository regression gate.
- [ ] Debug tests passed and the final tested source state ends with a green FULL run.
- [ ] No test was weakened, no fake placeholder was registered, and no version,
      commit, or push action was taken without the required approval.
