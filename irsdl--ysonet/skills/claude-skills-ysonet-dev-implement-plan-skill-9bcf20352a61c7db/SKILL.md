# Implement a ysonet development plan

Turn an approved plan into working, tested code. The implementation is the
deliverable. A plan is guidance, not authority to weaken repository rules,
change `VERSION`, commit, push, or overwrite unrelated work.

Plans normally move through:

- `dev-kitchen/ideas/`: draft;
- `dev-kitchen/to-be-implemented/`: settled and approved; and
- `dev-kitchen/already-implemented/`: optional post-delivery record.

## Quality bar

Quality comes before finishing fast. Done means right, not "the plan's boxes
are ticked".

- Build the durable solution. When a better approach lasts longer and makes the
  app easier to extend, take it, even when it is more work.
- Fix root causes. A hack, a special case, a copy-paste, or a "for now" patch
  is acceptable only when a hard constraint blocks the proper fix, and then it
  needs a `dev-kitchen/todo/` note stating the proper fix.
- Deliver the complete change: implementation, every applicable serializer and
  formatter, tests, docs, help, completion, interactive UI, and architecture
  updates. A partly wired feature is not delivered.
- Use existing shared patterns and helpers. If the shared pattern is genuinely
  wrong for the job, improve it rather than working around it.
- Never trade correctness or test integrity for a green tick or a faster
  finish.
- A plan is not authority to cut corners. Silence in the plan about serializer
  coverage, tests, docs, or public surfaces means do the complete work, not
  skip it. If the quality option needs extra scope or a maintainer decision,
  treat it as a material deviation under step 4 and ask.

## Workflow

### 1. Select the approved plan

Look in `dev-kitchen/to-be-implemented/`.

- Use the plan the user names.
- If there is one plan and the request is unambiguous, use it.
- If several plans could match, ask which one.
- If no settled plan exists, report that. Use a draft from `ideas/` only after
  the user explicitly approves that draft for implementation.

Read the whole plan before editing.

### 2. Load repository state

Read `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/memory/memory.md` and every indexed memory file,
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and the complete files in scope.

Inspect:

- `git status --short` and the relevant diff;
- current project and dependency files;
- tests and public surfaces named by the plan; and
- any user changes that overlap the same files.

Preserve unrelated edits. Do not switch branches, create a worktree, stage
files, or discard changes unless the user requested that workflow.

### 3. Re-ground the plan

Verify every load-bearing claim against current source:

- files, symbols, namespaces, and call paths still exist;
- old-style csproj entries match additions and moves;
- reflection and string-based type-name paths remain valid;
- CLI, interactive, help, completion, and docs impacts are complete;
- tests still use the patterns the plan expects;
- dependencies satisfy freshness and pinning policy; and
- no newer code already solves or conflicts with a planned step.

Treat source as authoritative when a plan or architecture note has drifted.

When a code-graph tool and a graph are configured in this workspace:

1. read that tool's own skill or documentation in full before using it;
2. confirm the graph root, dependencies, and file scope before relying on it;
3. query it for relevant call paths, containment, inheritance, attributes,
   overrides, source-to-sink reachability, and blast radius; and
4. for gadget work, investigate serializer target shapes, magic members,
   bridges, and paths to the named sink.

Never read or grep a large graph file directly, and never query its index
outside the tool that owns it. Do not copy a machine-local graph path into
tracked files. Treat graph results as scoped supporting evidence: verify current
code with source and tests, use `rg` for strings, configuration, docs, and
ungraphed code, and do not claim that a graph proves post-edit behavior unless
its source graph was regenerated. No such tool is required: when none is
configured, continue with source inspection without blocking.

### 4. Resolve only material deviations

Classify differences before coding:

- Apply a small, reversible, intent-preserving correction and record it in the
  plan.
- Stop and ask when a difference changes scope, public behavior,
  compatibility, security, data handling, dependencies, or the selected design.
- Do not silently substitute a workaround for a planned proper solution.

Update the plan with each material approved deviation and its reason. Clear
open material decisions before implementation; make and record reasonable
assumptions for minor details.

### 5. Track and implement the work

Create a current task plan and work through it in dependency order. Keep one
step active at a time. The implementation must cover the complete current
contract, even when the older plan missed a necessary test or public surface.

Hold every edit to these rules:

- keep all solution projects on .NET Framework 4.7.2 unless the user approved a
  target change;
- update old-style csproj includes for every added, moved, or removed source;
- preserve reflection and name-based behavior;
- follow dependency freshness and GitHub Actions SHA-pinning policies;
- keep intentionally vulnerable gadget libraries at their required versions;
- use repository-relative paths and no local or sensitive artifacts;
- use short plain ASCII text in docs, comments, and help;
- never weaken a test to get green;
- never call `Environment.Exit` from reusable gadget/plugin paths; and
- do not edit `VERSION`, commit, or push without the separate approvals required
  by `CLAUDE.md`.

For a new or changed gadget, use `$ysonet-dev-create-gadget` as the complete
gadget implementation contract. If named-skill invocation is unavailable, read
`.claude/skills/ysonet-dev-create-gadget/SKILL.md` in full and follow every
reference and asset it requires. This skill still controls approved-plan
selection, material deviations, and plan disposition; the create-gadget skill
controls gadget integrity, evidence, formatter expansion, implementation,
registration, coverage, metadata, docs, and smokes.

The create-gadget contract is mandatory even when the approved plan omits
serializer work, names only one formatter, or assumes a narrow set. Plan silence
is not authority to skip it. This includes filling every fillable member
`ysonet/Generators/Base/IGenerator.cs` exposes with an evidence-backed value or
an intentional default: name, finders, contributors, additional info, labels
(only `GadgetTags` constants), supported formatters, options, command input,
variants, facets, and the bridge members. A plan that lists only a formatter or
a technique does not license leaving labels or other metadata at an empty
placeholder.

That includes the runtime version axis. Every .NET Framework gadget plan and
finished implementation must name at least one evidence-backed working target version.
First identify whether the number describes the framework the target process
runs on or, for a compile-time compatibility gate, the target application's
`TargetFrameworkAttribute`; it never describes ysonet's own build.
Test the current/latest candidate first. After a successful FULL run, read its
`Runtime:` line and the version report at the end of the execution matrix: a
gadget that fired but declares no version is listed there by name. If the latest
candidate does not fire and runtime compatibility is the gate, reproduce the
effect on older supported target versions and use the highest verified working
version as the ceiling; never assign the failed latest version. Also record the
latest tested non-working version in the gadget documentation or
`AdditionalInfo()`.

Use one runtime token when only one target version is established. Use
`.WithVersions(RuntimeVersion.Range(floor, ceiling))` only when evidence supports
the contiguous span, with the documented type-introduction version as the floor
(default `NetFx40`, `NetFx45` for the claims/WIF/`Comparer<T>.Create` families).
Repeat the declaration in every variant `FacetOverride`, and leave
`unspecified` only when the real gate is not a runtime version. If a runtime-gated
plan has no known working version, that is a material plan gap: stop and return
it for evidence instead of guessing or declaring the implementation complete. A
plan that says nothing about versions is not authority to skip this. Additional
branches that use existing
dependencies, targets, and public formatter tokens are required completion
work, not a material deviation. If support requires an unapproved dependency,
target change, new public formatter token, or different gadget technique, treat
that as a material deviation under step 4. Use `$ysonet-categorize-gadget` plus
`$ysonet-audit-gadget-metadata`. For a new or changed plugin, read
`.claude/skills/ysonet-dev-create-plan/references/making-a-plugin.md` in full.
Re-check uniqueness before adding either. If either companion named-skill
invocation is unavailable, read and follow its `SKILL.md` under
`.claude/skills/` directly.

### 6. Add complete tests

Implement every planned regression test and any additional case required by
the current code. Follow the nearest existing test style.

For gadgets:

- normal and full generation matrices cover advertised combinations;
- each advertised formatter has focused deserialization evidence beyond
  exploration helpers or swallowed `inputArgs.Test` errors;
- add the real runtime effect to `PayloadsFireIntoTestSinks`;
- add focused input, option, variant, bridge, minify, exact-output, and error
  coverage where relevant; and
- assert known impossible combinations as expected failures.

For plugins:

- classify the plugin in `EverySafePluginGeneratesAPayload`;
- add every mode, CVE, and material inner path to
  `PluginFullMatrixGenerates`;
- test repeated in-process state and `IPluginModes` metadata; and
- add safe runtime-effect coverage when observable.

For all new functions, test normal behavior, important boundaries, and error
behavior. A TODO or empty test stub is not coverage.

Tests that write files follow `.claude/memory/testing.md`, use the repository's
current test-artifact helpers, verify artifacts survive, and clean up in
`finally`.

For a gadget or plugin, run this coverage in the order required by the
repository: first run only the changed module's focused tests and safe
runtime-effect trigger. Keep that loop narrow until the module generates,
deserializes, triggers as intended, and all of its focused assertions pass.
Only then run repository-wide regression tests in step 8.

### 7. Update docs and public surfaces

Apply the plan's documentation work and any newly discovered required updates:

- update the relevant `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` sections and keep its
  `Last reviewed` value consistent with the current `VERSION`;
- update catalog, usage, credit, and reference pages;
- update normal CLI, interactive UI, help, completion, and listings together;
  and
- keep private `dev-kitchen/`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `.claude/` notes out of public
  architecture prose.

Do not bump `VERSION` merely because documentation changed.

### 8. Verify and fix root causes

Use two verification gates for gadget/plugin work. Do not start with the
automatic NORMAL tier or the FULL suite.

First restore and compile without starting the post-build runner:

```text
nuget restore ysonet.sln
msbuild ysonet.sln -p:Configuration=Debug -p:RunYsonetTests=false -v:minimal -nologo
```

Then run the plan's exact FOCUSED checks for the changed gadget or plugin only.
Cover its generation, real deserializer paths, affected
formatter/variant/mode/option/minify/error branches, and its safe runtime effect.
Repeat only this focused set while fixing it. Do not treat a broad generation
matrix as trigger evidence.

Smoke every changed runtime surface during this focused gate. Common checks
include:

- `ysonet/bin/Debug/ysonet.exe --list gadgets`;
- `ysonet/bin/Debug/ysonet.exe --list plugins`;
- module-specific formatter and option listings;
- category and help output;
- interactive navigation; and
- one representative real payload per materially different branch.

If the changed gadget or plugin's only runtime effect is an outbound UNC/SMB
callback, it needs the opt-in OOB tier, and an automated run never touches a UNC
path on the public endpoint. Use the maintainer's self-hosted interactsh server
when they have one. When they do not, STOP AND ASK before the first UNC touch:
state that the touch goes to a public third-party endpoint and that Windows sends
authentication material when it opens the SMB session, then let them decide. Their
explicit approval covers only the runs discussed and only this module. Never point
`YSONET_INTERACTSH_SERVER` at a public endpoint yourself to make the gate pass.
Without approval the check stays a named skip and the effect is reported as
UNVERIFIED; do not report the plan step as done on generation evidence alone.

Run a Release build here when the plan changes packaging, build configuration,
release output, or names it as a required check.

Only after the focused gate is green, run the repository regression gate from
the repository root:

```text
msbuild ysonet.sln -p:Configuration=Debug -v:minimal -nologo
```

That Debug build runs the normal tier. Then run the FULL suite LAST for any
gadget, plugin, serializer, formatter, minifier, or cross-cutting payload
change:

```text
cd ysonet/bin/Debug
ysonet.Tests.exe --full
```

Run the standalone executable from its output directory so bundled assemblies
resolve. Alternatively set `YSONET_FULL_TESTS=1` for the final Debug build.
When any final-regression failure needs a fix, return to the affected focused
checks, repeat the normal tier, and rerun FULL. The final tested source state
must end with a green FULL run.

Report command output honestly. Read the `ENVIRONMENT VERDICT:` line printed just
above the Passed/Failed summary BEFORE you attribute any failure to product code:

- `clean` or `environment-limited`: any failure is ordinary work. Fix the root
  cause. An `environment-limited` run also means checks did not run, so say which
  ones were skipped rather than calling the coverage complete.
- `environment-suspect` or `mixed`: at least one check reached its network action
  with the capability available and still missed the effect. Report the capability
  evidence from the report and ASK the maintainer how to proceed. Do not edit
  product code or loosen an assertion over an environmental failure. Ordinary
  failures in the same run stay actionable as usual.

A skipped check is unverified, never passed. Then rerun the affected checks. If
the required fix changes the design, return to step 4.

### 9. Review the final change

Before handoff:

- run `git diff --check`;
- inspect `git status --short` and the complete relevant diff;
- scan added lines for absolute local paths, secrets, build output, temp files,
  and unintended generated artifacts;
- confirm no unrelated user edit was overwritten;
- confirm the plan and implementation still agree; and
- rerun focused validation after any review fix.

Do not stage or commit by default. If the user explicitly asks for a commit,
request any approval still required by `CLAUDE.md`, make one coherent commit,
and never push.

### 10. Hand off the plan and follow-ups

Report changed files, tests, smoke results, deviations, and any environmental
limitations.

Never decide the plan file's fate alone. Ask the user with AskUserQuestion and
offer these options:

- move it to `dev-kitchen/already-implemented/` (keeps the record);
- delete it (the work is done and the file has no further value); and
- leave it in `dev-kitchen/to-be-implemented/` (delivery is partial, or more
  work follows).

Recommend moving for complex, rollback-sensitive, or reusable plans. Do the
chosen action yourself, then say where the file ended up. If the user does not
answer, leave the file where it is.

For every unresolved decision, known limitation, or follow-up, create or update
one short file under `dev-kitchen/todo/` and its `README.md` index. Include the
decision, concise options, recommendation, and code/test references. Call these
out in the final handoff.

## Final checks

- [ ] An approved plan was selected and read in full.
- [ ] Repository guidance, memory, source, tests, and working-tree state were read.
- [ ] Any configured code-graph database was scoped before use and queried for the
      task; source covered unavailable or ungraphed areas.
- [ ] Plan claims were re-verified against current code.
- [ ] Material deviations were approved and recorded; minor corrections preserve intent.
- [ ] Every implementation, csproj, public-surface, and documentation step is complete.
- [ ] Gadget work considered every plausible serializer and implemented the
      maximum verified formatter set even when the plan omitted that work.
- [ ] New or changed gadgets followed the complete create-gadget skill.
- [ ] New functions and behavior have focused and matrix/runtime coverage as applicable.
- [ ] Gadget/plugin focused tests and runtime trigger passed before any repository-wide suite.
- [ ] Smokes and optional Release checks passed before the final regression gate.
- [ ] Debug tests passed and the final tested source state ends with a green FULL run.
- [ ] Final diff and artifact scans are clean; unrelated user work is preserved.
- [ ] `VERSION` was not changed and no commit or push occurred without approval.
- [ ] Plan disposition (move, delete, or leave) was asked as explicit options,
      the user's choice was applied, and every remaining item is in `dev-kitchen/todo/`.
