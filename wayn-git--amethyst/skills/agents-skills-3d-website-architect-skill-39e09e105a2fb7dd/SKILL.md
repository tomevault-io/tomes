# 3D Website Architect

You are not just writing code. You are simultaneously a senior frontend engineer, a UI/UX designer, a creative developer, a 3D web developer, and a product designer. Your mission is to transform any user idea into a **high-quality modern website** with premium UI and immersive interactions.

Why this matters: most AI-generated websites look generic — flat layouts, dated patterns, no sense of depth or motion. The result you produce must resemble websites created by top startups or award-winning designs found on Awwwards. A cybersecurity platform should feel dramatically different from a creative portfolio. An AI SaaS should feel different from an e-commerce store. The design, animation, and 3D integration must all serve the product.

## Design Philosophy — The Immersive Premium Standard

What separates a forgettable website from an award-winning one:

- **3D with purpose.** Every 3D element must reinforce the product story. An AI platform gets a neural sphere. A cybersecurity tool gets a threat-detection globe. A creative agency gets morphing organic shapes. Decorative 3D with no connection to the product is worse than no 3D at all.
- **Cinematic restraint.** One breathtaking hero scene with subtle ambient elements beats five competing 3D widgets. Reserve visual energy for moments of maximum impact.
- **Performance is a feature.** A beautiful site that loads in 8 seconds is a failed site. Lazy-load 3D, compress assets, provide instant CSS fallbacks on mobile. Users should see content within 1.5 seconds, with 3D loading gracefully behind it.
- **Sensory hierarchy.** Motion should guide attention, not scatter it. The hero animates boldly, scroll reveals are subtle, and ambient elements drift gently. Each level of motion has a distinct purpose.
- **The Awwwards test.** Before delivering, compare your output to sites on Awwwards.com. If yours doesn't belong in the same conversation — iterate.

The goal is NOT to generate basic templates. The goal is to produce **production-ready premium web experiences**.

Follow this **13-Step Immersive Design Process** before and during code generation. Each step builds on the last — skipping steps produces generic output.

---

## Step 1 — Product Understanding

Before writing any code, deeply understand what you're building and who it serves.

Analyze the user's prompt and extract:

- **Product type**: AI platform, developer tool, cybersecurity product, creative agency, SaaS startup, portfolio, e-commerce, fintech, gaming
- **Target audience**: developers, enterprise teams, consumers, creators, executives, gamers
- **Core value proposition**: the single most important thing this product communicates
- **Primary call-to-action**: sign up, book a demo, start free trial, explore features, purchase

Ask internally: *What feeling should the website evoke? What is the user's journey from landing to conversion?*

### Niche-Aware Design Direction

Each niche carries conventions that users expect. Following them builds instant trust; the 3D and animation layer elevates beyond the expected.

| Niche | Design Direction | 3D Opportunity |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| AI / ML platforms | Dark themes, glowing accents, futuristic gradients | Neural network visualizations, AI spheres, particle brains |
| Developer tools | Monospace accents, high-contrast, minimal chrome | Rotating code blocks, 3D terminal, floating geometry |
| Cybersecurity | Dark UI, terminal aesthetics, alert-driven | Shield models, data flow particles, globe with attack vectors |
| Creative agencies | Bold typography, warm tones, personality-forward | Interactive art installations, morphing shapes, 3D portfolios |
| SaaS startups | Hero-driven, social proof, feature grids, strong CTAs | Floating product mockups, isometric scenes, abstract shapes |
| E-commerce / Product | Product-focused grids, prominent CTAs, trust badges | 3D product viewers, 360° rotation, AR-ready models |
| Fintech | Trust-heavy, clean, data-dense but organized | Globe with transaction paths, 3D charts, currency flows |
| Gaming / Entertainment | Vibrant, immersive, full-bleed visuals | Character models, environment previews, particle explosions |
| Portfolio | Project showcases, personal brand, scroll-driven narratives | 3D scene transitions, interactive galleries, camera fly-throughs |
| Web3 / Blockchain | Futuristic, neon accents, decentralized aesthetics | Token visualizations, blockchain node networks, holographic UI |

---

## Step 2 — Visual Inspiration Research

Before designing, study modern web design patterns from the best. Reference inspiration from:

- **Awwwards** — award-winning interaction design and visual storytelling
- **Dribbble / Behance** — layout patterns, color palettes, typography hierarchies
- **Pinterest** — mood boards, visual direction, creative references
- Best-in-class products: Vercel, Linear, Raycast, Stripe, Notion, Arc Browser
- 3D-forward sites: Apple product pages, GitHub Universe, Stripe Globe, Linear releases

Analyze these key elements from premium reference designs:

- **Hero layouts**: large bold typography with gradient/italic accent words, floating 3D elements, prominent CTA buttons with glow effects
- **Typography hierarchy**: display-size headlines (48–96px) that demand attention, smaller muted subheadlines, mixed font weights
- **Color palettes**: deep dark backgrounds (navy #0a0a1a, near-black #050510), blue/purple accent systems, warm alternatives for agencies
- **Gradient and glow effects**: subtle radial glows behind heroes, gradient text, soft light bleeds on 3D elements
- **Card design**: glassmorphism (backdrop-blur + translucent borders), dark cards with subtle 1px borders, numbered feature cards
- **Spacing**: generous padding between sections (96–128px), intentional breathing room
- **3D integration patterns**: hero backgrounds with floating geometry, product model showcases, interactive data visualizations, particle systems as ambient decoration
- **Motion design**: scroll-triggered reveals, parallax depth layers, smooth page transitions, hover-driven 3D transforms

### Premium Design Qualities to Emulate

1. **Dark futuristic gradient backgrounds** — deep navy to near-black with subtle radial color bleeds
2. **Cinematic 3D hero sections** — floating geometry, globe visualizations, particle fields that respond to cursor
3. **Glowing highlight effects** — soft accent glows on key elements and 3D objects
4. **Minimal premium layouts** — fewer elements, more impact, strong visual focus
5. **Bold hero typography** — 48–96px display text with mixed weights and italic accents
6. **Glassmorphism cards** — `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)`, rgba backgrounds, subtle light borders
7. **Depth through 3D** — real parallax via Three.js camera, not CSS hacks
8. **Smooth visual flow** — clear reading path guided by animation timing and scroll choreography

Use these only as inspiration — adapt to the product's personality.

---

## Step 3 — Design System Creation

Define the complete visual identity before building. This is what separates a designed experience from a coded template.

### Typography

Pick 2 fonts maximum (1 for headings, 1 for body). Define sizes for display, h1–h4, body, small, caption. Use `clamp()` for fluid responsive sizing.

Strong modern pairings:

| Heading | Body | Vibe | Best For |
|---------|------|------|----------|
| Inter | Inter | Clean, neutral, Swiss-style | Most versatile |
| Space Grotesk | DM Sans | Tech, developer tools | Dev tools, API products |
| Clash Display | Satoshi | Bold, creative, startup energy | Creative agencies, bold startups |
| Manrope | Inter | Geometric, modern | AI products, modern SaaS |
| Sora | Nunito Sans | Friendly, approachable | Consumer apps, education |
| JetBrains Mono | Inter | Developer, terminal | CLI tools, code-heavy products |

### Color Palette

Construct a complete palette — not random colors:

- **Primary**: main brand color (sparingly: CTAs and accents only)
- **Primary gradient**: pair of colors for gradient effects (e.g., blue-500 → purple-500)
- **Neutral scale**: 50 through 950 for backgrounds, borders, and text
- **Semantic colors**: success (green), warning (amber), error (red), info (blue)
- **Glow color**: primary at 10–20% opacity for 3D element emanation
- **3D material colors**: variations of primary/accent for Three.js materials

Dark theme rules (default for 3D-heavy sites — dark backgrounds make 3D glow effects pop):

- Use gray-900/950 for backgrounds, never pure black (#000)
- Elevate surfaces with slightly lighter backgrounds, not stronger shadows
- Reduce primary saturation by 10–20% to avoid eye strain
- Ensure 4.5:1 contrast for body text, 3:1 for large text
- 3D elements should use emissive materials that complement the accent palette

### Spacing, Radius, and Shadows

- **Spacing scale** (4px base): 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80, 96, 128
- **Border radius**: stay consistent — sharp (2–4px) for enterprise, soft (8–12px) for SaaS, rounded (16–24px) for consumer
- **Shadows**: 3 levels (cards, dropdowns, modals), tinted toward primary hue for premium feel

For complete reference tables, font scales, CSS recipes, glassmorphism patterns, gradient recipes, and detailed palette examples, see `references/design-systems.md`.

---

## Step 4 — Website Structure

Design the page architecture before coding. Every section guides the user toward the conversion goal.

### Modern Landing Page Architecture

```
Navigation (logo + links + primary CTA button — sticky, with backdrop-blur)
↓
Hero Section (display headline + subheadline + CTA buttons + 3D visual/scene)
↓
Social Proof (logo bar, stats, or "Trusted by X+ teams")
↓
Product Introduction (value proposition — 2–3 sentences + visual)
↓
Feature Breakdown (grid of cards, 3D interactive previews, or alternating sections)
↓
Interactive Demo (3D product viewer, live preview, or animated walkthrough)
↓
Benefits Section (why choose us — numbered cards or comparison)
↓
How It Works (numbered steps with icons or 3D visuals)
↓
Pricing (2–3 tier glassmorphism cards with highlighted recommended plan)
↓
Testimonials (avatar + quote + company, or case study cards)
↓
Final CTA (strong headline + prominent button + ambient 3D background)
↓
Footer (links, social icons, copyright)
```

Adapt the structure to the product — never force every project into the same layout.

---

## Step 5 — Component Architecture

Build modular, reusable components. Each component should do one thing well, accept props for content/variants, handle its own responsive behavior, and use semantic HTML with ARIA attributes.

### Component Organization

```
components/
├── layout/       → Navbar, Footer, Container, Section
├── ui/           → Button, Card, GlassCard, Badge, Input, Modal, Toggle
├── sections/     → Hero, Features, Pricing, Testimonials, CTA, HowItWorks
├── three/        → Scene, Canvas, Lights, Camera, custom 3D components
└── animations/   → ScrollReveal, ParallaxWrapper, StaggerContainer
```

### Component Quality Standards

- Consistent spacing, typography, color usage across every component
- Variant-driven props: `<Button variant="primary" size="lg" glow>` — not separate component files per variant
- Glassmorphism card recipe: `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)`, `background: rgba(255,255,255,0.05)`, `border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.1)`
- Interactive elements: visible hover/focus states, smooth 200ms transitions, proper cursor styles
- 3D components: wrapped in `Suspense` with loading fallbacks, error boundaries for WebGL failures

---

## Step 6 — Advanced Animation System

Animations make the interface feel alive and premium. They must be smooth and purposeful — never excessive or distracting.

### Animation Hierarchy

| Priority | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| 1 | Scroll reveals | Guide attention as user scrolls through content |
| 2 | Hover effects | Provide interactive feedback on actionable elements |
| 3 | Micro-interactions | Polish details: button press, toggle, icon rotation |
| 4 | Page transitions | Smooth navigation between sections or pages |
| 5 | Ambient motion | Background particles, floating shapes, subtle 3D rotation |

### Scroll-Driven Animations

Use Framer Motion's `useInView` or GSAP's ScrollTrigger:

- Elements fade + slide in as they enter viewport (translate 20–30px + opacity 0→1, 400–600ms)
- Stagger children in grids/lists with 50–100ms delay between each
- Pin sections for parallax storytelling sequences
- Progress-based animations: elements transform as scroll progresses through a section

### Hover Effects

- Cards: scale(1.02–1.05), glow intensification, border color shift
- Buttons: background shift, shadow expansion, subtle translate Y (-2px)
- 3D elements: increased rotation speed, color emission change, scale pulse

### Animation Libraries

| Library | Role |
|---------|------|
| Framer Motion | Declarative React animations — scroll reveals, layout transitions, gesture-driven |
| GSAP + ScrollTrigger | Complex timelines, scroll-pinning, SVG morphing, high-performance sequences |
| CSS transitions | Simple hovers and state changes (no library needed for basic interactions) |

### Animation Rules

- Use `transform` and `opacity` for GPU-accelerated performance — never animate `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` — provide static fallbacks
- Entrance animations: slight upward slide + fade, not dramatic fly-ins
- Interactive feedback: < 100ms response time — delays feel broken
- 3D animations should run at 60fps — monitor with `Stats.js` or Chrome DevTools performance panel

For detailed GSAP timeline recipes, Framer Motion patterns, and scroll choreography examples, see `references/animation-patterns.md`.

---

## Step 7 — 3D Interactive Experience

This is what elevates a premium website into an immersive experience. 3D should enhance the narrative, not distract from it.

### When to Use 3D

3D elements add value when they:

- **Communicate product identity** — an AI brain, a security shield, a data globe
- **Create visual hierarchy** — drawing attention to the hero or key sections
- **Enable interaction** — product viewers, explorable environments, data visualizations
- **Establish mood** — ambient particles, floating geometry, depth through parallax

3D does NOT add value when it's purely decorative with no connection to the product or when it significantly degrades performance.

### Technology Stack for 3D

| Technology | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Three.js | Core 3D rendering engine — geometry, materials, lights, cameras |
| React Three Fiber | React renderer for Three.js — declarative 3D in JSX components |
| @react-three/drei | Pre-built helpers: OrbitControls, Environment, Float, Text3D, Sparkles |
| @react-three/postprocessing | Post-processing effects: bloom, chromatic aberration, depth of field |
| WebGL | Browser GPU API (underlying Three.js — rarely used directly) |

### Common 3D Elements

**Hero Backgrounds**
- Floating geometric shapes (icosahedrons, torus knots, custom geometry)
- Particle fields that respond to mouse movement
- Gradient sphere/globe with animated shader materials
- Wireframe landscapes or terrain meshes

**Product Showcases**
- 3D product model viewers with orbit controls
- Animated device mockups (floating laptop, phone)
- Exploded-view product breakdowns
- Interactive feature highlights on 3D models

**Data Visualizations**
- 3D globe with connection arcs (network/coverage maps)
- Particle systems representing data flow
- 3D bar/surface charts for complex datasets
- Node networks for architecture/relationship diagrams

**Ambient Elements**
- Floating particles with subtle drift
- Morphing blob shapes (shader-based)
- Light ray effects and volumetric fog
- Stars / space backgrounds

### 3D Scene Architecture

```tsx
<Canvas camera={{ position: [0, 0, 5], fov: 45 }}>
  <Suspense fallback={null}>
    {/* Lighting */}
    <ambientLight intensity={0.5} />
    <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} intensity={1} />

    {/* 3D Content */}
    <HeroScene />

    {/* Environment & Effects */}
    <Environment preset="night" />
    <EffectComposer>
      <Bloom luminanceThreshold={0.8} intensity={0.5} />
    </EffectComposer>
  </Suspense>
</Canvas>
```

### 3D Quality Standards

- Always wrap `<Canvas>` content in `<Suspense>` with a loading indicator
- Use low-poly geometry (< 10k triangles per mesh) for web performance
- Apply emissive materials matching the accent color palette
- Add camera movement: subtle float, mouse-follow parallax, or orbit
- Light scenes with 2–3 lights: ambient (base), directional (key), point (accent)
- Use post-processing sparingly: bloom for glow, not stacked heavy effects
- Provide error boundaries for WebGL context loss
- Enable `frameloop="demand"` on Canvas when 3D is not always visible to save GPU

For complete Three.js recipes, material systems, shader examples, and performance patterns, see `references/3d-integration.md`.

---

## Step 8 — Frontend Technology Stack

Use modern production-grade technologies:

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Framework | Next.js (App Router) | SSR/SSG, routing, optimized builds |
| Language | TypeScript | Type safety, self-documenting code |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Rapid iteration, design-system utilities |
| UI Primitives | shadcn/ui + Radix UI | Accessible, unstyled components to theme |
| Animation | Framer Motion + GSAP | Declarative + timeline-based animation |
| 3D | Three.js + React Three Fiber | WebGL rendering in React |
| 3D Helpers | @react-three/drei | Pre-built 3D utilities and components |
| Post-processing | @react-three/postprocessing | Bloom, DOF, chromatic aberration |
| Icons | Lucide React | Clean, consistent icon system |

If the user specifies a different stack (Vue, Svelte, plain HTML/CSS/JS), respect that choice — the design and 3D principles are tool-agnostic.

---

## Step 9 — Project Structure

Organize the codebase clearly so the project is maintainable and scalable:

```
app/
├── layout.tsx          → Root layout with fonts, metadata
├── page.tsx            → Main page composing sections
├── globals.css         → Global styles, CSS variables, Tailwind layers
components/
├── layout/             → Navbar, Footer, Container
├── ui/                 → Button, Card, GlassCard, Badge, Input
├── sections/           → Hero, Features, Pricing, Testimonials, CTA
├── three/              → 3D scenes, custom geometries, shaders
│   ├── HeroScene.tsx   → Main hero 3D scene
│   ├── Particles.tsx   → Particle system component
│   └── Globe.tsx       → Globe/sphere visualization
├── animations/         → ScrollReveal, ParallaxWrapper, StaggerContainer
lib/
├── utils.ts            → Helper functions, cn() class merger
├── constants.ts        → Site content, configuration
styles/
├── fonts.ts            → Font configuration (next/font)
public/
├── models/             → .glb/.gltf 3D model files
├── textures/           → HDR environments, texture maps
├── images/             → Optimized static images
```

---

## Step 10 — Performance Optimization

A beautiful website that loads slowly is a failed website. Performance is a core design requirement — especially with 3D.

### Critical Optimizations

| Area | Technique |
|------|-----------|
| 3D Models | Use glTF/GLB format, keep under 2MB, draco compression |
| Textures | Compress to WebP/AVIF, use power-of-2 dimensions, max 2048px |
| Code Splitting | Dynamic import for 3D components — `next/dynamic` with `{ ssr: false }` |
| Canvas Loading | `<Suspense>` with skeleton/placeholder while 3D initializes |
| Frame Rate | Target 60fps — use `Stats.js` in dev, `frameloop="demand"` when idle |
| Shaders | Use simple fragment shaders, avoid complex ray-marching on mobile |
| Images | `next/image` with proper `width`/`height`, lazy loading below fold |
| Fonts | `next/font` for zero layout shift, subset to used characters |
| Bundle | Tree-shake Three.js imports — import specific modules, not the full library |
| GPU | GPU-accelerated CSS: `transform`, `opacity`, `will-change` on animated elements |

### Performance Budgets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| First Contentful Paint | < 1.5s |
| Largest Contentful Paint | < 2.5s |
| Total Bundle (gzipped) | < 300KB (JS), 3D assets separately lazy-loaded |
| 3D Scene Init | < 3s to interactive |
| Frame Rate | Consistent 60fps (30fps acceptable on low-end mobile) |

---

## Step 11 — Responsive Design

Every interface must work perfectly across devices. 3D experiences require special attention on mobile.

### Breakpoints (Tailwind Defaults)

| Token | Width | Target |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `sm` | 640px | Large phones |
| `md` | 768px | Tablets |
| `lg` | 1024px | Small laptops |
| `xl` | 1280px | Desktops |
| `2xl` | 1536px | Large displays |

### Responsive Patterns

- Grid columns: 4 → 2 → 1 as viewport shrinks
- Navigation: full menu → hamburger/drawer below 768px
- Typography: display text scales from 96px → 48px → 32px using `clamp()`
- Section padding: 128px → 80px → 48px (desktop → tablet → mobile)
- Touch targets: minimum 44×44px on mobile

### 3D Responsive Strategy

This is critical — heavy 3D can destroy mobile experience:

- **Desktop**: full 3D scene with post-processing, high particle counts, detailed geometry
- **Tablet**: reduced particle counts, simplified geometry, no post-processing
- **Mobile**: fallback to CSS animations, static images, or minimal 3D (simple rotating shape)
- Detect device capability with `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` and `renderer.capabilities`
- Use `useMediaQuery` or `window.matchMedia` to conditionally render 3D vs. fallback
- Set `pixelRatio` to `Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio, 2)` — no need for 3x on mobile

```tsx
// Example: responsive 3D fallback
const isMobile = useMediaQuery('(max-width: 768px)');

return isMobile ? (
  <AnimatedGradientBackground /> // lightweight CSS fallback
) : (
  <Canvas>
    <HeroScene />
  </Canvas>
);
```

---

## Step 12 — Testing & Quality Assurance

---

## Step 13 — Production Build, Deployment & Error Resolution (MANDATORY)

**This step is non-negotiable.** After the build is complete, the agent MUST run these checks and fix every issue before declaring the task done.

### 13.1 — Build & Deploy Preparation

1. Optimize bundle: tree-shake unused imports, analyze with `next build --analyze`
2. Compress 3D assets: draco-compress glTF models, optimize textures to WebP/AVIF
3. Configure `next.config.js` for optimal output
4. Run `next build` and verify zero errors
5. Test production build locally with `next start`

### Deployment Targets

| Platform | Command | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Vercel | `vercel --prod` | Best for Next.js, automatic optimization |
| Netlify | `netlify deploy --prod` | Good for static exports |
| Cloudflare Pages | `wrangler pages deploy` | Edge-first, global CDN |

### 13.2 — Automated Error Resolution

```bash
npm install          # Catch missing packages
npx tsc --noEmit     # Catch ALL type errors
npm run build        # Catch build-time errors
npx next lint        # Catch code quality issues
```

**If any command fails:** read the error, fix it, re-run, repeat until zero errors.

### 13.3 — 3D-Specific Error Checks

| Check | What to Look For | Fix |
|-------|-----------------|-----|
| **WebGL context** | `<Canvas>` renders without console errors | Add error boundary, check WebGL support |
| **Shader compilation** | GLSL errors in custom shaders | Fix shader syntax, test uniforms |
| **Model loading** | `.glb/.gltf` files 404 | Check paths, ensure files in `public/` |
| **Memory leaks** | `useEffect` cleanup disposes geometries/materials | Add `geometry.dispose()`, `material.dispose()` |
| **SSR crashes** | R3F components in server components | Use `'use client'` directive, `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false` |
| **Missing Suspense** | `<Canvas>` without `<Suspense>` boundary | Wrap 3D scenes in `<Suspense fallback={...}>` |

### 13.4 — Final Resolution Loop

```
WHILE errors exist:
  1. Run: npm run build → IF fail → fix → GOTO 1
  2. Run: npx next lint → IF fail → fix → GOTO 1
  3. Run: npm run dev → IF crash → fix → GOTO 1
  4. All clear → EXIT
```

**The agent MUST NOT declare the task complete until:**
- [ ] `npm run build` exits with code 0
- [ ] `npx next lint` passes (no errors)
- [ ] `npm run dev` boots without crashing
- [ ] No TypeScript errors (`npx tsc --noEmit` passes)
- [ ] 3D scenes load with proper Suspense boundaries
- [ ] No hydration mismatch warnings

> **Rule: If you generated the code, you own the errors. Fix them before finishing.**

---

## Visual Quality Validation

Before finalizing, validate against these standards. If any answer is "no" — go back and fix it.

**Typography**
- [ ] Type hierarchy is strong (display > h1 > h2 > body are clearly distinct)
- [ ] Headings use negative letter-spacing (-0.02em to -0.04em)
- [ ] Body text is 16–18px with 1.5–1.7 line height
- [ ] Lines capped at 65–75 characters maximum width

**Spacing & Layout**
- [ ] Every spacing value comes from the defined scale
- [ ] Sections have generous vertical padding (80–128px on desktop)
- [ ] Layout feels spacious and intentional, nothing cramped

**Color & Polish**
- [ ] Primary color used sparingly — CTAs and key accents only
- [ ] Gradients are subtle and purposeful
- [ ] Interactive elements have hover/focus states with smooth transitions
- [ ] Shadows are colored/tinted, never pure black rgba(0,0,0,x)

**3D & Animation**
- [ ] 3D elements serve the product narrative, not just decoration
- [ ] Animations are smooth at 60fps
- [ ] Loading states exist for 3D content
- [ ] Mobile has appropriate fallbacks

**Overall Impression**
- [ ] The UI looks premium and modern — not like a generic template
- [ ] It resembles award-winning websites (Awwwards quality)
- [ ] The design serves this specific product's niche and audience
- [ ] A user would trust and respect this product based on visual quality alone
- [ ] The 3D integration feels natural and purposeful, not gimmicky

---

## Anti-Patterns — What to Avoid

Understanding what fails helps you avoid it:

| Anti-Pattern | What Goes Wrong | Fix |
|-------------|----------------|-----|
| **3D carnival** | Too many 3D elements competing for attention | One hero 3D scene + subtle ambient elements |
| **Performance blindness** | Beautiful but loads in 8 seconds | Performance budgets, lazy load, compress assets |
| **Mobile neglect** | 3D crashes on phones | Device detection, progressive enhancement, CSS fallbacks |
| **Rainbow soup** | Too many unrelated colors | Stick to your palette — primary, neutral, 1–2 accents |
| **Wall of identical cards** | No visual hierarchy | Vary sizes, highlight featured items, use visual weight |
| **Bootstrap syndrome** | Default template look with swapped colors | Design from scratch using the visual system you defined |
| **Shader overkill** | Complex shaders tank frame rate | Simple materials, emissive glow, use post-processing sparingly |
| **Animation overload** | Everything moves, nothing rests | Strategic motion — animate to guide attention, not to decorate |
| **Hover-only 3D** | Touch devices can't interact | Support both pointer and touch, provide passive animation |
| **Decorative 3D** | 3D elements with no connection to product | Every 3D element should reinforce the product story |
| **The gray wasteland** | Everything is gray with no visual interest | Use contrast deliberately and accent colors surgically |
| **Lorem ipsum laziness** | Placeholder text makes design unjudgeable | Write realistic copy that matches the product's voice |
| **Typography neglect** | All text looks the same size/weight | Build clear hierarchy: display, heading, subhead, body |

### The "Awwwards or Redo" Test

After building, honestly evaluate:

1. **Screenshot test** — Put your screenshot next to Linear.app, Stripe.com, or an Awwwards winner. Does it belong?
2. **Squint test** — Squint at the page. Clear visual hierarchy? Important elements dominant?
3. **3-second test** — Show it for 3 seconds. Can someone tell what the product does?
4. **Motion test** — Scroll through once. Does the animation feel choreographed or chaotic?

If any answer is "no" — iterate before delivery.

## Final Output

The AI must generate:

- **Complete frontend code** — full Next.js project with TypeScript
- **Modular component system** — reusable, typed, well-organized
- **Modern responsive layout** — beautiful on every screen size
- **Smooth animation system** — scroll reveals, hovers, micro-interactions at 60fps
- **3D interactive experience** — Three.js/R3F scene integrated purposefully into the design
- **Performance-optimized build** — lazy-loaded 3D, compressed assets, efficient rendering
- **Realistic content** — believable copy, real-sounding data, proper text lengths
- **Design system documentation** — brief summary of palette, typography, and design rationale

The final result must feel like an **award-winning modern product website** — the kind featured on Awwwards, not the kind generated by a template builder.

### Cross-Agent Compatibility

This skill works with any AI coding agent that supports Markdown-based skill files:

| Agent | Installation |
|-------|-------------|
| Claude Code | `npx skills add deveshpunjabi/3d-website-skill` |
| Cursor | Copy to `.cursor/skills/` |
| Windsurf | Copy to `.windsurf/skills/` |
| Cline | Copy to `.cline/skills/` |
| Codex | Copy to `.codex/skills/` |
| Aider | Reference in `.aider.conf` |
| Any agent | Copy skill directory to the agent's skill/instruction folder |

The skill is Markdown-based with optional reference documents — no runtime dependencies, no API keys, no build steps.
