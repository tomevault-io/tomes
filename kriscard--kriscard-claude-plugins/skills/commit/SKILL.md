# Git Commit Workflow

Direct execution of git commit workflow - no agent delegation, fast and simple.

## Trigger Phrases

This skill activates on:
- "commit changes", "commit this", "commit my work"
- "save to git", "save my changes", "save this to git"
- "push this", "push my changes", "push my work"
- "create a commit", "make a commit"
- "git commit", "check in my changes"

## Proactive Triggering

After completing implementation work, **proactively offer** to commit:
- "I've finished implementing the feature. Would you like me to commit these changes?"
- Use AskUserQuestion with options: "Yes, commit now" / "No, I'll review first"

## Workflow

### Step 1: Assess Changes

```bash
git status
git diff
```

**If no changes:** Report "No changes to commit" and end.

### Step 2: Stage Files

Stage logically related changes:
```bash
git add <files>
```

**Skip sensitive files:** .env, credentials, tokens - warn user if detected.

### Step 3: Create Conventional Commit

Analyze changes and determine:
- **Type:** feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore
- **Scope:** Component/area affected
- **Subject:** Imperative, lowercase, max 50 chars, no period

**Commit format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[Narrative body explaining WHAT and WHY - 2-4 sentences, NO bullet points]
```

**Good example:**
```
feat(auth): add session timeout handling

Implements automatic session refresh when user activity is detected
within the timeout window. Sessions now persist across page reloads
using localStorage with encrypted tokens.
```

**Bad example (avoid):**
```
feat(auth): add features

- Added timeout
- Added refresh
- Added localStorage
```

### Step 4: Execute Commit

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<commit message here>
EOF
)"
```

### Step 5: Handle Pre-commit Hooks

If hooks modify files:
1. Stage the modified files
2. Amend the commit: `git commit --amend --no-edit`

### Step 6: Ask About Push

Use AskUserQuestion:
- "Commit successful! Push to remote?"
- Options: "Yes, push now" / "No, keep local"

### Step 7: Push (if confirmed)

```bash
git push
# or if no upstream:
git push -u origin <branch>
```

## Gotchas

- Pre-commit hooks that modify files (formatters, linters) require re-staging — after hook failure, stage modified files and create a NEW commit (don't amend, as that modifies the previous commit)
- `git add .` can accidentally stage unrelated files — prefer staging specific files by name
- Claude tends to write commit bodies as bullet lists — use narrative prose (2-4 sentences) instead
- When no upstream branch exists, `git push` fails silently — must use `git push -u origin <branch>`
- Never amend commits already pushed to shared branches — this rewrites history others may have pulled

## Safety Rules

- NEVER commit .env files or credentials
- NEVER force push without explicit user request
- NEVER amend commits on shared branches without warning
- Always show what will be committed before committing
