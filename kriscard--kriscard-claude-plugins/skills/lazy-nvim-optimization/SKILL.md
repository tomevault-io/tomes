# Lazy.nvim Optimization

Diagnose and fix Neovim startup performance through profiling and targeted lazy-loading.

## Profiling Workflow

When a user reports slow startup, follow this sequence — don't skip to solutions.

### Step 1: Measure Baseline

```bash
nvim --startuptime startup.log && tail -1 startup.log
```

Compare against targets:
- < 30ms: Excellent
- 30-50ms: Good
- 50-100ms: Acceptable
- > 100ms: Needs work

### Step 2: Identify Slow Plugins

```vim
:Lazy profile
```

Look for plugins with load time > 10ms. These are your optimization targets. Sort by time, not alphabetically.

Also check the startup log for:
- Files taking > 10ms to source
- `setup()` functions taking > 5ms
- Synchronous operations blocking startup

### Step 3: Apply Lazy-Loading

For each slow plugin, choose the right trigger:

| Plugin Type | Trigger | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Has clear commands | `cmd` | `cmd = "Telescope"` |
| Accessed via keybindings | `keys` | `keys = { "<leader>e" }` |
| Language-specific | `ft` | `ft = { "rust", "go" }` |
| Needed after UI renders | `event = "VeryLazy"` | UI enhancements |
| Needed when editing | `event = "BufReadPost"` | Git signs, diagnostics |
| Needed in insert mode | `event = "InsertEnter"` | Completion, autopairs |
| Only used as dependency | `lazy = true` | plenary.nvim |

### Step 4: Verify Improvement

```bash
nvim --startuptime startup-after.log && tail -1 startup-after.log
```

Compare total times. Then `:Lazy profile` to verify plugins load when expected.

## What NOT to Lazy-Load

These need to load at startup — don't fight it:

- **Colorscheme** — Set `priority = 1000` so it loads first. Visible flash if deferred.
- **Treesitter** — Needed for syntax highlighting immediately. Deferring causes flicker.
- **Statusline** — Visible at startup. Deferring causes layout shift.
- **which-key** — Only if it shows on startup. Otherwise can lazy-load.
- **LSP base setup** — Though individual servers can lazy-load by filetype.

## Common Bottlenecks

**Synchronous system calls at startup:**
```lua
-- Bad: blocks startup
vim.fn.system("git status")

-- Good: defer it
vim.defer_fn(function()
  vim.fn.system("git status")
end, 100)
```

**Loading all LSP servers at once:**
Consider loading LSP servers per-filetype instead of all at startup. Each server you don't load saves 5-15ms.

**Plugins without any trigger:**
A bare `{ "plugin/name" }` spec loads at startup. Always add a trigger unless the plugin genuinely needs immediate availability.

## Performance Checklist

### Startup

- [ ] Colorscheme has `priority = 1000`
- [ ] File explorers load on cmd/keys
- [ ] Git interfaces load on cmd/keys
- [ ] Completion loads on `InsertEnter`
- [ ] Language plugins load on filetype
- [ ] UI enhancements load on `VeryLazy`

### Runtime

- [ ] Telescope uses fzf-native extension
- [ ] Treesitter parsers installed only for used languages
- [ ] LSP servers only for filetypes you use
- [ ] No plugins duplicating built-in 0.10+ features

### Config

- [ ] No synchronous system calls at startup
- [ ] `setup()` only runs when plugins load
- [ ] Keymaps defined with plugin lazy-loading
- [ ] Auto-commands use specific events, not `"*"`
