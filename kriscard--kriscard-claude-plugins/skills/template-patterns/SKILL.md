# Template Usage & Application Patterns

Quick reference for selecting and applying the right Obsidian template. Templates are in the `Templates/` folder at vault root.

## Template Selection

### Decision Tree

**Temporal tracking:**
- Daily journaling → `Daily Notes.md`
- Weekly review → `Weekly Planning.md`
- Monthly goals → `Monthly Goals.md`
- Quarterly planning → `Quarterly Goals.md`

**Meetings:**
- Regular meetings → `Meeting Notes.md`
- One-on-one → `1-on-1 Meeting Notes.md`

**Projects:**
- Starting new project → `Project Brief.md`
- Planning details → `Project Planning.md`
- Software feature → `Feature Implementation.md`
- Bug tracking → `Bug Fix.md`

**Learning:**
- General learning → `Learning.md`
- Technical tutorials → `Learning Tech Template.md`
- Book notes → `Book Reviews.md`

**Organization:**
- Creating index/hub → `MOC Template.md`
- Person notes → `People.md`
- Generic → `General Notes.md`

**Other:**
- Problem analysis → `Problem Solving.md`
- Work communication → `Communicate your work.md`
- Fitness → `Weekly Workout.md`

## Essential Sections

Every knowledge note should include these sections (enforced by templates):

### Related Section (required for concept notes)

```markdown
## Related
*Link 2-5 related notes with a reason why.*
- [[Note Name]] — brief reason for connection
- [[Another Note]] — why it relates
```

Purpose: Enforces the 2-Link Rule and builds the knowledge graph.

### Encounters Section (for evergreen/learning notes)

```markdown
# Encounters
*Real-world bugs, usage, and insights. Add entries when you encounter this concept in practice.*

## YYYY-MM-DD - [Brief title]
[What happened, what you learned]
Link: [[TIL or project note]]
```

Purpose: Makes notes living documents that grow with experience.

## How to Apply Templates

**Via command:** Run `/apply-template`, select from list, template applied to current note.

**Via daily-startup:** Daily notes auto-created using `Daily Notes.md` template.

**Manually:** Open template file, copy content, paste into new note.

## Gotchas

- Wrong template selection wastes time — use the decision tree, don't guess based on note title alone
- The Related section is required for concept notes — skipping it creates orphaned knowledge that's hard to find later
- Encounters section only belongs on evergreen/learning notes, not on meeting notes or daily notes
- Templates are in `Templates/` at vault root — don't confuse with the PARA folders
- When creating from template via CLI, use `template=` parameter — don't manually copy-paste template content

## Integration with Plugin Commands

- `/daily-startup` → auto-applies `Daily Notes.md`
- `/apply-template` → interactive selection from all templates
- `/review-okrs` → uses `Quarterly Goals.md`, `Monthly Goals.md`, `Weekly Planning.md`
