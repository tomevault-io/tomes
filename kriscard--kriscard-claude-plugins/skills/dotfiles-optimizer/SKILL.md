# Dotfiles Optimizer - Main Orchestrator

Coordinate comprehensive analysis and optimization of dotfiles with intelligent, context-aware recommendations. Reads the dotfiles path from `.claude/dotfiles-optimizer.local.md` (defaults to `~/.dotfiles`).

## Arguments

When invoked via `/optimize`, the following arguments are supported:

**Component Scope** (optional, positional):
- `zsh` - Shell configuration only
- `tmux` - Tmux configuration only
- `nvim` - Neovim configuration only
- `git` - Git configuration only
- `terminal` - Terminal configs (Kitty/Ghostty) only
- `all` or omitted - Entire dotfiles structure

**Flags** (optional):
- `--apply` - Automatically apply critical and recommended fixes without confirmation
- `--security` - Focus analysis on security issues only
- `--performance` - Focus analysis on performance optimization only
- `--modern-tools` - Focus on modern tool recommendations only

**Examples**: `/optimize`, `/optimize zsh`, `/optimize --security`, `/optimize zsh --apply`, `/optimize --performance`

## When to Use

Activate this skill when users request:
- General optimization ("optimize my dotfiles", "improve my shell")
- Security audits ("check for exposed credentials", "audit my configs")
- Performance improvements ("make my shell faster", "speed up zsh startup")
- Modern tool recommendations ("what CLI tools should I use")
- Configuration analysis ("analyze my setup", "check my tmux config")

## Workflow

### 1. Determine Scope

Infer scope from context: if user is editing a specific config file, focus there. If they request a specific component, scope to it. Otherwise analyze everything. Load dotfiles path from `.claude/dotfiles-optimizer.local.md` (default: `/Users/kriscard/.dotfiles`). Check for `dotfiles_path` override and `enable_proactive_warnings` setting.

### 2. Invoke Analysis Agent

Call `dotfiles-analyzer` agent with the determined scope for deep analysis (2-3 min). The agent parses configs, checks security issues, identifies performance bottlenecks, suggests modern CLI alternatives, and validates patterns against best practices.

### 3. Reference Best Practices

Consult `dotfiles-best-practices` skill for modern CLI tools, shell performance techniques, security patterns, config organization strategies, and git workflow improvements. Use this to enhance the analyzer's findings with context and rationale.

### 4. Generate Prioritized Recommendations

Organize findings into three tiers:
- **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, insecure permissions, breaking errors, data loss risks
- **Recommended**: Performance optimizations, modern tool suggestions, better patterns, missing best practices
- **Optional**: Aesthetic improvements, nice-to-have features, alternative approaches

Format output as: `## Analysis Results for [Scope]` with each tier listing count and items with location/remediation/rationale.

### 5. Offer to Apply Fixes

Present options: all critical (recommended), all improvements, specific items, or none. For `--apply` flag: auto-apply critical + recommended, skip optional. When applying: use Read/Edit tools, explain each change, validate syntax. Always create timestamped backups before modifying files.

### 6. Integration with Existing Tools

The user's `dotfiles` CLI (`/Users/kriscard/.dotfiles/dotfiles`) handles init, sync, backup, and doctor. This plugin provides analysis, security scanning, best practice validation, and modern tool suggestions. Defer to their script for mechanical operations.

## Gotchas

- Always create timestamped backups before modifying any file -- changes to shell config can break the terminal
- The user has an existing `dotfiles` CLI script -- complement it, don't duplicate its functionality (init, sync, backup)
- Default dotfiles path is `/Users/kriscard/.dotfiles` -- check `.claude/dotfiles-optimizer.local.md` for overrides
- Security issues (exposed credentials) are ALWAYS critical priority -- never downgrade them
- Don't suggest replacing tools the user already has configured -- check existing aliases first

## Output Best Practices

- Include file paths and line numbers; show before/after examples
- Provide exact commands or edits; link to docs when relevant
- Explain rationale -- help user learn, not just fix

## Reference Files

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `references/component-analysis.md` | Per-component analysis details, modern tool table, security and performance checklists |
| `references/analysis-patterns.md` | Credential detection regex, lazy loading templates, tool configs, common issue fixes |

## Related

- **Skill**: `dotfiles-best-practices` -- knowledge base for patterns and modern tools
- **Agent**: `dotfiles-analyzer` -- deep file-by-file analysis, activated by this orchestrator
- **Commands**: `/optimize` (full workflow), `/audit` (read-only analysis)

## Example Session

```
User: "Optimize my dotfiles"

1. Scope: Entire dotfiles (no specific context)
2. Invoke dotfiles-analyzer for comprehensive analysis
3. Reference dotfiles-best-practices for context
4. Findings:
   Critical (2): API key in zsh.d/00-env.zsh:45, .gitconfig-work perms 644->600
   Recommended (5): Lazy load nvm (-300ms), eza alias, modularize .zshrc,
     .env.example template, git commit signing
   Optional (3): starship prompt, bat Catppuccin theme, tpm for tmux
5. User: "All critical and recommended"
6. Apply each fix with backup, explanation, and syntax validation
7. Verify changes and confirm completion
```
