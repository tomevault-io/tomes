# Claude Code Analyzer

Optimize your Claude Code workflow by analyzing usage patterns, detecting project structure, and discovering community resources.

## Capabilities

| Feature           | Script                 | Purpose                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Usage Analysis    | `analyze.sh`           | Extract tool/model usage from history        |
| Project Detection | `analyze-claude-md.sh` | Detect stack, suggest CLAUDE.md improvements |
| Feature Reference | `fetch-features.sh`    | List Claude Code capabilities                |
| GitHub Discovery  | `github-discovery.sh`  | Find community skills/agents/commands        |

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze Current Project

Run project structure detection:

```bash
bash scripts/analyze-claude-md.sh
```

If the script is missing or fails, fall back to manual analysis:
- Read the project's CLAUDE.md (or note its absence)
- Check package.json for framework detection
- Scan directory structure for conventions
- Provide CLAUDE.md recommendations based on findings

Identifies:
- Missing CLAUDE.md or incomplete sections
- Undocumented commands or patterns
- Framework-specific suggestions

### 2. Review Usage Patterns

Analyze Claude Code history for current project:

```bash
bash scripts/analyze.sh --current-project
```

If the script is unavailable, suggest the user check:
- Settings > auto-allowed tools (are frequently-used tools approved?)
- Model usage (cost awareness)
- Common workflow patterns

Identifies:
- Most-used tools (optimize auto-allow)
- Model distribution (cost awareness)
- Active projects

### 3. Discover Community Resources

Search GitHub for relevant resources:

```bash
bash scripts/github-discovery.sh all [query]
bash scripts/github-discovery.sh skills react
bash scripts/github-discovery.sh agents typescript
```

If the script is unavailable, search GitHub directly:
```bash
gh search repos "claude-code plugin" --sort stars --limit 10
gh search repos "claude-code skill" --sort stars --limit 10
```

### 4. Generate Recommendations

Based on analysis, provide actionable suggestions:
- CLAUDE.md improvements (load `references/best-practices.md` if available)
- Settings optimizations
- New skills or agents to create
- Community resources to adopt

## Recommendation Patterns

### No CLAUDE.md Detected

1. Run stack detection (script or manual)
2. Generate CLAUDE.md template from detected info
3. Include commands from package.json scripts
4. Add architecture notes based on directory structure

### Underutilized Features

If analysis shows limited tool variety:
- Suggest auto-allowing frequently-used tools
- Recommend Explore agents for searches
- Propose skills for repeated workflows

### High Tool Usage Without Auto-Allow

If frequently used tools aren't auto-allowed:
- Suggest adding to `autoAllowedTools` in settings
- Reference trust levels in best-practices.md

## Dependencies

- `jq` - JSON processing (required for analyze.sh)
- `gh` - GitHub CLI (optional, enhances github-discovery.sh)

Install: `brew install jq gh`
