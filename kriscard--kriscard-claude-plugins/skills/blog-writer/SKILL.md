# Developer Blog Writer

Transform unstructured thoughts into polished technical blog posts.

## Reference Files

Load these before writing:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `references/voice-tone.md` | Writing voice and style guide |
| `references/story-circle.md` | Narrative framework for posts |
| `references/post-templates.md` | Starter structures by post type |
| `references/seo-checklist.md` | Pre-publish SEO checks |

## Process

### 1. Receive the Brain Dump

Accept whatever is provided:
- Scattered thoughts and ideas
- Technical points to cover
- Code snippets or commands
- Conclusions or takeaways

Don't require organization. The mess is the input.

### 2. Load Voice Guide

Read `references/voice-tone.md` for writing style:
- Professional-casual tone
- First-person, inclusive language ("we", "us")
- Show the journey, not just the destination

### 3. Identify Post Type

| Type | Use When |
|------|----------|
| Tutorial | Step-by-step instructions |
| Project Showcase | Sharing what you built |
| Opinion | Your take on a topic |
| TIL | Quick, focused insight |
| Comparison | X vs Y analysis |

### 4. Check for Story Potential

Read `references/story-circle.md` and look for:
- Journey from confusion to clarity
- Problem you solved
- Something learned the hard way
- Perspective shift

### 5. Organize & Write

**Opening:** Hook with problem, question, or motivation. No "In this post, I will..."

**Body:**
- Vary paragraph length
- Include specific details
- Show actual code
- Be honest about what didn't work

**Ending:**
- Tie back to opening
- Actionable takeaway
- Forward-looking ("Stay tuned for...")

### 6. Review & Optimize

**Voice check:**
- Does it sound like a developer talking to peers?
- Is there a clear thread from start to finish?

**SEO check** (from `references/seo-checklist.md`):
- [ ] Primary keyword in title and first paragraph
- [ ] Meta description (150-160 chars)
- [ ] URL slug is short and clean
- [ ] 2-3 internal/external links
- [ ] Code blocks specify language

## Quick Voice Reference

### Do:
- Write like explaining to a smart colleague
- Admit uncertainty or mistakes
- Use specific examples with real details
- Show what you tried, not just what worked

### Don't:
- Use corporate or marketing speak
- Over-explain basic concepts
- Start with "In this post..." or "As we all know..."
- Force humor or excessive emojis

## Gotchas

- Claude defaults to "In this post, we'll explore..." openings — always check the opening against voice guide
- Tendency to over-explain basics to the audience — assume readers are experienced developers
- Always load `references/voice-tone.md` before writing — without it, output sounds generic
- Claude often produces uniform paragraph lengths — vary intentionally (short punchy + longer detailed)
- SEO optimization should be subtle — don't keyword-stuff or write for search engines over humans
- Code examples should be real and runnable, not pseudocode — readers will copy-paste them
