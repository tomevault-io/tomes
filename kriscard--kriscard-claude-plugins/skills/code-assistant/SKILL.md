# Code Assistant

Intelligent orchestrator that analyzes your coding request and automatically selects the most appropriate specialist agent or coordinates multiple agents for complex tasks.

## When to Use

This skill triggers automatically when you need help with:
- Writing new code or features
- Debugging issues or errors
- Refactoring existing code
- Frontend development
- TypeScript-specific work
- React applications
- Tanstack Start applications
- Next.js applications
- Code security reviews
- UI/UX design decisions

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Analysis
Analyzes your request to determine:
- **Language/framework** (TypeScript, React, Next.js, etc.)
- **Task type** (new code, debugging, refactoring, review, design)
- **Complexity** (single agent vs multi-agent coordination)
- **Security sensitivity** (client-side security concerns)
- **Performance concerns** (waterfalls, bundle size, RSC optimization)
- **Code audit requests** (best practices check, review for patterns)

### Phase 2: Agent Selection

Based on analysis, selects the optimal specialist:

| Context | Selected Agent | Why |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| TypeScript code | `typescript-coder` | Type-safe, idiomatic TypeScript |
| React/Vue components | `frontend-developer` | Modern frontend patterns |
| Next.js specific | `nextjs-developer` | App Router, RSC expertise |
| React/Next.js performance | `react-best-practices` skill | Waterfall elimination, bundle optimization |
| React best practices audit | `react-best-practices` skill | Code review against 45 Vercel rules |
| Client-side security | `frontend-security-coder` | XSS prevention, sanitization |
| Debugging issues | `debugger` | Error analysis specialist |
| Code review needed | `code-reviewer` | Quality assurance |
| Refactoring task | `code-refactoring-specialist` | Clean code patterns |
| UI/UX decisions | `ui-ux-designer` | Design systems |
| General implementation | `coder` | Versatile fallback |

### Phase 3: Coordination

For complex requests requiring multiple agents:
1. **Primary agent** handles main task
2. **Secondary agents** handle supporting tasks
3. **Orchestrator** coordinates handoffs

**Example multi-agent workflow:**
```
Request: "Build a secure Next.js form with TypeScript"
     ↓
Orchestrator coordinates:
  1. nextjs-developer → Creates form component structure
  2. typescript-coder → Adds type-safe validation
  3. frontend-security-coder → Implements XSS protection
  4. ui-ux-designer → Reviews accessibility
     ↓
Delivers complete, secure, well-typed component
```

## Agent Profiles

### typescript-coder
**Expertise:** Type-safe TypeScript, "inevitable code" patterns
**Best for:** Complex typing, generics, strict type safety

### frontend-developer
**Expertise:** React 19+, Vue 3, modern web development
**Best for:** Component composition, state management, performance

### nextjs-developer
**Expertise:** Next.js 14+, App Router, Server Components
**Best for:** Full-stack Next.js, SSR, edge functions

### frontend-security-coder
**Expertise:** Client-side security, XSS prevention
**Best for:** User input handling, sanitization, security reviews

### debugger
**Expertise:** Error analysis, test failures, unexpected behavior
**Best for:** Fixing bugs, understanding stack traces

### code-reviewer
**Expertise:** Code quality, best practices, security scanning
**Best for:** PR reviews, quality assurance

### code-refactoring-specialist
**Expertise:** Clean code, reducing complexity, maintainability
**Best for:** Simplifying logic, improving readability

### ui-ux-designer
**Expertise:** Interface design, accessibility, design systems
**Best for:** Component design, user flows, design tokens

### coder
**Expertise:** General implementation from specifications
**Best for:** PRD-based development, general coding tasks

## Selection Algorithm

```
IF request contains ["Next.js", "App Router", "Server Component"]
   → nextjs-developer

ELSE IF request contains ["React" AND ("best practices" OR "audit" OR "optimize" OR "performance")]
   → react-best-practices skill

ELSE IF request contains ["waterfall", "bundle size", "re-render", "RSC optimization"]
   → react-best-practices skill

ELSE IF request contains ["TypeScript" AND (complex types OR generics)]
   → typescript-coder

ELSE IF request contains ["React", "Vue", "frontend", "component"]
   → frontend-developer

ELSE IF request contains ["XSS", "sanitize", "security", "user input"]
   → frontend-security-coder

ELSE IF request contains ["debug", "error", "bug", "failing test"]
   → debugger

ELSE IF request contains ["review", "code quality", "best practices"]
   → code-reviewer

ELSE IF request contains ["refactor", "simplify", "clean up"]
   → code-refactoring-specialist

ELSE IF request contains ["design", "UI", "UX", "interface"]
   → ui-ux-designer

ELSE IF request contains specific implementation requirements
   → coder

ELSE
   → Ask user to clarify or use coder as default
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Automatic Selection
```
User: "I need to debug this React component that's crashing"

Code Assistant analyzes:
  - Task: debugging
  - Framework: React
  - Primary concern: errors

Selects: debugger agent
Announces: "Using debugger to analyze your React component issue"
```

### Example 2: Multi-Agent Coordination
```
User: "Create a user registration form in Next.js with TypeScript validation"

Code Assistant analyzes:
  - Framework: Next.js
  - Language: TypeScript
  - Task: new feature
  - Concerns: validation, security

Coordinates:
  1. nextjs-developer creates form structure
  2. typescript-coder adds type-safe validation
  3. frontend-security-coder reviews input handling

Delivers: Complete, type-safe, secure registration form
```

### Example 3: Ambiguous Request
```
User: "Help me with my code"

Code Assistant:
  "I can help! To select the best specialist, could you tell me more:
   - What language/framework? (React, Next.js, TypeScript, etc.)
   - What do you need? (new feature, debugging, refactoring, review)
   - Any specific concerns? (performance, security, types)"
```

## Override Options

Users can explicitly request specific agents:
- "Use typescript-coder for this"
- "I want the nextjs-developer"
- "Let the debugger handle this"

When explicit request is made, orchestrator defers to user choice.

## Gotchas

- Don't over-route simple tasks — if the user just wants a quick fix, do it directly instead of spawning a specialist agent
- Agent overhead adds ~5 seconds — for trivial changes (rename, add a log, fix a typo), skip orchestration entirely
- The selection algorithm is a guideline, not rigid rules — use judgment when context suggests a different agent
- Multi-agent coordination is sequential — don't promise parallel execution
- When the user explicitly names an agent ("use the debugger"), defer to their choice immediately

## Fallback Behavior

If no clear agent match:
1. Ask clarifying questions
2. Use `coder` as versatile default
3. Announce selection rationale

## Performance Notes

- **Analysis overhead:** ~5 seconds for complex requests
- **Single agent:** Same as direct agent invocation
- **Multi-agent:** Sequential execution (no parallelization yet)

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Parallel multi-agent execution
- [ ] Learning from past selections
- [ ] Context-aware preloading
- [ ] User preference memory
