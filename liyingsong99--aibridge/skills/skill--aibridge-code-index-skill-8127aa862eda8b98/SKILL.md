# AIBridge Code Index Skill

## Operating Rules

- Enablement: Root Rule only; do not call `$CLI harness status` to re-check
- Public actions: `symbol`, `definition` only — locate `.cs` paths/positions, then read files yourself
- `--query` must be a C# identifier or identifier substring (e.g. `PlayerController`, `OpenInventory`)
- Do not query natural language, Chinese business names, comments, string literals, or file paths
- Unknown identifier: use host text search first, then call `code_index` with the discovered name
- Matching is declaration-name substring only — not full-text or semantic search
- Read `success` / `items` / `error`; ignore absent diagnostic fields. `items: []` means no name hit, not a daemon failure
- Do not use for references/callers/implementations/diagnostics/relationship queries
- On failure: do not retry lifecycle/status; fall back to direct file reads

## Commands

```bash
$CLI code_index symbol --query PlayerController
$CLI code_index definition --query PlayerController
```
