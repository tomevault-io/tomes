# Gemini Oracle

Use Google Gemini CLI as a **planning oracle** and **code reviewer**. Gemini provides analysis and recommendations; Claude synthesizes and presents to the user.

**Critical**: This skill is for planning and review ONLY. Never use Gemini to implement changes.

## Prerequisites

Before invoking Gemini, validate availability:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/oracle-gemini/scripts/check-gemini.sh
```

If the script exits non-zero, display the error message and stop. Do not proceed without Gemini CLI.

## Configuration Defaults

| Setting | Default           | User Override            |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Model   | `gemini-2.5-pro`  | "use flash"              |
| Sandbox | `--sandbox`       | Not overridable (safety) |
| Timeout | 5 minutes minimum | Based on complexity      |
| Output  | `text`            | "use json output"        |

### Timeout Guidelines

When invoking `gemini` via the Bash tool, always set an appropriate timeout:

- **Minimum**: 5 minutes (300000ms) for any Gemini operation
- **Simple queries** (single file review, focused question): 5 minutes (300000ms)
- **Moderate complexity** (multi-file review, feature planning): 10 minutes (600000ms)
- **High complexity** (architecture analysis, large codebase planning): 15 minutes (900000ms)

### Model Selection

Choose model based on task requirements:

| Model              | Best For                                             | Speed   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `gemini-2.5-pro`   | Complex analysis, architecture, comprehensive review | Slower  |
| `gemini-2.5-flash` | Quick feedback, single-file review, rapid iteration  | Fastest |

**Selection heuristics:**

- **`gemini-2.5-pro`**: Task involves multiple files, requires deep analysis, or architectural thinking
- **`gemini-2.5-flash`**: Simple queries, single file review, or when speed is prioritized

For detailed model capabilities, consult `references/gemini-flags.md`.

## Workflow

### 1. Validate Prerequisites

Run the check script. On failure, report the installation instructions and abort.

### 2. Determine Mode

- **Planning mode**: User wants architecture, implementation approach, or design decisions
- **Review mode**: User wants code analysis, bug detection, or improvement suggestions

### 3. Construct Prompt

Build a focused prompt for Gemini based on mode:

**Planning prompt template:**

```
Analyze this codebase and provide a detailed implementation plan for: [user request]

Focus on:
- Architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Files to create or modify
- Implementation sequence
- Potential risks or blockers

Do NOT implement anything. Provide analysis and recommendations only.
```

**Review prompt template:**

```
Review the following code for:
- Bugs and logic errors
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Code quality and maintainability
- Adherence to best practices

[code or file paths]

Provide specific, actionable feedback with file locations and line references.
```

### 4. Select Model and Execute Gemini

Before executing, assess task complexity to select appropriate model:

1. **Count files involved** in the query
1. **Evaluate scope** (single module vs cross-cutting)
1. **Consider depth** (surface review vs architectural analysis)

Use **positional prompt syntax** (Gemini CLI does NOT support HEREDOC/stdin). **Always use the Bash tool's timeout parameter** (minimum 300000ms / 5 minutes).

For short prompts, pass directly as a positional argument:

```bash
# Short prompt - direct positional argument
gemini -m gemini-2.5-pro --sandbox -o text "Your prompt here" 2>/dev/null
```

For long prompts, write to a temp file first, then use command substitution:

```bash
# Step 1: Generate unique temp file paths and write prompt
GEMINI_PROMPT="/tmp/gemini-${RANDOM}${RANDOM}.txt"
GEMINI_OUTPUT="/tmp/gemini-${RANDOM}${RANDOM}.txt"
cat > "$GEMINI_PROMPT" <<'EOF'
[constructed prompt with code context]
EOF

# Step 2: Execute Gemini with prompt from file
# Bash tool timeout: 300000-900000ms based on complexity
gemini \
  -m "${MODEL:-gemini-2.5-pro}" \
  --sandbox \
  -o text \
  "$(cat "$GEMINI_PROMPT")" \
  2>/dev/null > "$GEMINI_OUTPUT"
```

**Important flags:**

- `-m`: Model selection (gemini-2.5-pro or gemini-2.5-flash)
- `--sandbox`: Prevents any file modifications (non-negotiable)
- `-o text`: Plain text output (use `json` if user requests structured output)
- `2>/dev/null`: Suppresses error messages and stderr noise

**Bash tool timeout**: Estimate based on task complexity (see Timeout Guidelines above). Never use the default 2-minute timeout for Gemini operations.

### 5. Present Gemini Output

Read the analysis from the temp file and display to the user with clear attribution:

```bash
cat "$GEMINI_OUTPUT"
```

Format the output with clear attribution:

```
## Gemini Analysis

[Gemini output from /tmp/gemini-analysis.txt]

---
Model: gemini-2.5-pro
```

For very large outputs (>5000 lines), summarize key sections rather than displaying everything.

### 6. Synthesize and Plan

After presenting Gemini output:

1. Synthesize key insights from Gemini analysis
1. Identify actionable items and critical decisions
1. **If Gemini's analysis presents multiple viable approaches or significant trade-offs**, consider using `AskUserQuestion` to clarify user preferences before finalizing the plan
1. Write a structured plan to `~/.claude/plans/[plan-name].md`
1. Call `ExitPlanMode` to present the plan for user approval

**When to use AskUserQuestion:**

- Gemini proposes multiple architectures with different trade-offs
- Technology or library choices need user input
- Scope decisions (minimal vs comprehensive) are ambiguous

**Skip clarification when:**

- Gemini's recommendations are clear and unambiguous
- User's original request already specified preferences
- Only one viable approach exists

## Error Handling

| Error                | Response                                              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Gemini not installed | Show installation instructions from check script      |
| Gemini timeout       | Inform user, suggest simpler query or use flash model |
| API rate limit       | Wait and retry, or inform user of limit               |
| Empty response       | Retry once, then report failure                       |

## Usage Examples

1. Synthesize into Claude plan format
1. Write to `~/.claude/plans/` and call `ExitPlanMode`

### Code Review Request
