# Setup GenAI Engine Development Environment

## Step 1 — GPT Key Gate

Use the Read tool to read `./genai-engine/.env`.

Check that `GENAI_ENGINE_OPENAI_GPT_NAMES_ENDPOINTS_KEYS` is present and has a non-empty value (not just `GENAI_ENGINE_OPENAI_GPT_NAMES_ENDPOINTS_KEYS=` with nothing after the `=`).

If the value is missing or empty:
- **STOP immediately. Do not proceed to Step 2.**
- Tell the user: "Setup cannot continue. Please open `genai-engine/.env` and set `GENAI_ENGINE_OPENAI_GPT_NAMES_ENDPOINTS_KEYS` using the format: `MODEL_NAME::ENDPOINT_URL::API_KEY` (e.g. `gpt-4o::https://api.openai.com/::sk-...`). Run the skill again once the key is set."

## Step 2 — Delegate Setup to Bash Sub-Agent

Only proceed here if Step 1 passed. Spawn a Task sub-agent with subagent_type="Bash" and the following self-contained prompt:

---
Run the following setup steps for the GenAI Engine development environment. Report success or failure for each step and stop immediately if any step fails.

**Step 1 — Prerequisites check:**
```bash
python3 --version && docker ps && poetry --version
```
If any fail, report which tool is missing and stop.

**Step 2 — Configure Poetry and install dependencies:**
```bash
cd genai-engine && poetry env use 3.12 && poetry install --with dev,linters
```

**Step 3 — Start PostgreSQL:**
```bash
cd genai-engine && docker compose up -d db && sleep 5 && docker compose ps
```

**Step 4 — Run database migrations with all required env vars:**
```bash
cd genai-engine && \
set -a && source .env && set +a && \
export POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme_pg_password \
  POSTGRES_URL=localhost \
  POSTGRES_PORT=5432 \
  POSTGRES_DB=arthur_genai_engine \
  POSTGRES_USE_SSL=false \
  PYTHONPATH="src:$PYTHONPATH" \
  GENAI_ENGINE_SECRET_STORE_KEY="some_test_key" \
  GENAI_ENGINE_ENVIRONMENT=local \
  GENAI_ENGINE_ADMIN_KEY=changeme123 \
  GENAI_ENGINE_ENABLE_PERSISTENCE=enabled \
  ALLOW_ADMIN_KEY_GENERAL_ACCESS=enabled && \
poetry run alembic upgrade head && poetry run alembic current
```

Report the final migration revision that is current after running these steps.
