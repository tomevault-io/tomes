# Audit Documentation

Discover all CLI commands, web features, and configuration options, then cross-reference against the documentation in `docs/` and `apps/docs/` to identify gaps, outdated content, and missing sections.

## Instructions

Arguments in `$ARGUMENTS` are optional flags:

- `--fix` — after reporting gaps, update the documentation files to fill them
- `--cli-only` — only audit CLI command documentation
- `--web-only` — only audit web feature documentation
- `--verbose` — include per-flag detail in the report
- `--since-last-release` — only check for items added since the last release. Look at the last git tag and determine whether changes since that tag have been documented.

If no arguments are provided, run a full audit and produce a report (no fixes).

### Phase 1: Build the CLI

1. Build the development binary so we have the latest commands:
   ```bash
   cd apps/cli && make install-dev
   ```
2. Verify the binary works:
   ```bash
   taskmd-dev --version
   ```

### Phase 2: Discover CLI commands and flags

1. **Get the top-level help**: Run `taskmd-dev --help` and parse the list of available commands.
2. **For each command**, run `taskmd-dev <command> --help` to capture:
   - Usage string
   - Description (Short + Long)
   - All flags (name, type, default, description)
   - Subcommands (e.g., `web start`)
3. For commands with subcommands, recurse: run `taskmd-dev <command> <subcommand> --help`.
4. Also capture global flags from `taskmd-dev --help`.
5. Store all of this as a structured inventory for comparison.

### Phase 3: Discover web features

1. Read the web app source to identify all pages/views:
   - Glob `apps/web/src/pages/*.tsx` for page components
   - Glob `apps/web/src/components/*/` for feature areas
2. Read `apps/web/src/App.tsx` to extract route definitions (URL paths).
3. Read `apps/cli/internal/web/*.go` to identify API endpoints served by the backend.
4. Compile a list of:
   - **Pages**: name, URL path, key features
   - **API endpoints**: method, path, description

### Phase 4: Discover configuration options

1. Read `apps/cli/internal/cli/root.go` to extract global flags and config loading.
2. Read any config-related files (grep for `.taskmd.yaml` or `viper` usage) to find all supported config keys.
3. Check `docs/.taskmd.yaml.example` for documented config options.

### Phase 5: Cross-reference against documentation

For each discovered item, check whether it is documented in both locations:

#### CLI Commands → Documentation

For each command discovered in Phase 2:

1. **`apps/docs/guide/cli.md`** (VitePress site):
   - Is the command listed in the Quick Reference table?
   - Does it have its own section with usage examples?
   - Are all flags documented?
   - Are examples accurate (flag names, defaults match reality)?

2. **`docs/guides/cli-guide.md`** (standalone docs):
   - Same checks as above.

#### Web Features → Documentation

For each page/API endpoint discovered in Phase 3:

1. **`apps/docs/guide/web.md`** (VitePress site):
   - Is the page/view listed?
   - Are key features described?
   - Are API endpoints documented?

2. **`docs/guides/web-guide.md`** (standalone docs):
   - Same checks.

#### Configuration → Documentation

For each config key discovered in Phase 4:

1. **`apps/docs/reference/configuration.md`**:
   - Is the option listed in the Supported Options table?
   - Is there an example?

#### Specification → Documentation

1. Compare `docs/taskmd_specification.md` (authoritative spec) with `apps/docs/reference/specification.md` (VitePress version).
   - Check version numbers match.
   - Check all frontmatter fields are listed in both.
   - Check enum values (status, priority, effort) match.

#### VitePress Navigation

1. Read `apps/docs/.vitepress/config.ts` and verify:
   - All docs pages listed in the sidebar actually exist as files.
   - No orphan pages exist that aren't linked from the sidebar.

### Phase 6: Generate report

Produce a structured markdown report with these sections:

```
## Documentation Audit Report

### Summary
- Total CLI commands: X (documented: Y, missing: Z)
- Total CLI flags: X (documented: Y, missing: Z)
- Total web pages: X (documented: Y, missing: Z)
- Total API endpoints: X (documented: Y, missing: Z)
- Total config options: X (documented: Y, missing: Z)

### CLI Command Gaps
For each undocumented or partially documented command:
- Command name
- What's missing (entire section, specific flags, examples)
- Which doc file(s) need updating

### Web Feature Gaps
For each undocumented page or endpoint:
- Feature name
- What's missing
- Which doc file(s) need updating

### Configuration Gaps
For each undocumented config option:
- Option name
- Which doc file(s) need updating

### Stale/Inaccurate Documentation
Items where docs don't match the actual CLI behavior:
- Flag name mismatches
- Wrong defaults
- Missing or renamed commands
- Version mismatches between spec files

### VitePress Navigation Issues
- Broken sidebar links
- Orphan pages
```

Print the report to stdout.

### Phase 7: Fix gaps (only if `--fix` was passed)

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--fix`:

1. For each gap identified in Phase 6, update the relevant documentation file:
   - Add missing command sections to `apps/docs/guide/cli.md`
   - Add missing flag tables
   - Add missing web feature descriptions to `apps/docs/guide/web.md`
   - Add missing config options to `apps/docs/reference/configuration.md`
   - Sync specification versions
2. Follow the existing documentation style and formatting conventions in each file.
3. After making changes, list all modified files.

If `--fix` was NOT passed, end with: "Run `/audit-docs --fix` to automatically update documentation."

### Error Handling

- If `make install-dev` fails, report the build error and stop.
- If a command's `--help` output can't be parsed, note it in the report and continue.
- If a documentation file doesn't exist, note it as a gap.
