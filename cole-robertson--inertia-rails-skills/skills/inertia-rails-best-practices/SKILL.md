# Inertia Rails Best Practices

A comprehensive guide to building high-quality Inertia.js applications with Ruby on Rails. This skill provides **50+ rules across 8 categories**, prioritized by impact on application quality, performance, and maintainability.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing new Inertia Rails controllers or pages
- Reviewing existing Inertia Rails code
- Refactoring Rails applications to use Inertia
- Optimizing performance of Inertia applications
- Implementing authentication/authorization patterns
- Building forms with validation
- Setting up testing for Inertia responses

## Categories Overview

| # | Category | Priority | Impact |
|---|----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | [Server-Side Setup & Configuration](#1-server-side-setup--configuration) | CRITICAL | Foundation for all Inertia functionality |
| 2 | [Props & Data Management](#2-props--data-management) | CRITICAL | 2-5× performance improvement, security |
| 3 | [Forms & Validation](#3-forms--validation) | HIGH | User experience, data integrity |
| 4 | [Navigation & Routing](#4-navigation--routing) | HIGH | SPA experience, performance |
| 5 | [Performance Optimization](#5-performance-optimization) | MEDIUM-HIGH | 30-70% faster page loads |
| 6 | [Security](#6-security) | MEDIUM-HIGH | Protection against common vulnerabilities |
| 7 | [Testing](#7-testing) | MEDIUM | Code quality, maintainability |
| 8 | [Advanced Patterns](#8-advanced-patterns) | MEDIUM | Scalability, complex use cases |

## Quick Reference

### Server-Side Setup & Configuration (CRITICAL)
