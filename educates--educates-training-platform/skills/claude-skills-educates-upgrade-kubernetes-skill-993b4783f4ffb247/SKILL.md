# Educates Kubernetes Version Upgrade Protocol

Upgrade Kubernetes version support based on `$ARGUMENTS`.

- If `<new-version>` is provided (e.g. `1.35`), add support for that version.
- If `--drop <old-version>` is provided (e.g. `--drop 1.31`), remove that version.
- If no arguments, check `https://www.downloadkubernetes.com/` for the latest stable versions and ask the user whether to keep 3 or 4 versions before proceeding.

We support versions for **linux** on **amd64** and **arm64** only.

## Step 1: Gather Version Information

### For the new kubectl version

1. Fetch checksums for both architectures:
   - `https://dl.k8s.io/v{KUBECTL_VERSION}/kubernetes-client-linux-amd64.tar.gz.sha512`
   - `https://dl.k8s.io/v{KUBECTL_VERSION}/kubernetes-client-linux-arm64.tar.gz.sha512`

   The full version string uses semantic versioning (e.g. `1.35.1`). The short version is `major.minor` (e.g. `1.35`).

2. Find the corresponding kind node image and SHA256 digest at `https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases`. Image format: `kindest/node:v<K8S_VERSION>@sha256:<DIGEST>`

### Current versions

Read `workshop-images/base-environment/Dockerfile` to see which versions are currently installed and their RUN block format. Read `client-programs/pkg/constants/kubernetes.go` to see the current kind image map.

## Step 2: Update All Files

You must update **all** of the following. Do not skip any.

### `workshop-images/base-environment/Dockerfile`

**Adding a new version** — add a `RUN <<EOF` block following the existing pattern:

```dockerfile
RUN <<EOF
    KUBECTL_VERSION=1.35.1
    KUBECTL_SHORT_VERSION=$(echo ${KUBECTL_VERSION} | cut -d. -f1,2)
    CHECKSUM_amd64="<sha512-for-amd64>"
    CHECKSUM_arm64="<sha512-for-arm64>"
    # ... rest of install block (copy from adjacent version block)
EOF
```

**Removing an old version** — delete the entire `RUN <<EOF ... EOF` block for that version.

### Version mapping scripts (3 files with identical logic)

Update the `case` statement in all three files to match the currently supported versions:

- `workshop-images/base-environment/opt/kubernetes/bin/kubectl`
- `workshop-images/base-environment/opt/kubernetes/bin/kubectl-convert`
- `workshop-images/base-environment/opt/eduk8s/etc/setup.d/01-kubernetes.sh`

Pattern rules:
- `1.2*` and `1.3[012]` (or equivalent old versions) → map to the lowest supported version
- One explicit case per supported version (e.g. `1.33`, `1.34`, `1.35`, `1.36`)
- Default fallback (`*`) → the highest supported version

Example for versions 1.33–1.36:

```bash
case "$KUBECTL_VERSION" in
1.2*)
    KUBECTL_VERSION=1.33
    ;;
1.3[012])
    KUBECTL_VERSION=1.33
    ;;
1.33)
    KUBECTL_VERSION=1.33
    ;;
1.34)
    KUBECTL_VERSION=1.34
    ;;
1.35)
    KUBECTL_VERSION=1.35
    ;;
1.36)
    KUBECTL_VERSION=1.36
    ;;
*)
    KUBECTL_VERSION=1.36
    ;;
esac
```

The three files must have **identical** case statement logic.

### `client-programs/pkg/constants/kubernetes.go`

This map is what `educates local cluster create --kubernetes-version` uses to
pick a kind node image, so the digests **must come from the kind release the
CLI vendors** (`sigs.k8s.io/kind` in `client-programs/go.mod`). The node-image
set and digests are kind-version-specific — take them from the matching release
notes at https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases, not an older kind
release.

Update `KubernetesVersionToKindImage` — add new version entries, remove dropped ones:

```go
var KubernetesVersionToKindImage = map[string]string{
    "1.36": "kindest/node:v1.36.x@sha256:<digest>",
    "1.35": "kindest/node:v1.35.x@sha256:<digest>",
    "1.34": "kindest/node:v1.34.x@sha256:<digest>",
    "1.33": "kindest/node:v1.33.x@sha256:<digest>",
}

const DefaultKubernetesVersion = "1.36"
```

`DefaultKubernetesVersion` is the version `local cluster create` uses when
`--kubernetes-version` is not given. It currently tracks the **newest**
supported version (`"1.36"`); if you would rather trade recency for stability,
the second-newest is a reasonable alternative — just keep it consistent with
the code, `go.mod`, and the release notes.

Whenever the supported set or the vendored kind version changes, also update any
**code comments that name a specific version or kind release** so they still
match reality — e.g. the `sigs.k8s.io/kind vX.Y.Z` note in
`pkg/constants/kubernetes.go` and the example node image in the
`Ensuring node image (...)` comment in `pkg/cluster/kindcluster.go`.

### `client-programs/go.mod`

Update `sigs.k8s.io/kind` to the version that supports the new Kubernetes versions. Update `k8s.io/*` dependencies to align with `DefaultKubernetesVersion`:

- For Kubernetes 1.36.x → use `k8s.io/* v0.36.x`
- Packages: `k8s.io/api`, `k8s.io/apimachinery`, `k8s.io/cli-runtime`, `k8s.io/client-go`, `k8s.io/kubectl`
- Also update `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime` to a compatible version

After editing `go.mod`, run:

```bash
cd client-programs && go mod tidy
```

## Keep the vcluster application aligned

The `vcluster` workshop application provisions Kubernetes at its own set of
versions (the `loftsh-kubernetes` images in session-manager), maintained by the
**`educates-upgrade-vcluster`** skill. Keep that set the same as the versions
supported here, and keep the vcluster `K8S_DEFAULT_VERSION` the same as
`DefaultKubernetesVersion`, as long as the vcluster release in use supports them
(check its `images-optional.txt` / `images.txt`).

After changing the supported set here, **ask the user for permission to run
`educates-upgrade-vcluster`** to bring the vcluster application's `K8S_VERSIONS`
/ `K8S_DEFAULT_VERSION` in line (or to accept a deliberate divergence, for
example when the current vcluster release cannot yet provision a newly added
version). Do not silently leave the two sets out of sync.

## Step 3: Verify

Run in order, fix any failures before proceeding:

```bash
# Build the workshop base image (verifies Dockerfile changes)
make build-base-environment

# Build the CLI (verifies go.mod and constants changes)
cd client-programs && go mod tidy && go build ./...
```

## Step 4: Post-Verification Checklist

- [ ] All three version mapping files have identical case statement logic
- [ ] SHA512 checksums are correct for both amd64 and arm64
- [ ] Removed version has no remaining RUN block in Dockerfile
- [ ] `KubernetesVersionToKindImage` contains exactly the supported versions, with digests from the vendored kind release
- [ ] `DefaultKubernetesVersion` matches the intended default (currently the newest supported version)
- [ ] `k8s.io/*` versions in `go.mod` align with `DefaultKubernetesVersion`
- [ ] Code comments naming a specific version or kind release were updated to match
- [ ] `go mod tidy` ran cleanly in `client-programs/`
- [ ] vcluster application k8s set aligned, or divergence agreed with the user (see `educates-upgrade-vcluster`)
