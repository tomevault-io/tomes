# Gaggimate Profile Creation Skill

Create custom espresso extraction profiles for Gaggimate-equipped machines. Gaggimate supports **Simple** and **Pro** profile types, with Pro profiles offering pressure profiling, flow control, and complex transitions.

> Enriched with patterns from [gaggimate-barista](https://github.com/charleshall888/gaggimate-barista) by Charlie Hall.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Information

If not provided, load the user's equipment, basket size, and preferences:
```
Use: manage_user_setup(action="read")
```
Ask about anything still missing:
- Coffee type/origin and roast level
- **Processing method** (washed, natural, honey, anaerobic — affects target pressure)
- Dose amount (**dose = basket size**; don't underdose)
- Desired output ratio (1:2 is classic)
- Flavor goals (more body, more acidity, reduce bitterness, etc.)
- Whether they have a Bluetooth scale (for volumetric stop conditions)

### Step 2: Select Profile Pattern

Load the relevant knowledge files via MCP tools to determine settings:
- **Temperature**: `read_knowledge(action="read", filename="ESPRESSO_BREWING_BASICS")` → "Temperature Guidelines by Roast"
- **Pressure**: `read_knowledge(action="read", filename="PRESSURE_GUIDE")` → roast × processing matrix
- **Profile pattern**: `read_knowledge(action="read", filename="PROFILE_LIBRARY")` → select by roast, process, and style

Quick reference for common patterns:

| Coffee Type | Temperature | Pressure | Profile Pattern |
|-------------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| Light roasts (Ethiopia, Kenya) | 94-96°C | 6-8 bar | Bloom profile |
| Medium roasts (Colombia, Brazil) | 92-94°C | 8-9 bar | Classic 9-bar |
| Medium-dark (Vienna) | 90-92°C | 8-9 bar | Slight decline |
| Dark roasts (French/Italian) | 88-90°C | 7-8 bar | Low pressure with decline |
| Natural process (any roast) | Per roast | -1 bar from washed | Bloom or longer pre-infusion |

### Step 3: Load Reference Files (conditionally)

**Default: load ZERO reference files.** Steps 2 + 4 (knowledge files + inline JSON template) are sufficient for standard profiles built from library patterns. Only load a reference file when a specific trigger applies.

**Stop rule:** Load at most **2 reference files** per profile creation session.

| Reference | Load ONLY when... |
|-----------|--------------------|
| `read_knowledge(action="read", filename="profiles/EXAMPLES")` | Need a JSON template for a style not in PROFILE_LIBRARY.md |
| `read_knowledge(action="read", filename="profiles/PUMP_AND_TRANSITIONS")` | User asks about adaptive flow, ease-in-out transitions, or power mode |
| `read_knowledge(action="read", filename="profiles/STOP_CONDITIONS")` | User asks about combining multiple stop conditions or non-volumetric targets |
| `read_knowledge(action="read", filename="profiles/TROUBLESHOOTING")` | User reports a problem with an **existing** profile — never for new creation |
| `read_knowledge(action="read", filename="profiles/FLOW_VARIABLE_PRESSURE")` | User specifically asks about Automatic Pro technique or flow-based variable pressure |
| `read_knowledge(action="read", filename="profiles/PROFILE_STRUCTURE")` | Almost never — GAGGIMATE_PROFILE_CREATION_GUIDE.md covers the same fields |

### Step 4: Generate Profile JSON

Always output complete, valid JSON with ALL required fields:

```json
{
  "label": "Profile Name",
  "type": "pro",
  "description": "Optional description",
  "temperature": 93,
  "phases": [
    {
      "name": "Phase Name",
      "phase": "preinfusion|brew|decline",
      "valve": 1,
      "duration": 25,
      "temperature": 0,
      "transition": { "type": "instant", "duration": 0, "adaptive": true },
      "pump": { "target": "pressure", "pressure": 9, "flow": 0 },
      "targets": [{ "type": "volumetric", "operator": "gte", "value": 36 }]
    }
  ]
}
```
**Phase naming for shot analysis:** The `analyze_shot` tool classifies phases by substring-matching the `name` field. Use names containing recognised keywords so specific diagnostic metrics are computed per phase:
- **Preinfusion phases**: include `preinfusion`, `pre-infusion`, `soak`, `bloom`, or `fill` (e.g. "Pre-infusion", "Bloom", "Long Soak")
- **Decline/taper phases**: include `decline`, `taper`, or `cooldown` (e.g. "Decline", "Gentle Taper")
- **Brew phases**: any other name works (e.g. "Ramp", "Hold", "Extraction")

If the name contains none of these keywords, the analyzer falls back to telemetry heuristics — but explicit naming is always preferred.

**Volumetric target:** Always set to `dose × ratio` using the user's basket size. Library profiles in PROFILE_LIBRARY.md are sized for 22g — adjust if user's basket differs.

### Step 5: Explain the Profile

After generating JSON, explain:
- What each phase does and why
- How the profile addresses the user's flavor goals
- Any adjustments they might want to try

### Step 6: Upload to Device

After generating the profile, confirm with user then upload:

1. **Ask for confirmation**: "Profile ready. Shall I upload it to your machine?"
2. **Create or update** via `manage_profile` MCP tool (action: `create` for new, `update` for existing)
3. **Verify** the upload succeeded by checking the MCP response

Always add `[AI]` suffix to profile names created by the agent.

## Quick Profile Patterns

### Classic 9-Bar (Medium Roasts)
```
Pre-infusion (4s, flow 3 ml/s) → Ramp (4s to 9 bar) → Hold (25s at 9 bar) → Stop at weight
```

### Bloom Profile (Light Roasts)
```
Fill (5s, flow 2.5 ml/s) → Bloom (8s, pump off) → Ramp (5s to 9 bar) → Hold (20s) → Stop at weight
```

### Lever Simulation (Any Roast)
```
Pre-infusion (5s, flow 3 ml/s) → Peak (5s to 9 bar) → Linear decline (25s to 3 bar) → Stop at weight
```

### Dark Roast Low Pressure
```
Pre-infusion (4s, flow 2.5 ml/s) → Ramp (3s to 7 bar) → Hold (25s) → Taper (4s to 4 bar)
```

## Essential Pump Modes

```json
// Pressure mode - maintain specific pressure
{ "target": "pressure", "pressure": 9, "flow": 4 }

// Flow mode - maintain specific flow rate
{ "target": "flow", "pressure": 9, "flow": 2.5 }

// Adaptive flow - auto-adjust to puck resistance
{ "target": "flow", "pressure": 9, "flow": -1 }

// Power mode (for bloom - pump off)
{ "target": "power", "pressure": 0, "flow": 0 }
```

## Essential Transition Types

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `instant` | Phase starts, step changes |
| `linear` | Standard pressure ramps |
| `ease-in` | Gentle pre-infusion to extraction |
| `ease-out` | Tapering at end of shot |
| `ease-in-out` | Complex profiles, most natural |

## Output Requirements

1. **Always output complete, valid JSON** that can be directly imported
2. **Include all required fields** - don't omit any phase properties
3. **Use sensible defaults** - valve: 1, adaptive: true for most cases
4. **Add a volumetric target** on the final extraction phase (if scale available)
5. **Explain your choices** after the JSON
6. **Upload to device** via MCP after user confirms
