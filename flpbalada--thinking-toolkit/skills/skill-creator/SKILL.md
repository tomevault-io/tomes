# Skill Creator

A guide for creating Claude Code custom skills following Anthropic's official
guidelines.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating a new Claude Code skill from scratch
- Setting up the correct file structure for a skill
- Writing skill metadata (frontmatter)
- Packaging a skill for distribution
- Converting existing documentation into a skill

## Required Structure

Every skill needs a directory with at minimum one `Skill.md` file:

```
my-skill/
└── Skill.md
```

For complex skills with additional resources:

```
my-skill/
├── Skill.md
├── REFERENCE.md       # Detailed reference docs
└── scripts/
    └── helper.py      # Executable code (optional)
```

## Skill.md Format

The `Skill.md` file must begin with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description:
  Brief description of what this skill does and when Claude should use it.
  Maximum 200 characters.
---

# Skill Title

Your skill content here...
```

### Required Metadata Fields

| Field         | Max Length | Purpose                                |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | 64 chars   | Human-friendly identifier              |
| `description` | 200 chars  | Tells Claude when to invoke this skill |

### Optional Metadata Fields

| Field          | Example                      | Purpose                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `dependencies` | `python>=3.8, pandas>=1.5.0` | Required software packages |

## Progressive Disclosure

Structure your skill using progressive disclosure:

1. **Frontmatter** - First level: name and description
2. **Markdown body** - Second level: detailed instructions
3. **REFERENCE.md** - Third level: in-depth documentation

Reference additional files in your Skill.md so Claude knows when to access them.

## Executable Code

Skills can include executable scripts for advanced functionality:

**Supported languages:**

- Python (with pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
- JavaScript/Node.js
- File editing packages
- Visualization tools

**Important:** Dependencies must be pre-installed. Additional packages cannot be
installed at runtime.

## Packaging for Distribution

1. Ensure folder name matches skill name
2. Create a ZIP file of the folder
3. ZIP must contain the skill folder as root (not files directly)

**Correct structure:**

```
my-skill.zip
└── my-skill/
    └── Skill.md
```

**Incorrect structure:**

```
my-skill.zip
└── Skill.md  # Wrong! Missing parent folder
```

## Testing Checklist

**Before packaging:**

- [ ] Skill.md has valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] `name` is ≤64 characters
- [ ] `description` is ≤200 characters and clearly explains when to use
- [ ] All referenced files exist in correct locations
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys

**After enabling:**

- [ ] Try prompts that should trigger the skill
- [ ] Verify Claude loads the skill (check reasoning)
- [ ] Test edge cases and error scenarios

## Best Practices

**Do:**

- Create focused, single-purpose skills
- Write specific descriptions for accurate invocation
- Include example inputs and outputs
- Test incrementally after each change
- Follow open standards (agentskills.io)

**Avoid:**

- One massive skill that does everything
- Vague descriptions that confuse Claude
- Hardcoding sensitive information
- Skipping the testing phase
