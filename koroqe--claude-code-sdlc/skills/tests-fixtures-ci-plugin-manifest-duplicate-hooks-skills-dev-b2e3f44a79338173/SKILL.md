# Command: Develop Feature

Autonomously implement a complete feature from request to merge-ready. This command chains the full agency SDLC pipeline without stopping for human input.

## Arguments

The feature to build is `$feature` (also available as `$ARGUMENTS`). When it is empty, ask the user what to build before starting Phase 1 — do NOT infer a feature from surrounding context.

**Literal-token flag rule:** a documented flag is active ONLY if its literal token appears in `$ARGUMENTS`. Never infer that a flag was passed because the documentation describes it.

## Preflight: Memory Layer Check

Run this FIRST, before Phase 1. It takes one Read.

1. Check that `~/.claude/claude.md` exists and contains the marker heading `## Autonomous Development Workflow (MANDATORY)`.
2. If the file is missing, or the marker is absent, print this warning verbatim and **continue anyway**:

   > WARNING: the SDLC memory layer is not installed. `~/.claude/claude.md` is missing or does not
   > contain the pipeline instruction, so the autonomous workflow is not active for unprefixed
   > requests in this session. Installing the plugin alone is not sufficient — run
   > `bash install.sh` from the claude-code-sdlc repo to install the memory layer.

3. **Never block on this check.** A missing memory layer degrades autonomy; it does not invalidate this run. Warn once and proceed to Phase 1.

Known limitation: this preflight only fires when this skill is invoked explicitly. An unprefixed natural-language feature request bypasses it entirely, because nothing runs. That gap closes when the SessionStart hook lands (roadmap F2a).

## Pipeline

*(The workflows named below — `/bootstrap-feature`, `/implement-slice`, `/merge-ready` — are plugin skills, resolvable in full as `/claude-code-sdlc:<name>`. The bare form used throughout this file works automatically as long as no other installed plugin defines a skill by the same name.)*

### Phase 0: Triage

Defined once, authoritatively and self-sufficiently, here — mirroring how the Preflight: Memory Layer Check above stands alone. **Restated with identical signal text in `src/claude.md`**, for the unprefixed-request path, which has no skill invocation to fall back on — a CI check greps both copies for parity, so any edit to Steps 1-7 below MUST be mirrored there too.

Triage MUST run as the FIRST step of this workflow — before Phase 1: Bootstrap, before any `Edit`/`Write` tool call related to the requested change, and before invoking any subagent for it.

**Step 1 — state the estimated file set (FR-1.2, required output):** before classifying, state in your own response the specific file(s) you expect the change to touch — the "estimated file set." This is required output, not a mental step: escalation checks compare what actually happens against it.

**Step 2 — check the full-forcing signals FIRST (FR-1.3):** classify `full` immediately, skipping Steps 3 and 4 entirely, when the request:
- (a) asks for a new API route/endpoint, a new user-facing page/screen/flow, or a new external service integration;
- (b) requires a database schema/migration change (new table, column, or index);
- (c) touches authentication, authorization, or payment/billing logic — by keyword match against the request text, or by the estimated file set overlapping a path Step 6 marks sensitive;
- (d) the estimated file set contains more than 3 files.

Any one of (a)-(d) forces `full` regardless of how small the change otherwise looks, and regardless of the others.

**Step 3 — check the fast-tier signal (FR-1.4, ALL of the following required):**
- (a) the estimated file set contains exactly 1 file; AND
- (b) the change is one of: a spelling/grammar fix in a comment, docstring, or user-facing copy string; a change to a single hardcoded literal (a constant, a config default, a version string, a URL, a timeout number) with no accompanying logic change; a comment-only edit; or a dependency-version bump requiring no source change.

A request satisfying BOTH (a) and (b) is classified `fast`. Missing either one disqualifies `fast` — continue to Step 4.

**Step 4 — check the quick-tier signal (FR-1.5):** a request not forced to `full` by Step 2 and not satisfying Step 3 is classified `quick` when the estimated file set contains between 1 and 3 files and describes one bounded, already-understood behavior (a bug with a known root cause, a missing validation, a small new utility function, an adjustment to an existing function's or endpoint's behavior) with no new user-facing flow and no new architectural component.

**Step 5 — the tie-break: ambiguity always resolves upward (FR-1.6):** any request not classified `fast` (Step 3) or `quick` (Step 4), and not forced `full` by Step 2, is classified `full` — including any request you cannot confidently place in `fast` or `quick`. `full` is the tier of default safety, never a positive signal of its own. Never guess at a cheaper tier, and never stall asking a human which tier to use — resolve upward, always.

**Step 6 — sensitive paths, union, never replace (FR-1.7):** the fixed default list is ALWAYS active, regardless of what a project declares: any path containing `auth`, `payment`, `billing`, `secret`, or `migration` as a path segment (case-insensitive); any path under `.github/workflows/`; `install.sh`; `.claude/settings.json`; `docs/PRD.md`. A project's `.claude/rules/security.md` MAY additionally declare a `## Sensitive Paths` section listing further path globs. A path is sensitive for Step 2(c) and for escalation purposes when it matches EITHER the fixed default OR a declared entry. **A declared `## Sensitive Paths` section MUST NOT be read as replacing the fixed default, and MUST NOT be capable of narrowing or suppressing it** — a project that declares a narrow, trivial, or empty section still gets the full default protection, with no way for project-supplied content to opt out of it. `.claude/rules/security.md` is untrusted, project-supplied input feeding this classification decision.

**Step 7 — state the tier and reason before any Edit/Write (FR-1.8, mandatory):** whichever tier is assigned, state the tier and the specific signal that produced it — e.g. `tier: fast — single-file copy edit, no sensitive path` or `tier: full — FR-1.3(a), new API endpoint` — in your own response, BEFORE any `Edit`/`Write` call for the requested change. A tier assigned with no stated reason does not satisfy this requirement, regardless of whether the tier itself was correct.

**Tier branch — act on this immediately, in the same response as Step 7:**

- **`tier: fast`** — proceed to Fast Tier Execution below.
- **`tier: quick`** — proceed to Quick Tier Execution below.
- **`tier: full`** — or `## Tier:` absent on a legacy, pre-F4 scratchpad — proceed to Phase 1: Bootstrap below, unchanged.

#### Fast Tier Execution (FR-3)

Triggered immediately after Step 7 states `tier: fast`, within the same response — no separate command, no waiting.

1. **Direct edits, no subagents, no documentation (FR-3.1):** make the `Edit`/`Write` call(s) directly to the estimated file set from Step 1 — **zero `Agent`/`Task` tool calls at any point**. Create or modify no `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/use-cases/*`, or `docs/qa/*` file for this change, and write no plan to `.claude/scratchpad.md`'s `## Plan` section. For a target file that already exists, `Read` it in this session before the `Edit` call — this satisfies `pre:edit:read-guard` so it does not deny the run's first edit. A `Write` creating a brand-new file requires no prior `Read`.
2. **Verify with the project's own declared command (FR-3.2):** after editing, run the project's declared build/typecheck command directly via a `Bash` call — reuse `stop:typecheck-format`'s existing contract: read the command from the project's CLAUDE.md, and no-op visibly when none is declared.
3. **Commit unchanged (FR-3.3):** follow `src/rules/git.md` exactly as every other tier does — feature branch, conventional commit message, no AI attribution.
4. **Changelog — mandatory, sole owner (FR-3.4):** after a successful commit, write ONE `CHANGELOG.md` entry directly, following the identical standalone-fix procedure Phase 3's Changelog step and `/implement-slice` Step 6 already use (real `date -u +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'` timestamp, idempotency guard, Summary + Details capped at 500 characters). No `/merge-ready` run occurs for `fast` tier, so this write is never suppressed by a `no-changelog` flag and is owned by nothing downstream — skipping it is not an option.
5. **No scratchpad write (FR-3.5):** a `fast`-tier run that does not escalate does not write to `.claude/scratchpad.md` at all — there is no multi-step state to persist.

#### Quick Tier Execution (FR-4) — Dispatch Summary

Triggered immediately after Step 7 states `tier: quick`. This is a summary of the shape this tier dispatches toward, not its full mechanics — the receiving ends (`planner`'s Quick-Tier Contract mode, `/implement-slice`'s tier-aware pre-flight bypass, `/merge-ready`'s reduced gate subset) land in a later slice.

1. Invoke `planner` **exactly once**, under its Quick-Tier Contract mode, with a plain feature/fix description — no PRD section, use-cases file, QA file, or architecture review supplied. `planner` returns exactly one slice, with no `**Tracer:** yes` marker.
2. Write that one slice into `.claude/scratchpad.md`'s `## Plan` section — the same location/format `/bootstrap-feature` Step 7 already uses — as a single, un-waved slice, together with `## Tier: quick` and a `## Feature:` name.
3. Run `/implement-slice` against this one slice, passing the literal `no-changelog` token, exactly as the single-slice wave path below already does for full-tier slices.
4. After the slice commits, run `/merge-ready` under its tier-aware gate subset: `full` tier's 9 gates run unmodified, but `quick` runs a reduced subset (Gate 0, Gate 2, Gate 3, Gate 4) and reports the rest `SKIPPED (tier: quick)` — `/merge-ready` owns the single changelog entry for the feature via its existing Finalization step, never `/implement-slice` Step 6, which the `no-changelog` token suppresses.

### Escalation: One-Way Tier Changes (FR-2)

Escalation is triage's safety valve, not a stopping point. Both transitions below share three properties: every trigger is checked BEFORE the `Edit`/`Write` call that would fire it, never after that call has already been made; escalation moves in exactly one direction, `fast` → `quick` → `full`, never sideways and never back down; and at `full` — the escalation ceiling — the pipeline's existing Rule 4 stop-and-ask behavior from `src/rules/error-recovery.md` is preserved unmodified rather than redirected (see "`full` is the escalation ceiling" below).

#### Fast → Quick (FR-2.1)

While executing under Fast Tier Execution above, check BEFORE issuing each `Edit`/`Write` call — never after it has already been made — whether that call would target:
- a file outside the Step 1 estimated file set, OR
- a path Step 6 marks sensitive.

If either is true, do NOT make that call under fast-tier discipline. Escalate to `quick` first:

1. **State the escalation, verbatim, naming the file.** For example: "Escalating from fast to quick — `docs/glossary.md` is outside the estimated file set `{README.md}`." State the specific sensitive path by name when that is the trigger instead — the sensitive-path condition fires independently of file count, even when the estimated set never grew past 1 file.
2. **Keep the edits already made.** Never revert an already-made edit solely because of the escalation.
3. **Record the done work.** Set `.claude/scratchpad.md`'s `## Tier: quick` and a `## Feature:` name, recording the already-touched file(s) as already-completed context — using `Edit` if the file already exists, `Write` only if it does not (see "The scratchpad-mutation idiom" below).
4. **Proceed under the quick tier** — Quick Tier Execution (FR-4) above — for the remainder of the work, with the already-touched file(s) included in the single slice's `Files:`/`Changes:` fields as work already done.

#### Quick → Full (FR-2.2)

While executing under Quick Tier Execution above, escalate to `full` — overriding whatever default behavior the triggering condition would otherwise have — when EITHER:
- **(a)** a Rule 4 condition (`src/rules/error-recovery.md` — architectural decision, new dependency, API contract change, schema migration) is encountered during the TDD cycle. At `quick` tier this redirects to `full` instead of Rule 4's default "stop implementation, present to user" behavior — do NOT stop and ask; OR
- **(b)** an `Edit`/`Write` call about to be made — checked BEFORE issuing it, exactly as the fast→quick trigger above requires — would target a path Step 6 marks sensitive, or would bring the count of distinct files touched by this run's own `Edit`/`Write` calls above 3.

Condition (b) exists because Step 2's mechanical full-forcing signals are otherwise enforced at classification time only — a `quick`-tier change ("add a missing validation" is the canonical case) can sprawl mid-run into exactly the territory that would have forced `full` had it been visible up front, and Phase 0's one-time classification has no mechanism to catch that on its own.

Mechanics, once either condition fires:

1. **State the escalation, verbatim, naming the specific condition that fired.** For example: "Escalating from quick to full — this fix requires adding a new npm dependency, a Rule 4 condition," or "...— `middleware/auth.js` is a sensitive path," or "...— this run has now touched 4 distinct files."
2. **Keep the quick-tier commit(s).** Any already-committed `quick`-tier slice commit remains in place, never reverted.
3. **Rewrite the tier field — the very first tool call after the escalation statement.** Use `Edit` (see "The scratchpad-mutation idiom" below) to change `.claude/scratchpad.md`'s `## Tier:` field from `quick` to `full`, immediately, before any further gate or agent invocation. This ordering is load-bearing, not a style preference: without it, `/merge-ready`'s Tier Check preamble would read the stale `quick` value and silently run the reduced gate subset — skipping Gates 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 — on a feature this escalation requires to get all 9 gates; and `session:start:spine`'s state re-injection after a mid-run context compaction re-surfaces whatever the scratchpad currently says, so a deferred rewrite would let the pre-escalation `quick` value survive the very mechanism meant to restore correct state after a compaction.
4. **Invoke `/bootstrap-feature`** for the full, now-larger scope, supplying the already-completed work as context, so `prd-writer`/`ba-analyst`/`architect`/`qa-planner` document it accurately rather than purely prospectively.
5. **`planner` marks the already-satisfied slice DONE** with its existing commit hash in the resulting plan — never re-implemented.
6. **Proceed through the remaining slices and an unmodified, full 9-gate `/merge-ready`** (Phase 3) — indistinguishable at completion from a request classified `full` from the start, because step 3 already made `/merge-ready` read `## Tier: full` exactly as it would have from the start.

#### `full` is the escalation ceiling (FR-2.5)

A Rule 4 condition encountered while already at `full` tier retains today's unmodified behavior: stop implementation, present to the user, and count against the retry budget. There is no higher tier to redirect to — the quick→full redirect in condition (a) above applies only to a run currently at `quick`, never to a run already at `full`.

#### No automatic downgrade, ever (FR-2.6)

Once a tier is assigned — by Phase 0 Triage (Steps 2-6 above) or by either escalation above — it MUST NOT be automatically lowered for the remainder of that run, regardless of what later evaluation of actual scope suggests. No automatic downgrade, ever: a tier must never be automatically lowered or silently reverted back toward `fast`/`quick` mid-run, no matter how small the remaining work turns out to be in hindsight. A `quick`-tier run that turns out to touch only 1 file, or a `full`-tier run whose plan turns out to be a single slice, completes at the tier it is already running under — never re-triage mid-run, and never report a gate `SKIPPED` for tier reasons on a run that was never actually at that lower tier. This is not a corollary of "escalation is one-way" — it is its own rule because it is the property that makes escalation safe to build at all: an automatic downgrade is how a feature that legitimately needed full documentation would quietly lose it, mid-run, with nobody having asked for that. The only way to run below what Phase 0 Triage would currently assign is an explicit, human-invoked `/sdlc-fast`/`/sdlc-quick` override issued before the run starts — never a pipeline decision taken mid-run.

#### The scratchpad-mutation idiom: Edit, never a whole-file Write

Every mutation of an **existing** `.claude/scratchpad.md` — the quick→full tier rewrite above, the fast→quick tier/plan initialization above when the file already exists, and `planner`'s DONE-with-commit-hash recording — MUST use **Edit, never a whole-file Write**. Reason: `pre:write:shrink-guard` fires on `Write` only, curates `.claude/scratchpad.md` among a small set of other files, and denies a `Write` whose new content falls below `max(floor(old_lines × 0.4), 40)` lines. A small `quick`-tier scratchpad written with `Write` over a large, pre-existing one (carrying, say, a prior feature's `## Completed` history) would be denied mid-escalation — and its sole escape, `SDLC_ALLOW_SHRINK=1`, is an environment variable this pipeline has no mechanism to set mid-session, which would dead-end exactly the escalation NFR-1(b) forbids from dead-ending. This idiom applies only when `.claude/scratchpad.md` already exists. A brand-new scratchpad written where none exists at all — the genuine first-ever-feature case — is a `Write` of a nonexistent file, outside the guard's scope by construction; that case, and only that case, legitimately uses `Write`.

### Phase 1: Bootstrap (Documentation)
Follow the `/bootstrap-feature` workflow for the requested feature.
This produces: PRD section, use-case document, architecture review, QA test cases, implementation plan, feature branch, and initialized scratchpad.

### Phase 1.5: Implementation Review
After the plan is created by the Tech Lead:
- **Architect** reviews slices flagged for architectural complexity — validates technical design for each
- **Security Engineer** (security-auditor) reviews slices touching auth, financial data, or external APIs — flags security requirements
- Incorporate review feedback into slice implementation notes in the scratchpad

### Phase 2: Implement All Slices (Wave-Aware)

Read `.claude/scratchpad.md` to identify the current wave and its pending slices. Process waves in order (Wave 1 → Wave 2 → ... → Wave N).

**Tracer gate (checked before dispatching Wave 1, and enforced at every subsequent wave transition — applies identically to the single-slice direct path and the multi-slice parallel path below):**

Check whether the plan contains a slice marked `**Tracer:** yes`.

- **If it does:** no slice other than the tracer may be dispatched until the tracer slice's `Verify:` condition has been run and has passed. The wave-advance condition is explicit: Wave N+1 dispatches only after every Wave N slice's `Verify:` has been run and has passed — this holds for both dispatch paths below. A slice merely being committed, or an implementation attempt merely having been made, is NOT sufficient to advance the wave; only a passing `Verify:` result is. This is deliberate: "committed" or "attempted" is not sufficient — that gap is exactly how a broken tracer could slip through the single-slice direct path (which has no parallel-subagent result-collection step to catch it).
- **Tracer failure halts the phase:** if the tracer slice's `Verify:` condition still fails after the existing 3-retry budget (`error-recovery.md`) is exhausted, halt Phase 2 before dispatching any expansion-slice work — single or parallel — and escalate through the existing Rule 3 / Rule 4 error-recovery path. Do NOT proceed to Slice 2 (or any later slice) with the tracer left broken.
- **If the plan carries no `**Tracer:** yes` marker anywhere** (a legacy, pre-F3 plan), print this line verbatim before proceeding to any slice:

  `tracer gate inactive — no **Tracer:** yes marker found; treating as pre-F3 plan.`

  Then proceed exactly as before this feature shipped — a plan with no tracer marker executes in its existing slice order with no tracer-gate applied. This notice makes the fallback visible rather than silent; it MUST always accompany the fallback, never be omitted, even though the run itself is unaffected.

**Single-slice wave (or no `Wave:` fields in plan):**
Follow the `/implement-slice` workflow directly — identical to current sequential behavior. Invoke `/implement-slice` WITH the `no-changelog` suppression flag so that even this direct, no-wave-context path does NOT write a CHANGELOG.md entry — the single feature changelog entry is owned by merge-ready (see Phase 3).

**Multi-slice wave (2+ pending slices in same wave):**

**Dispatch-time write-surface disjointness check — run this immediately before issuing any `Agent` tool call for a wave with 2+ pending slices:**
- Re-derive that wave's slices' `Files:` lists fresh from the plan file — re-read the plan file now; do NOT reuse `Files:` lists recalled from memory or from an earlier read in this session, since the plan may have been replanned or hand-edited since then.
- Check pairwise disjointness across those lists, always case-insensitively — do not attempt to detect whether the underlying filesystem is case-sensitive. A false conflict merely triggers the replan recovery path below, which is safe; a missed conflict corrupts a wave, which is not. Treat any `Files:` entry ending in a trailing slash as owning that entire directory subtree, so a path-prefix relationship (e.g. `src/handlers/` vs. `src/handlers/widgets.ts`) counts as a conflict too, not only an exact string match.
- **A single-slice wave requires no check** — there is nothing to conflict with. This step applies only when the wave has 2 or more pending slices; skip it entirely for single-slice waves.

**On conflict — refusal and recovery:**
- If any file path appears in 2 or more of the about-to-be-dispatched slices' `Files:` lists, refuse to dispatch this wave: issue ZERO `Agent` tool calls for it, and report the specific conflicting file path together with the slice numbers that both declare it.
- Recover immediately — this must never dead-end an unattended run. Treat it as a Rule 3 auto-resolve first: re-invoke `planner`, flagging the conflicting slice pair and the shared path, so it can rewave the offending slice into a later wave or split file ownership so the lists no longer overlap. Re-derive the (now-revised) wave's `Files:` lists fresh from the plan and re-check disjointness before dispatching.
- Only escalate to Rule 4 if `planner` cannot resolve the conflict automatically after the Rule 3 attempt.

Once the wave's slices are confirmed disjoint (or the wave has only 1 slice), spawn parallel subagents — one Agent tool call per slice in a single message:

```
For each pending slice in the current wave, spawn an Agent with this prompt:

"You are implementing Slice [N]: [description].
Follow the /implement-slice TDD workflow for this slice ONLY.

Slice specification:
- Wave: [W] (sibling slices: [list])
- Files: [files]
- Changes: [changes]
- Verify: [verify command]
- Done when: [condition]

CRITICAL RULES FOR PARALLEL EXECUTION:
1. Do NOT write to .claude/scratchpad.md — the orchestrator handles scratchpad updates
2. Do NOT auto-continue to the next slice — return to the orchestrator after committing
3. Chain git commands: git add <files> && git commit -m '...' (single command to prevent staging conflicts)
4. Read the project's CLAUDE.md at .claude/CLAUDE.md for conventions
5. This slice runs under a `no-changelog` suppression flag — do NOT write a CHANGELOG.md entry. The single feature changelog entry is owned by merge-ready (Phase 3)
6. Do NOT write to .claude/instincts.md — the orchestrator captures instincts after collecting the wave's results

Report your result: PASS (with commit hash) or FAIL (with error details) — this existing PASS/FAIL requirement is extended, not replaced, by the fields below.

In addition to PASS/FAIL, you MUST also report:
- **Deviation-rule fires as `(category, count)` pairs** — e.g. `(rule1, 1) (rule3, 2)` — covering every fire of `src/rules/error-recovery.md` Rules 1-4 during this slice's implementation, across every attempt, not only the final one.
- **Any detected user corrections** (Trigger 1 heuristics) received mid-slice.
- **Your final `Slice [N] build-runner attempts: N/3` count.**

Why this matters: Rule 1 and Rule 2 fires are **free** — they cost no retry budget and are therefore invisible in any retry count you report. Without the `(category, count)` pairs, the orchestrator would never learn a rule fired twice in your slice. And the tally these numbers feed lives in `.claude/scratchpad.md`, which you cannot write — it is itself `PROTECTED` (Rule 1 above) — so reporting-then-folding is the only channel through which this information reaches it. Without the attempts count specifically, the `2/3` debugger-trigger threshold has no durable input at all on this parallel path."
```

After all subagents complete:
1. **Collect results** — which slices succeeded (commit hashes), which failed (errors), and each subagent's reported `(category, count)` deviation pairs, detected corrections, and final `Slice [N] build-runner attempts: N/3` count
2. **Fold deviation fires into the per-feature tally** — for every reported `(category, count)` pair from every sibling in the wave, `Edit` `.claude/scratchpad.md`'s `Deviation rule fires this feature: rule1=<n> rule2=<n> rule3=<n> rule4=<n>` line, adding each reported count onto the existing per-rule total (never overwriting it). **Reconciliation clause (verbatim):** two fires of the same rule **within a single slice** count exactly as two fires across two siblings, and fires from earlier waves carry forward into the same feature-level tally — without this, a two-fires-in-one-slice wave captures under neither threshold. Then persist each sibling's reported `Slice [N] build-runner attempts: N/3` count into `.claude/scratchpad.md` via `Edit`.
3. **Capture Trigger 2 and Trigger 3 instincts — orchestrator-only writes:** after folding, write one instinct entry per pattern per feature for Trigger 2 (any deviation-rule category whose folded tally now stands at `2` or more) and for Trigger 3 (any sibling slice whose reported attempts count reached an exhausted budget, i.e. `3/3`, with the underlying check still FAILing) — mirroring Trigger 3's existing coverage, extended here to wave failures. No wave subagent ever writes `.claude/instincts.md` (Rule 6 above); this write belongs to the orchestrator alone.
4. **Update scratchpad** — mark succeeded slices DONE with commit hashes, mark failed slices with FAILED and reason. Update `## Status:` to reflect current wave progress
5. **Handle failures** (per error-recovery parallel wave rules):
   - All succeeded → proceed to next wave
   - Some failed → keep successful sibling commits (independent files), report failures, ask user: retry / continue / abort
   - All failed → report as blocker, stop

**Continue until all waves show complete in the scratchpad.**

**Backward compatibility:** When slices have no `Wave:` fields, treat each slice as its own wave — sequential execution, identical to current behavior.

### Phase 2.5: Code Cleanup (if 4+ slices were implemented)
Delegate to `refactor-cleaner` agent to review the accumulated changes:
- **Step 0**: Remove dead code, unused imports, and debug logs first — verify typecheck passes on the clean baseline before proceeding
- Consolidate duplicated patterns across slices
- Improve type safety where obvious
Then commit cleanup as a single `chore(core): clean up <feature> implementation` commit.

### Phase 3: Quality Gates
Follow the `/merge-ready` workflow to run all quality gates.
- **Changelog**: the single `CHANGELOG.md` entry for the feature is written here by merge-ready — NOT by any individual slice. Each slice ran under the `no-changelog` suppression flag, so merge-ready is the sole owner of the feature changelog entry.
- If any gate FAILS: the main agent reads the gate's output and fixes the issues directly, then reruns only the failed gate(s) — **except** that any fix which produced a commit invalidates the earlier Gate 2 and Gate 3 passes, so those two re-run over the new commits. This is what stops Gate 6's `--gaps` replan loop from committing code that no reviewer ever inspects.
- Repeat until all gates pass OR 3 fix attempts exhausted per gate
- Output final MERGE READY / NOT MERGE READY verdict

## Rules

- NEVER stop to ask the user unless truly stuck (3 retries exhausted on a critical blocker)
- NEVER skip PRD, Use Cases, or QA documentation steps
- ALWAYS update scratchpad after each slice (enforced by scratchpad rule)
- ALWAYS commit each slice atomically (1 slice = 1 commit)
- NEVER add "Co-Authored-By" or AI attribution
