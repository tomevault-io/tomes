description: Detect staleness, bloat, dead references, duplicated facts, and false-positive triggers across the project's scaffolding (CLAUDE.md, .dev/, .claude/, scripts/). Trigger when scaffolding feels off, after large refactors, after many ROADMAP edits, before release tags, or when the user explicitly asks for a scaffolding audit. Produces a report; does not modify files. Use when this capability is needed.

# audit_scaffolding

Audit the *scaffolding* (everything that supports the code, but
isn't the code itself) for the four common rot patterns:

1. **Staleness** — references to files / SHAs / phases / sections
   that no longer exist or no longer match reality.
2. **Bloat** — files past their soft limit, or duplicated facts that
   have started to drift between copies.
3. **Lies** — absolute statements ("we always X", "never Y") that
   reality has overtaken.
4. **False positives** — gate triggers / `.claude/rules/*.md` path
   matchers that fire on commits or files where they shouldn't.

The full check list, grouped by category, lives in
[`CHECKS.md`](./CHECKS.md) next to this file. Read it when running
the audit.

## When to invoke

This skill is **on demand** — nothing fires it automatically (ADR-0212 D5
records what was retired and why). Its mechanized half is a script you can
run any time:

```sh
bash scripts/audit_blocked_by_age.sh          # >14d WARN, >30d STALE
bash scripts/audit_blocked_by_age.sh --gate   # exit 1 on any STALE row
```

Narrow mode (§F debt-coherence checks only) is still the right shape when
that script reports STALE rows and you want the barriers re-walked.

Invoke this skill when:

- The scaffolding feels off — an ADR cites a section that has moved,
  a rule contradicts CLAUDE.md, etc.
- A large refactor or architectural shift has just landed.
- ROADMAP has been amended (per §18) several times in a row.
- A release tag is about to be cut.
- The user explicitly says "audit scaffolding" / "check for drift" /
  similar.

A `blocked-by` row whose barrier quietly disappeared goes unnoticed until
someone looks; `scripts/audit_blocked_by_age.sh` is what looks. In the other
direction, local-optimisation drift (audit-fix-audit-fix at the expense of the
actual work) is a failure mode this skill can flag — keep an eye on whether the
audit is helping or hindering.

## Procedure

### Run inline by default; delegate only when scope is large

CHECKS.md is mostly grep / `test -e` / `git cat-file` — each check
finishes in milliseconds. **Default to inline** (batched parallel
`Bash` calls in the main agent). Subagent fork pays a context-handover
overhead (~30-60 s spin-up plus completion) that exceeds the savings
unless the audit is genuinely large.

**Delegate to a subagent only when** any of:

- ROADMAP has had >5 amendments since the last audit (A.4 walk
  becomes proportional to commit count).
- The audit is expected to surface >500 lines of finding text
  (so the parent context shouldn't absorb it).
- A specific deep-dive across `.dev/decisions/` is in scope.

For Phase 0–6 routine boundary audits, inline is the right choice.
The §9.0 / 0.6 boundary measured ~3 minutes via subagent vs.
~1 minute estimated inline.

### Steps

1. Read [`CHECKS.md`](./CHECKS.md). It groups checks by category and
   gives the exact command for each.
2. Run the checks in order. For each finding, classify severity:
   - **block** — must fix before next commit (false positive in
     gate, dead link in CLAUDE.md).
   - **soon** — fix in the next iteration (bloat over soft limit,
     drifted duplication).
   - **watch** — note for later (approaching limit, weak signal).
3. Produce a report at `private/audit-YYYY-MM-DD.md` with three
   sections (block / soon / watch), each finding cited with
   file:line.
4. Summarise to the user in 5–10 lines:
   - Total findings (block / soon / watch counts)
   - Top 3 most important findings (one line each)
   - Whether to fix now or queue for later
5. The audit itself does not modify files; the user (or a follow-up
   commit) does the fixes. Where a fix is local and obvious, the
   `continue` skill may apply it inline before resuming the loop.

## Output format

```
# Scaffolding audit — YYYY-MM-DD

## block (N)
- <file:line> — <one-line description>
  fix: <one-line suggestion>

## soon (N)
- <file:line> — <description> (fix: ...)

## watch (N)
- <file:line> — <description>

## summary
<2-3 sentence read of overall health>
```

## Why this exists

Scaffolding rot is the failure mode that LLM-driven development is
most prone to: docs and rules accumulate, become contradictory, and
the agent stops trusting any of them. By making the audit an
explicit-when-needed step (rather than hoping to notice in passing),
drift is caught when it actually matters and fixed before it
confuses the next session.

The complementary failure mode is **over-auditing** — running the
audit so often that the project never advances. The adaptive
cadence (above) is the corrective.

## Bridge to `meta_audit`

`audit_scaffolding` checks scaffolding **integrity** (dead refs,
bloat, lies, false positives). When integrity-side findings hint
at deeper **correctness** drift (Phase scope mismatch, ADR
honesty, §14 silent crosses), `CHECKS.md §J` emits `suggest
meta_audit` findings. The user reads them at the next resume and
decides whether to fire `.claude/skills/meta_audit/SKILL.md`
(user-gated; not autonomous).
