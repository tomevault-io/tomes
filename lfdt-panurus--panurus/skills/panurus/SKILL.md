# Debugging Integration Tests

This doc is the single source of truth. In Claude Code it is also exposed as the
`/debug-integration-tests` skill via a symlink at
`.claude/skills/debug-integration-tests/SKILL.md`.

## Running Integration Tests: `TEST_FILTER` Labels

`TEST_FILTER` is a Ginkgo `--label-filter` expression, and it can combine **two
independent kinds of label** with `&&`:

1. **Test-identifying labels** (`T1`, `T2`, `T2.1`, `T3`, ...) — identify the
   scenario itself, set via `Label("T1")` on the individual `It(...)` block
   (e.g. `integration/token/fungible/dlog/dlog_test.go`).
2. **Infrastructure-type labels** (`websocket`, `libp2p`, `replicas`) — identify
   the transport/replication configuration the scenario runs under, defined in
   `integration/ports.go` (`WebSocketNoReplication`, `LibP2PNoReplication`,
   `WebSocketWithReplication`). Suites that call `fungible.TestAll` loop over
   `integration.AllTestTypes` and wrap every `Describe` in the matching infra
   label, so a filter of just `T1` runs T1 once per infra type sequentially.

Combine them to pin a scenario to one infrastructure type:

```bash
make integration-tests-dlog-fabric TEST_FILTER="T1 && websocket"
make integration-tests-fabricx-dlog TEST_FILTER="T6 && libp2p"
```

`fungible.mk` and `fabricx.mk` already expose make targets for the common
combos, e.g. `integration-tests-dlog-fabric-t1-websocket`, `-t1-libp2p`,
`-t1-replicas` (CI uses these to run the three infra configurations as
parallel jobs). The plain `-tN` targets (no infra suffix, e.g.
`integration-tests-dlog-fabric-t1`) leave the infra label unset and run all
three types sequentially.

**Local default: websocket only.** Unless the user asks for `libp2p`,
`replicas`, or "all infra types", always add `&& websocket` (or use an
existing `-websocket` make target) when running integration tests locally.
The other two configurations are far more expensive to set up locally and
are already covered by CI's parallel per-infra jobs.

## Log Locations
- **Integration Tests**: System temp directory (`/tmp/fsc-integration-<random>/...`)
- **Containers**: `docker logs <container_name>`
- **Persisted Logs**: Temporarily modify test to use `NewLocalTestSuite` (outputs to `./testdata`)
- **CI**: For a failing PR, fetch the failed jobs' logs from the most recent failed CI run
  with `ci/scripts/get-pr-failed-logs.sh <PR_NUMBER> [REPO]` (requires `gh` authenticated).
  It saves one cleaned, timestamp-stripped log file per failed job under
  `pr_<PR_NUMBER>_failed_logs/`.

## Debugging Techniques
- **Manual Inspection**: Use `time.Sleep()` or pause loops in tests to inspect Docker state
- **Network Preservation**: Check for `no-cleanup` option or manually comment test suite cleanup
- **Focused Tests**: Modify `It(...)` to `FIt(...)` to focus, or `XIt(...)` to skip (never commit these changes)
