# Maintenance & API evolution

> **CRITICAL: Before EVERY `git commit`, verify the message matches `^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert)(\(.+\))?!?: .+`. If not, rewrite it. No exceptions.**
>
> **CRITICAL: Before EVERY PR title creation, verify the title matches the same pattern. `lint-pr-title.yml` enforces this in CI — PRs with non-conforming titles are blocked.**

## Public API surface

The public API is **what `pytrendy/__init__.py` exports** plus the `detect_trends()` signature:

```python
from pytrendy import detect_trends, load_data, plot_pytrendy, dtw
```

- `detect_trends(df, date_col, value_col, plot=True, method_params=None, debug=False)` → `PyTrendyResults`
- `load_data(name)` — `name` ∈ `{'series_synthetic', 'classes_signals'}` (CSVs in `pytrendy/io/data/`)
- `plot_pytrendy(...)` — annotated visualization
- `dtw` — re-exported from `pytrendy.simpledtw`

`PyTrendyResults` (from `pytrendy.io.results_pytrendy`) is the return type: `.print_summary()`, filtering by direction/rank, tabular segment access.

**Changing any of these is user-observable.** Internal helpers in `post_processing/`, `process_signals.py`, `simpledtw.py` are not public API — restructure freely with `refactor:`.

## Deprecation policy (the rule agents get wrong)

| Situation | Commit type | Version bump | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| Parameter still works but deprecated (soft) | `feat:` | minor | `warnings.warn(..., DeprecationWarning)` + keep accepting the old name |
| Parameter/behavior removed entirely (hard) | `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` | major | Remove the old code path |
| Internal restructure, zero public API impact | `refactor:` | none | No warning needed |

**Deprecating a public param is `feat:`, NOT `refactor:`** — even if the code change is a rename. Deprecation is a user-facing signal that triggers a minor bump and documents intent to remove in a future major. See `docs/contributing.md` "Deprecations" and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (now migrated here).

### Current live deprecation

`detect_trends(..., method_params=...)`: `is_abrupt_padded` is **deprecated** (raises `DeprecationWarning`, see `pytrendy/detect_trends.py:63`). Use `abrupt_padding` instead.

### Current `method_params` keys (the only ones honored)

```python
method_params = {
    'abrupt_padding': 0,      # int: days to pad around abrupt transitions
    'avoid_noise': True,      # bool: skip noisy segments
}
```

Any other keys passed are silently dropped — `detect_trends` reconstructs the dict from these two defaults (`pytrendy/detect_trends.py:72`). Don't add a third key without also updating this allowlist and the docstring.

## Code conventions

- **Docstrings**: Google style (mkdocstrings is configured for it in `mkdocs.yml`). Required on public functions.
- **Type hints** on all public function signatures.
- **No debug prints or commented-out code** in committed code. Use `debug=True` in `detect_trends` for dev plots/prints — that's what it's for.
- **Keep diffs minimal**: only touch lines directly relevant to the change. No stray reformatting, whitespace, blank-line, or indentation changes. These wreck reviews and cause merge conflicts. If something nearby is ugly, open a separate `refactor:` PR.
- Follow existing patterns in the module you're editing — don't import a new library when the module already uses something equivalent.

## Pipeline (don't break the order)

`detect_trends()` runs five stages in `pytrendy/detect_trends.py:77`:

1. `process_signals(df, value_col, method_params, debug)` — Savitzky-Golay smoothing, flat/noise flags.
2. `get_segments(df)` — contiguous segment extraction with min-length: Up/Down ≥3d, Flat/Noise ≥1d.
3. `refine_segments(df, value_col, segments, method_params)` — boundary adjust, DTW gradual/abrupt classification, abrupt shaving, grouping, artifact cleanup.
4. `analyse_segments(df, value_col, segments)` — metrics: total/percent change, duration, SNR, change rank.
5. `plot_pytrendy(df, value_col, segments)` — only if `plot=True`.

Each stage's output is the next stage's input. See the `pytrendy` skill for the module map.

## Segment schema (what tests assume)

Segment dicts have at minimum: `direction` ('Up'/'Down'/'Flat'/'Noise'), `start`, `end`. After `analyse_segments`, also: `days`, `total_change`, `change_rank`, `trend_class` ('gradual'/'abrupt'/NaN). Tests in `tests/conftest.py` assert on `direction`/`start`/`end` — changing the keys or values breaks the whole suite.

## Branch model (enforced by CI)

- **PRs target `develop`, not `main`.** `check-base-branch.yml` hard-fails otherwise. Only `develop`→`main` release PRs and automated `docs/whats-new-*` PRs bypass.
- `main` = stable release branch. `develop` = prerelease (`dev` channel).
- Branch off: `git checkout -b my-feature origin/develop`.

## Commits & PR titles (Conventional Commits, enforced)

- `lint-pr-title.yml` rejects titles not matching `^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert)(\(.+\))?!?: .+`.
- semantic-release maps: `feat`→minor, `fix`→patch, `!`/`BREAKING CHANGE:`→major, others→no bump.
- Deprecating a public API param = `feat:` (minor), *not* `refactor:` — see "Deprecation policy" section above.
- **`chore` vs `fix`**: `fix:` triggers a **patch release** via semantic-release. Use `chore:` or `ci:` for maintenance-only changes that have zero user-facing code impact. Using `fix:` on non-bugfix work causes accidental auto-releases.
- Imperative, lowercase, <72 chars, no trailing period.

## Don't touch these manually

- `pyproject.toml` version — bumped by semantic-release via `poetry version`. Editing it by hand breaks releases.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — generated by semantic-release on `main`.
- `docs/whats-new.md` — generated by the agentic `whats-new.yaml` workflow (OpenCode CLI writes between `<!-- WHATS_NEW_CONTENT_START/END -->` sentinels). Don't edit by hand unless explicitly directed to fix/regenerate an entry — the workflow overwrites content between the sentinels on the next release.

## Issues and PRs

When creating issues or PRs, follow the conventions in `docs/contributing.md`:

- **Issue titles** use `[Tag] Short description` format: `[Bug]`, `[Docs]`, `[Enhancement]`, `[Feature]`, `[CI]`, `[Maintenance]`
- **PR titles** follow Conventional Commits: `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, etc. (same as commit messages)
- **Link issues** in PR descriptions with `Closes #<number>`
- **Labels** apply appropriate labels: `bug`, `documentation`, `enhancement`, `feature`, `test`, `maintenance`, `good first issue`, `priority`

## Remote session behaviour

**Detecting CI environment:** When `PYTRENDY_CI=true` is set, you are running in a GitHub Actions environment, not a local interactive session.

### Environment constraints

- Agent runs in a GitHub Actions runner, not the user's machine
- Git identity, credentials, and write permissions are constrained by the runner
- Cannot assume interactive capabilities — must act or fail, not ask for confirmation

### Confirmation loop avoidance

- When the user gives an explicit instruction (e.g. "create an issue", "fix this", "commit"), execute it directly
- **Safety assessment:** Before executing, evaluate the action:
  - If safe and clearly scoped (e.g. "add a comment", "create a branch") → execute immediately
  - If the prompt clearly matches the action → execute immediately
  - If wildly out of scope or dangerous from a git perspective → **do not execute**, and explain why. Dangerous actions include:
    - Committing directly to `main` or `develop`
    - Force-pushing
    - Deleting branches
    - Any operation that could affect the release pipeline

### Auth loop detection

- If the same write operation fails with the same auth/permission error **3 or more times consecutively** (same command, same error output), **stop the session immediately**
- Post a final comment summarising: what was attempted, the exact error each time, and why it couldn't be completed
- Do NOT retry blindly — repeated identical failures indicate a permission/scope issue, not a transient error
- The user must fix the underlying permission before re-triggering
