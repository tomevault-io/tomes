name: import-x-history
description: Imports an X (Twitter) account's post history in bulk through x.pcstyle.dev: hundreds to thousands of posts in one request, replies and reposts included, raw JSON or a streamed NDJSON feed, with per-account archiving so repeat imports return in under a second. Use when onboarding a user from their X handle, building a writing-style or memory profile from someone's posts, or when you need more than one page of an account's timeline. No key needed; a key raises the import allowance. Read-only. Use when this capability is needed.

# import x history

one request, one handle, as much history as you ask for. base URL `https://x.pcstyle.dev` (`https://mdfromx.com` is the same service). no key is needed: anonymous imports are metered per address, **10 per 15 minutes**. a key lifts that to **60 per 15 minutes per key**; send it as:

```
Authorization: Bearer $XMD_FAST_KEY
```

if the key is in the environment as `XMD_FAST_KEY`, use it and never print it. a self-hosted deployment in private mode (`X_MD_REQUIRE_API_KEY`) answers `401 unauthorized` without one.

## the one call you need

```bash
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $XMD_FAST_KEY" \
  "https://x.pcstyle.dev/api/v1/profiles/paulg/posts?since=2025-09-01&max_posts=2000"
```

response: `{ "profile": {...}, "posts": [...], "meta": {...} }`

- `posts` — newest first, raw upstream fields untouched: `id`, `text`, `created_at`, `author`, `replying_to`, `quote`, `reposted_by`, `media`, `poll`, `likes`, `replies`, `retweets`, `quotes`, `views`, `bookmarks`, `url`
- `meta.count`, `meta.oldest`, `meta.newest` — what you got
- `meta.truncated` — `true` when the range held more than `max_posts`; to continue send `until=<meta.oldest>` and drop the one post you already have (dedupe by `id`)
- `meta.floor_reached` — `true` when X's ~3200-entry timeline limit was hit; nothing older exists upstream
- `meta.archive.served` / `.added` — how many came from the archive vs a fresh walk

## parameters

| param | default | use |
|---|---|---|
| `since` | — | oldest post, `2025-01-01` / ISO datetime / unix seconds. omit for everything available |
| `until` | now | newest post, inclusive |
| `max_posts` | 500 | up to 5000, newest first |
| `with_replies` | true | the account's replies (tone, opinions, short-form style) |
| `with_reposts` | true | reposts come back as the original post with `reposted_by` set and the original's date |
| `only_replies` | false | replies only |
| `format` | json | `ndjson` streams `{"post":…}` lines as they arrive, then one `{"meta":…,"profile":…}` line (or `{"error":…}`) |
| `concurrency` | 16 | up to 32; lower it on `503 upstream_rate_limited` |
| `refresh` | false | re-walk the range for fresh engagement counts instead of serving the archive |
| `index` | false | `true` returns only what is archived for the handle. free, no walk |

## the archive, and how to use it well

the service stores what it walks per handle. the next import of that handle only fetches the gap (newer than the archive, or older when `since` moves back), then serves everything from the archive. that is why:

- a first import of 2000 posts takes ~10–15 s; the same request again takes <1 s
- for an onboarding slider (3 months → 1 year → everything), just call again with the wider `since`; only the extra months are walked
- check `?index=true` first when you only need to know whether history exists and how far back it goes:

```bash
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $XMD_FAST_KEY" \
  "https://x.pcstyle.dev/api/v1/profiles/paulg/posts?index=true"
# {"handle":"paulg","archive":{"count":1166,"oldest":"…","newest":"…","covered_since":"…","covered_until":"…","floor_reached":false,…},"persistent":true}
```

archived posts keep the engagement counts from when they were stored. pass `refresh=true` when likes/views must be current.

## streaming, when you render as you go

```bash
curl -sN -H "Authorization: Bearer $XMD_FAST_KEY" \
  "https://x.pcstyle.dev/api/v1/profiles/paulg/posts?since=2026-01-01&format=ndjson"
```

archived posts stream first (instantly), fresh ones follow. lines are unsorted; the trailing `meta` line means the walk finished. the stream carries the first `max_posts` to arrive, not the newest.

## limits and errors

- imports are metered on their own: **10 per 15 minutes per address** without a key (`import-ip` in `RateLimit-Policy`), **60 per 15 minutes per key** with one (`import-key`); one unit per import however many posts it returns. `index=true` is free
- every response carries `RateLimit` / `RateLimit-Policy`; pace against them instead of discovering `429`
- errors are RFC 9457 problem JSON with a machine `code`:
  - `401 unauthorized` — bad key, or no key on a private-mode deployment
  - `400 invalid_option` — bad date, `since` ≥ `until`, or a count out of range
  - `404 not_found` — unknown, suspended or protected account
  - `429 rate_limited` — wait `Retry-After` seconds
  - `503 upstream_rate_limited` — every upstream is throttling; wait `Retry-After`, or retry with a lower `concurrency`
- a 2000-post cold import can take up to ~20 s; use `format=ndjson` if a blank wait is a problem

## what else is there

the same base URL (and key, if you have one) works on the rest of the read API — a single post or thread (`/api/v1/posts?url=…`), a profile page with `limit` up to 100 (`/api/v1/profiles/{handle}?with_replies=true&limit=100&format=json`), search with `since`/`until` (`/api/v1/search?q=…`), followers/following. full reference: `https://x.pcstyle.dev/openapi.json`, guide: `https://x.pcstyle.dev/docs/bulk-import`.

read-only: this never posts, follows, or reads protected accounts, DMs or Lists.
