## Skills TUI Application

The `skills-tui` directory contains a production-ready Terminal User Interface (TUI) application for browsing, filtering, and managing Claude Skills.

### Quick Start

```bash
cd skills-tui

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run the TUI
cargo run -- /path/to/skills
```

### Features

- **3-Pane Layout**: Navigate skills (left), view details (right), see status (bottom)
- **Installation**: Install skills to Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or download as ZIP
- **Search & Filter**: Find skills by name or description
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Test Coverage**: 12 comprehensive tests with 100% pass rate

### Keybindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate skills |
| `i` | Install to Claude Code |
| `d` | Prepare for Claude Desktop |
| `z` | Download as ZIP |
| `f` | Toggle filter |
| `q` | Quit |

### Development

All functionality is built using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific test suite
cargo test --test discovery_test
cargo test --test install_test
cargo test --test zip_test
```

### Technology Stack

- **Ratatui 0.27**: Modern TUI framework
- **Crossterm 0.27**: Terminal backend
- **Serde**: YAML parsing for SKILL.md
- **Zip 0.6**: Archive creation
- **Walkdir**: Directory traversal

For detailed documentation, see [`skills-tui/README.md`](./skills-tui/README.md)

## Skill Structure

Each skill must follow this structure:

### Required Files
- `skills/skill-name/SKILL.md` - The main skill file with frontmatter and instructions

### Optional Directories
- `skills/skill-name/resources/` - Supporting documentation (reference.md, examples.md, etc.)
- `skills/skill-name/templates/` - Structured prompts or forms
- `skills/skill-name/scripts/` - Executable utilities (Python, Bash, etc.)

## SKILL.md Format

Every SKILL.md must include YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description of what the skill does and when to use it (max 1024 chars)
allowed-tools: Read, Edit, Bash  # Optional: restrict available tools
version: 1.0
---

# Skill Name

Main skill instructions here...
```

### Frontmatter Fields
- `name` (required): Lowercase, hyphenated identifier (max 64 chars)
- `description` (required): Third-person description of purpose and when to use (max 1024 chars)
- `allowed-tools` (optional): Comma-separated list of tools Claude can use with this skill
- `disabled-model-invocation` (optional): Set to true to prevent Claude from making API calls
- `version` (optional): Semantic version number

## Best Practices

### Content Organization
- **Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines** - use referenced files for additional content
- **Use progressive disclosure** - only load details when needed
- **Write concise metadata** - descriptions should be clear and objective
- **Include examples** - help Claude understand expected outputs

### Performance
- Only name/description (~100 tokens) is pre-loaded into Claude's context
- Full SKILL.md is loaded when Claude determines the skill is relevant
- Additional resources are loaded only when referenced
- Include executable scripts for computationally-intensive operations

### Testing
- Test skills with representative tasks before committing
- Include minimal, deterministic test scripts when appropriate
- Use pre-commit hooks to validate skill structure

### Security
- Only reference trusted external resources
- Review all scripts before including
- Use allowed-tools to restrict capabilities when appropriate

## Common Bash Commands

### Testing Skills Locally
```bash
# Install skill to personal directory
cp -r skills/skill-name ~/.claude/skills/

# Install skill to project directory
cp -r skills/skill-name .claude/skills/

# Create a new skill
mkdir -p skills/new-skill
touch skills/new-skill/SKILL.md
```

### Building and Packaging
```bash
# Create zip for Claude Desktop
cd skills/skill-name
zip -r ../../skill-name.zip .

# Validate skill structure
test -f skills/skill-name/SKILL.md && echo "Valid" || echo "Missing SKILL.md"
```

### Git Operations
```bash
# Add new skill
git add skills/new-skill/
git commit -m "Add new-skill for [purpose]"
git push

# Update existing skill
git add skills/skill-name/
git commit -m "Update skill-name: [changes]"
git push
```

## Importing Skills

### Claude Code (CLI)
```bash
# For project-level access
cp -r skills/skill-name .claude/skills/

# For personal/global access
cp -r skills/skill-name ~/.claude/skills/
```

Skills are automatically discovered on next session.

### Claude Desktop
1. Create a `.zip` file of the skill directory:
   ```bash
   cd skills/skill-name
   zip -r skill-name.zip .
   ```
2. Open Claude Desktop → Settings → Capabilities → Skills
3. Click "Upload skill" and select the .zip file

### Via Plugin (Team Distribution)
If distributing to a team, create a plugin that includes skills in its `skills/` directory.

## Development Workflow

1. **Create skill structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p skills/my-skill/resources
   touch skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
   ```

2. **Write SKILL.md with frontmatter**
   - Include clear name and description
   - Add detailed instructions
   - Reference additional resources as needed

3. **Test locally**
   ```bash
   cp -r skills/my-skill ~/.claude/skills/
   # Test in Claude Code
   ```

4. **Commit and push**
   ```bash
   git add skills/my-skill/
   git commit -m "Add my-skill for [purpose]"
   git push
   ```

5. **Share with team**
   - Team members clone/pull repository
   - Copy skills to their `.claude/skills/` directory

## Hooks

This repository may include Claude Code hooks in `.claude/hooks/`:

- **SessionStart**: Loads development context on startup
- **PreToolUse**: Validates tool usage before execution
- **Stop**: Ensures work is complete before stopping

Configure hooks in `.claude/settings.json` or user settings.

## Core Files

- `CLAUDE.md` - This file, repository documentation for Claude
- `README.md` - User-facing documentation
- `skills/*/SKILL.md` - Individual skill definitions
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore patterns

## Code Style Guidelines

### SKILL.md Content
- Use third-person descriptions in frontmatter
- Write clear, actionable instructions
- Include specific examples
- Keep main file under 500 lines
- Reference external files for supplemental content

### Directory Naming
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `skill-name`
- Be descriptive: `markdown-formatter` not `formatter`
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood

### Commit Messages
- Format: `Add/Update/Remove skill-name: brief description`
- Examples:
  - `Add markdown-formatter: format markdown files per style guide`
  - `Update contract-reviewer: add payment terms checklist`
  - `Remove outdated-skill: superseded by new-skill`

## Testing Instructions

### Validating Skill Structure
```bash
# Check required files exist
for skill in skills/*/; do
  if [ ! -f "$skill/SKILL.md" ]; then
    echo "Missing SKILL.md in $skill"
  fi
done
```

### Testing Frontmatter
```bash
# Check frontmatter exists
for skill in skills/*/SKILL.md; do
  if ! head -n 1 "$skill" | grep -q "^---$"; then
    echo "Missing frontmatter in $skill"
  fi
done
```

### Manual Testing
1. Copy skill to `~/.claude/skills/`
2. Start Claude Code session
3. Request a task that should trigger the skill
4. Verify skill is loaded and instructions are followed
5. Test edge cases and error handling

## Repository Conventions

- All skills must be in `skills/` directory
- Each skill has its own subdirectory
- SKILL.md is the required entry point
- Use `resources/`, `templates/`, and `scripts/` for organization
- Document dependencies in skill's SKILL.md
- Include version numbers in frontmatter
- Update this CLAUDE.md when adding new conventions

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Loading
- Verify SKILL.md exists and has valid frontmatter
- Check name matches directory name
- Ensure description is present and under 1024 characters
- Confirm proper YAML formatting in frontmatter

### Skill Not Triggering
- Description may not clearly indicate when to use
- Consider making description more specific
- Test with explicit user request mentioning skill name

### Performance Issues
- SKILL.md may be too large (keep under 500 lines)
- Move detailed content to referenced files
- Use scripts for computationally-intensive operations
