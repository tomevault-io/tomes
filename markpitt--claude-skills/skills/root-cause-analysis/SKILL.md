# Root Cause Analysis Orchestration Skill

This skill helps you systematically identify the root cause of any problem using proven methodologies from the Toyota Production System and other industry-standard techniques.

## Quick Reference: When to Load Which Resource

| Your Problem Type | Load Resource | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Need to understand 5 Whys, Fishbone, Pareto, Fault Tree methodology | `resources/rca-methodologies.md` | Learn each method step-by-step with examples |
| Looking for common root causes in your domain | `resources/common-root-causes.md` | Pattern match against known causes: software, hardware, process, personal |
| Want to see complete worked examples | `resources/example-analyses.md` | Study real cases: software bugs, vehicle maintenance, system failures, personal problems |
| Advanced: need barrier analysis, complex cause mapping | `resources/advanced-techniques.md` | Formal methods: Fault Tree, Barrier Analysis, multi-methodology chains |

## Core Principle

**Do not treat symptoms—find and fix the root cause.** As Taiichi Ohno, architect of the Toyota Production System, said: "By repeating why five times, the nature of the problem as well as its solution becomes clear."

## Orchestration Protocol

### Phase 1: Problem Classification

Quickly identify your problem domain and complexity:

**Problem Domain:**
- **Software**: Code bugs, system failures, performance, deployment
- **Hardware**: Equipment, mechanical, electrical, maintenance
- **Process**: Workflow, procedures, organizational, communication
- **Personal**: Life challenges, productivity, habits, wellbeing

**Complexity Level:**
- **Simple**: Clear failure chain, 1-2 likely causes → Use 5 Whys
- **Complex**: Multiple possible causes, unknown scope → Start with Fishbone
- **Critical/Safety**: High stakes, needs rigor → Use Fault Tree
- **Multiple Issues**: Many competing problems → Use Pareto first

**Action:** Load appropriate resource file(s) based on classification.

### Phase 2: Methodology Selection

Based on problem type, select your approach:

| Situation | Recommended | Load |
|---|---|---|
| **Single clear failure** | 5 Whys | methodologies.md |
| **Complex/multiple possibilities** | Fishbone → 5 Whys | methodologies.md |
| **Competing priorities** | Pareto → 5 Whys | methodologies.md |
| **Safety/high-stakes** | Fault Tree | advanced-techniques.md |
| **Process breakdown** | Barrier Analysis | advanced-techniques.md |
| **Pattern matching** | Common causes + 5 Whys | common-root-causes.md |

### Phase 3: Execution & Verification

**During Analysis:**
1. Define problem clearly (What/Where/When/Impact)
2. Gather evidence systematically
3. Apply selected methodology
4. Document reasoning at each step
5. Verify root cause with Forward/Backward tests

**Before Finalizing:**
- Validate conclusion against evidence
- Check for red flags (see common-root-causes.md)
- Confirm actionability (can you fix this?)
- Develop solutions addressing root cause

## Problem Definition Framework

Create a clear problem statement before analysis:

**Essential Elements:**
- **What:** Observable symptom (not assumed cause)
- **Where:** Location/system/component affected
- **When:** Timeline, frequency, pattern
- **Impact:** Users/systems affected, severity

**Example:**
"Users in EU region experience 3-5 second dashboard load delays during 9-11 AM UTC peak hours, affecting ~2,000 daily active users. Started after v2.4 deployment on Nov 18th."

## Evidence Gathering (Go and See)

Follow Toyota's principle—collect facts, not opinions:

**Key Evidence Sources:**
- Logs, metrics, monitoring data
- Timeline of events and changes
- System/code/configuration changes before problem
- Environmental factors (load, traffic, season)
- User reports and reproduction steps
- System state before/during/after

## RCA Methodologies

See `resources/rca-methodologies.md` for complete methodology guide.

## Resource Files Summary

### `resources/rca-methodologies.md`
Comprehensive methodology guide covering:
- **5 Whys**: Step-by-step process with software examples

- **Personal/Life**: Health, habits, environment, skills
- Red flags, recurring themes, pattern recognition

### `resources/example-analyses.md`
Four worked examples with full analysis:
1. **Software Bug**: JWT authentication (5 Whys)
2. **Vehicle Maintenance**: Overheating (5 Whys)
3. **System Failure**: E-commerce checkout (Fishbone + 5 Whys)
4. **Personal Productivity**: Missed deadlines (Fishbone + 5 Whys)

### `resources/advanced-techniques.md`
Formal methods for complex problems:
- **Fault Tree Analysis**: Boolean logic, safety systems
- **Barrier Analysis**: Control failures
- **Multi-Methodology Chains**: Complex orchestration
- **Verification Frameworks**: Comprehensive testing

## How This Skill Works

1. **Clarify your situation**: Domain, observations, evidence, time
2. **Recommend approach**: Complexity analysis, methodology, resources
3. **Guide through analysis**: Problem statement, evidence, methodology, verification
4. **Deliver output**: Analysis, root cause, solutions, implementation

## Quick Start: 5-Minute RCA

1. State problem (What/Where/When/Impact)
2. First Why: fact-based answer
3. Second Why: dig deeper
4. Third Why: dig deeper again
5. Verify: would fixing this prevent it?

## Templates & Examples

- **5 Whys Template** in `resources/rca-methodologies.md`
- **Fishbone Template** in `resources/rca-methodologies.md`
- **Worked Examples** in `resources/example-analyses.md`
- **Solution Structures** in `resources/example-analyses.md`

## Next Steps

1. Identify problem domain (software/hardware/process/personal)
2. Load appropriate resource from table above
3. Select methodology based on complexity
4. Follow step-by-step process in resource
5. Verify root cause (Forward/Backward tests)
6. Develop actionable solutions

**Remember**: Goal is systematic investigation—disciplined questioning until you reach a cause you can actually fix.
