# Blog Feature Skill for Blazor WASM + Azure Functions

This skill provides a complete, production-ready blog feature for Blazor WASM applications hosted on Azure Static Web Apps with serverless backend processing.

## Quick Reference: When to Load Which Resource

| Your Task | Load Resource | Key Concepts |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Understand architecture, prerequisites, shared models | `resources/core-architecture.md` | 3-layer architecture, project structure, data models |
| Implement backend services, Azure Functions, file share integration | `resources/backend-services.md` | BlogStorageService, YAML parsing, DI setup |
| Build Blazor components, UI pages, styling | `resources/frontend-components.md` | Razor components, markdown rendering, responsive design |
| Configure Azure environment, local settings, deployment | `resources/azure-configuration.md` | Connection strings, file share setup, environment variables |
| Create sample content, test workflow, troubleshoot issues | `resources/sample-content-testing.md` | Sample markdown, testing checklist, common issues |

## Orchestration Protocol

### Phase 1: Setup & Understanding

**Before writing any code, establish context:**

1. Review your current Blazor WASM project structure
2. Confirm you have Azure Functions API project ready
3. Verify Azure Storage account and File Share access
4. Load `resources/core-architecture.md` to understand 3-layer design

**Quick assessment:**
- Do you have existing Blazor WASM + Functions project? → YES, proceed
- Do you need to understand what to build? → Load core-architecture.md first
- Are you setting up Azure resources? → Go to azure-configuration.md

### Phase 2: Implementation Selection

**Choose your implementation path:**

| Your Situation | Load This First | Then Load |
|---|---|---|
| Starting from scratch | core-architecture.md | backend-services.md |
| Backend complete, need UI | frontend-components.md | (skip backend-services.md) |
| Just need configuration help | azure-configuration.md | (reference other resources as needed) |
| Debugging or testing | sample-content-testing.md | (target troubleshooting section) |

### Phase 3: Execution & Validation

**Implementation sequence:**

1. **Create project structure** (core-architecture.md Step 1-2)
2. **Add NuGet packages** (backend-services.md)
3. **Implement BlogStorageService** (backend-services.md)
4. **Create Azure Functions** (backend-services.md)
5. **Build Blazor components** (frontend-components.md)
6. **Configure Azure environment** (azure-configuration.md)
7. **Test locally** (sample-content-testing.md testing workflow)
8. **Deploy to Azure** (azure-configuration.md deployment section)

**Validation checkpoints:**
- Backend: Functions respond correctly to test calls
- Frontend: Components load and display posts
- Integration: End-to-end blog viewing works
- Azure: Configuration deployed and accessible

## Common Workflow Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fresh Implementation (First Time)
**Timeline: 2-3 hours**

1. Read `core-architecture.md` → understand what you're building
2. Follow `backend-services.md` → implement API layer
3. Follow `frontend-components.md` → build UI layer
4. Follow `azure-configuration.md` → configure Azure resources
5. Use `sample-content-testing.md` → validate with sample posts

### Scenario 2: Existing Backend, Need Frontend
**Timeline: 1 hour**

1. Skip to `frontend-components.md`
2. Reference `core-architecture.md` if component questions arise
3. Use sample posts from `sample-content-testing.md`
4. Deploy following `azure-configuration.md`

### Scenario 3: Update Existing Blog
**Timeline: 30 minutes**

1. Jump to relevant resource file
2. Reference back to `core-architecture.md` for context
3. Test changes with `sample-content-testing.md` checklist

### Scenario 4: Troubleshooting Issues
**Timeline: As needed**

1. Go directly to `sample-content-testing.md`
2. Find problem in troubleshooting section
3. Reference other resources for context if needed

## Architecture Summary

**Frontend → Backend → Storage:**
- Blazor WASM pages call HTTP endpoints
- Azure Functions retrieve from File Share
- Markdown files with YAML frontmatter contain all content
- No database needed (files are the database)

**Key Components:**
- **BlogStorageService**: Abstracts File Share interactions
- **BlogFunctions**: HTTP endpoints for listing/retrieving posts
- **Index/Post Razor Components**: Client UI for browsing
- **CSS Styling**: Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Implementation Complexity

| Component | Complexity | Time |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| Backend Services | Medium | 45 min |
| Azure Functions | Easy | 30 min |
| Frontend Components | Medium | 60 min |
| Styling | Easy | 30 min |
| Configuration | Easy | 20 min |
| **Total** | **Easy-Medium** | **~3 hours** |

## Prerequisites Checklist

- ✅ Existing Blazor WASM SWA project
- ✅ Azure Functions API project
- ✅ Azure Storage account with File Share
- ✅ .NET 10 SDK (or later)
- ✅ Azure CLI (for deployment)
- ✅ Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio

## Resource Files Summary

### `resources/core-architecture.md` (285 lines)
Foundational knowledge about the blog system architecture, project structure, and shared data models needed across frontend and backend.

**Load when:** Getting started, understanding the design, creating shared models

### `resources/backend-services.md` (425 lines)
Complete implementation of Azure File Share service integration, BlogStorageService class, and Azure Functions for blog operations.

**Load when:** Building the API layer, implementing backend services

### `resources/frontend-components.md` (610 lines)
Blazor Razor components for blog listing and detail pages, CSS styling for responsive design, navigation integration.

**Load when:** Building the UI layer, styling components, creating Razor pages

### `resources/azure-configuration.md` (445 lines)
Azure environment setup, local development configuration, File Share structure, deployment guidelines, and security considerations.

**Load when:** Setting up Azure resources, configuring environments, deploying to production

### `resources/sample-content-testing.md` (395 lines)
Sample markdown formats, complete testing workflow checklist, troubleshooting guide for common issues, and enhancement ideas.

**Load when:** Creating test data, validating implementation, debugging problems

## Best Practices

1. **Start with core-architecture.md** - Don't skip understanding the design
2. **Implement sequentially** - Backend first, then frontend, then configuration
3. **Test locally** - Use Azure Storage Emulator before deploying
4. **Use sample content** - Test with provided markdown examples
5. **Follow naming conventions** - Consistent file naming prevents errors

## Quick Navigation by Goal

| I want to... | Resource | Section |

| Understand the system | core-architecture.md | Architecture Overview |
| Create the backend | backend-services.md | BlogStorageService |
| Build the UI | frontend-components.md | Blog Listing Page |
| Set up Azure | azure-configuration.md | Azure File Share Setup |
| Test everything | sample-content-testing.md | Testing Workflow |
| Fix a problem | sample-content-testing.md | Troubleshooting Guide |
| Deploy to production | azure-configuration.md | Deployment Checklist |
