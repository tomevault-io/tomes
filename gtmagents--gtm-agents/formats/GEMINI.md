## Workspace Structure

The `workspace/` directory provides a consistent folder structure for all agent operations. **All agent outputs should be saved to the appropriate workspace folder.**

### Folder Structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `clients/` | Client-specific folders and projects |
| `campaigns/` | Marketing and sales campaign materials |
| `content/` | Blog posts, articles, and content assets |
| `strategies/` | Content strategies and marketing plans |
| `research/` | Market research and data analysis |
| `social-media/` | Social media content and calendars |
| `email-campaigns/` | Email marketing materials and sequences |
| `reports/` | Performance reports and analytics |
| `templates/` | Reusable templates for deliverables |
| `assets/` | Brand assets, images, and media |
| `leads/` | Lead lists, prospect data, and enrichment |
| `pipelines/` | Sales pipeline snapshots and forecasts |
| `analytics/` | Analytics dashboards and data exports |

### Agent Output Routing

When agents generate outputs, save to the appropriate folder:

| Agent Type | Output Folder |
|------------|---------------|
| Lead generation | `workspace/leads/` |
| Content creation | `workspace/content/` |
| Campaign planning | `workspace/campaigns/` |
| Research & analysis | `workspace/research/` |

| Competitive intel | `workspace/competitive-intel/` |
| Email sequences | `workspace/email-campaigns/` |
| Social content | `workspace/social-media/` |
| Strategy docs | `workspace/strategies/` |
| Persona development | `workspace/personas/` |

### Client Project Structure

Create subfolders for each client:
```
workspace/clients/
├── acme-corp/
│   ├── briefs/
│   ├── deliverables/
│   └── notes/
└── techstart-inc/
    ├── briefs/
    └── deliverables/
```

### Campaign Organization

Organize campaigns by quarter or initiative:
```
workspace/campaigns/
├── 2025-q1-product-launch/
├── 2025-q2-abm-enterprise/
└── ongoing-nurture/
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Lowercase with hyphens**: `q1-campaign-brief.md`
- **Include dates**: `2025-01-15-pipeline-report.csv`
- **Prefix drafts**: `draft-blog-post-ai-sales.md`
- **Prefix finals**: `final-case-study-acme.pdf`

- **Opus (28)**: Deep analysis for research and executive-level work

### 3. Skills (243 total)
Modular knowledge packages using progressive disclosure:
- Metadata loads first (~100 tokens)
- Full instructions load when needed (<5k tokens)
- Bundled files/scripts load only as required

### 4. Commands
Executable tools following pattern: `/[plugin-name]:[command-name] [parameters]`

---

## Key Commands by Function

### Sales
```bash
/sales-prospecting:generate-leads --criteria "B2B SaaS, 50-500 employees"
/sales-pipeline:analyze-pipeline --quarter Q1
/sales-enablement:create-battlecard --competitor "Competitor X"
/sales-calls:prepare-call --account "Acme Corp"
```

/product-launch-orchestration:assemble-war-room --launch "Q2 Product"
/lead-nurture-orchestration:design-nurture --segment "MQL"
```

---

## Development Guidelines

### Creating New Assets

Use scaffolding scripts:
```bash
python scripts/scaffold_asset.py agent plugins/[plugin]/agents/[name].md
python scripts/scaffold_asset.py command plugins/[plugin]/commands/[name].md
python scripts/scaffold_asset.py skill plugins/[plugin]/skills/[name]/SKILL.md
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: lowercase with hyphens (`lead-researcher.md`)
- **Plugins**: lowercase with hyphens (`sales-prospecting`)
- **Commands**: verb-noun format (`generate-leads`)

### Quality Standards
- All skills require `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`)
- Skills follow structure: When to Use / Framework / Templates / Tips
- Agents include role descriptions, frameworks, workflows, deliverables
- No placeholder content or TODOs in production files

### Validation
Run before committing:
```bash
python scripts/validate_marketplace.py
python scripts/smoke_test_plugins.py
```

Pre-commit hooks (Husky) run these automatically.

## Architecture Principles

### Business-First Design
- Designed for non-technical GTM users
- No coding required
- Natural language interaction supported

### Token Optimization
- Average 3.2 components per plugin (follows Anthropic's 2-8 pattern)
- Progressive disclosure for skills
- Model selection based on task complexity

### Orchestration Patterns
1. **Pipeline**: Sequential stages (brief → build → QA → launch)
2. **Diamond/Fan-out**: Parallel middle stages
3. **Iterative/Conditional**: Reviews, approvals, guardrail branches

### Model Selection Strategy
- **Haiku**: Data processing, routine tasks, fast execution
- **Sonnet**: Strategy, creative work, complex reasoning
- **Opus**: Deep research, executive-level analysis

## Agent Skills Compliance

This repository is migrating to the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard maintained by Anthropic. This enables interoperability with Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex, and other compatible agents.

### Compliance Status

| Component | Standard | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Skills (243) | Agent Skills spec | ✅ Compliant |
| Agents (203) | GTM-specific | Custom extension |
| Commands | GTM-specific | Custom extension |
| Plugins (67) | GTM-specific | Custom extension |

### Skill Structure (Agent Skills Compliant)

Each skill follows the Agent Skills specification:
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: YAML frontmatter + instructions
├── scripts/          # Optional: executable code
├── references/       # Optional: additional documentation
└── assets/           # Optional: templates, resources
```

### SKILL.md Format

```yaml
---
name: skill-name                    # Required (must match directory)
description: What it does...        # Required (max 1024 chars)
license: Apache-2.0                 # Optional
compatibility: Claude Code          # Optional
metadata:                           # Optional
