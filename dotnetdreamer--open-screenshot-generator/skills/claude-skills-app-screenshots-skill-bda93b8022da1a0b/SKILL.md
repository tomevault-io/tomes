# App Screenshots & Browser Verification

Drives the real app in headless Edge to verify changes end-to-end: screenshots, element adds, screenshot uploads, PNG exports, and pixel-level quality checks.

## Prerequisites

- Dev server on **http://localhost:9002** — usually already running (`npm run dev`; `EADDRINUSE` means reuse it, Next.js hot-reloads your edits).
- A Chromium browser. `lib.js` finds it per platform (Edge first, then Chrome/Chromium/Brave; `C:/Program Files...` on Windows, `/Applications/...` on macOS, `/usr/bin/...` on Linux) and every script imports `EDGE` from there. Set `APP_BROWSER` to override. Headless Edge via puppeteer uses the **real GPU** (verified: ANGLE D3D11), so WebGL renders match what the user sees. No swiftshader flags needed.
- ffmpeg/ffprobe at `C:/ffmpeg-2026-02-04-git-627da1111c-essentials_build/bin/`.
- One-time: `cd .claude/skills/app-screenshots/scripts && npm install` (installs puppeteer-core).

## Golden rules (each one cost real debugging time — do not skip)

1. **Never use `page.screenshot({ clip })`.** Clipped captures briefly resize the emulated viewport, which trips the responsive sidebar breakpoint and **remounts the palette, wiping tab/drill-in state**. Always take full-page screenshots and crop afterwards with ffmpeg.
2. **Radix tabs ignore synthetic `.click()`** — switch tabs with a real mouse click at the trigger's bounding-box center (`page.mouse.click`). Plain buttons/tiles are fine with DOM `.click()` via `page.evaluate` (also bypasses overlays).
3. **`waitForFunction` needs `polling: 500`** — the default rAF polling starves on static headless pages. Prefer string-expression predicates (`"document.querySelectorAll(...).length > 3"`) over function+args.
4. **After clicking "Start Blank", wait for `?projectId=` in the URL** before interacting — project creation settles asynchronously.
5. **File uploads:** start `page.waitForFileChooser()` *before* clicking the app's "Upload Screenshot" button, then `chooser.accept([path])`.
6. **Exports:** set `Browser.setDownloadBehavior` (CDP) to a download dir, click the export button, poll the dir until the expected number of `.png` files appears, then wait ~3s for writes to finish.

## App selectors

- Start screen: the blank-canvas card is a button whose text contains `Start blank` (lowercase b — it reads "Start blank" inside the "Start with a blank canvas" card). The template gallery is still the first thing on
  screen; an **AI agent banner** sits above the tabs. `lib.js` `openAgentScreen(page)` steps into that
  agent screen (back out via `button[aria-label="Back"]`), and `clickByTextContains` clicks a button by
  a text fragment.
- Tabs: `[role="tab"]` containing `Elements` / `Devices` / `Images` / `Previews`. **Previews** holds whole App
  Preview boards (see `src/lib/previewScenes.ts`); its tiles read `Add the <Scene Name> preview board
  (scene:<id>)` and each one adds an ARTBOARD, not an element, so count `[data-artboard-dom-id]` rather than
  `[data-element-id]` to detect the add. To review the scenes themselves, do NOT drive the canvas: headless
  Edge returns torn frames after scrolling the board row. Bundle `StaticArtboard` + `previewScenes.ts` with
  esbuild (same recipe as `regen-3d-thumbs.js`), serve the harness from `public/` so the posters resolve, and
  screenshot the mount node per scene. There is NO Layers tab anymore:
  Properties (top) and Layers (bottom) live in one right dock with a draggable divider
  (`[role="separator"]`) between them. Collapse the dock via `button[aria-label="Collapse right panel"]`;
  collapsed it becomes a slim vertical rail — expand via `button[aria-label="Expand right panel"]` or the
  rotated `Open Properties` / `Open Layers` buttons (by `title`). Dock state persists in localStorage
  (`abs-right-dock-open`, `abs-right-dock-layers-height`), so reset those keys if a test needs the default layout.
- Palette categories: `button[title="Browse <Category>"]` (e.g. `Browse 3D iPhone 17 Pro Max`, `Browse Colored iPhone`, `Browse Basic`); close with the `Back` button.
- Tiles: `button[aria-label="Add <label> (<libraryId>)"]` — they carry **no `title`** (a Radix hover card shows the label + library id instead), so match on the accessible name. `lib.js clickByTitle` handles both: pass `Add Transparent device` and it matches the `(devicecolor:iphone-transparent)` suffix for you. `button[aria-label^="Add "]` selects every tile in the open group.
- Elements tab search: `input[aria-label="Search elements by name or id"]` filters the whole Elements tab (Basic, App Preview and the vector library) by name, library id, group or keyword; `button[aria-label="Clear search"]` restores the category overview. Results replace the category grid, so type into it *instead of* opening a category.
- Toolbar by `title` attr: `New Artboard` (new artboard becomes active), `Zoom In`, `Zoom Out`.
- **Import and Export are dropdown menus**, `button[title="Open a project"]` and `button[title="Export"]`. Their items are `[role="menuitem"]`: `From a project file` / `From your account`, and `Project file` plus the render item, whose label depends on the project: `Artboards as images` for screenshot projects, `App preview video` for App Preview ones (match on either, or on the `.mp4` suffix). Radix opens them on pointerdown, so a DOM `.click()` does nothing: use `lib.js clickMenuItem(page, 'Export', 'Artboards as images')`, which mouse-clicks the trigger and then the item in the portal.
- Canvas elements: `[data-element-id]` (count them to detect adds).
- **Export dialog:** the Export menu's `Artboards as images` opens the "Export Screenshots" dialog (it no longer downloads directly). Checkboxes by id: `#export-as-is` (checked by default), `#gen-ios`, `#gen-ipad-pro-13`, `#gen-ipad-11` (App Store sizes to generate; disabled when the current canvas already covers that format). Confirm with the dialog button whose text is `Export`. `lib.js exportArtboards` handles all of this and takes an optional `extraFormats` array of those ids.
- **App Preview video projects get a DIFFERENT dialog** ("Export App Preview Video", radio ids `#apv-styled` / `#apv-raw`, buttons `Export Styled Video` / `Export Store-Ready Recording`, plus `Export PNG stills instead` for the still path). Any project holding a recording mockup (`video-device`), a video/gesture element or an animation routes here — there are no App Store screenshot-size options. `lib.js exportArtboards` detects which dialog opened and takes the PNG path in both, so preview generation still works for the `pv-*` templates.
- Exported files are named `<NN>_<Artboard_Name>[_<Device_Format>].png` with spaces → underscores; `NN` is the zero-padded canvas order and the device-format suffix (iPhone/Android/iPad_13-inch/iPad_11-inch/7-inch_tablet/10-inch_tablet) appears when the artboard's mockups resolve to one format (e.g. `01_Blank_Artboard.png`, `01_Blank_Artboard_iPhone.png`). Generated App Store formats download extra files per artboard (e.g. `01_Blank_Artboard_iPad_13-inch.png` at exactly 2064×2752).

## Scripts (in `scripts/`)

- `lib.js` — reusable helpers implementing all rules above: `launch`, `startBlankProject`, `clickTab`, `clickByText`, `clickByTitle`, `addTileAndCount`, `uploadScreenshotToSelected`, `exportArtboards`, `shot` (full-page only).
- `example-flow.js` — complete worked example: blank project → Devices tab → open a 3D category → add a tile → upload a screenshot → export → download. Run: `node example-flow.js`.
- `verify-detach.js` — end-to-end check of the **detachable right dock** on the web path: detach opens a popup, the popup renders the editor's panels from a pushed snapshot, and selecting a layer, typing into the properties form, deleting a layer and jumping a history state all land back in the editor. Needs the dev server. `node .claude/skills/app-screenshots/scripts/verify-detach.js`
- `verify-detach-desktop.js` — the same feature on the **desktop** path, which is the one that matters for a second monitor. Needs the app running with WebView2's inspector open: `WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS=--remote-debugging-port=9333 npm run tauri:dev`, then `node .claude/skills/app-screenshots/scripts/verify-detach-desktop.js`. Drives the Tauri webview over CDP and checks a real panel window opens, the Tauri event bus reaches it, it is placed inside a display work area, it remembers its geometry, reopening does not resize it, and reattaching closes it. **Never run `npm run build` while a dev server is up**: the production build writes into the same `.next` and the dev server serves 500s until it is cleared.
- `regen-3d-thumbs.js` — regenerates the 156 thumbnails (iPhone / Android / Apple Watch / MacBook / iMac × pose × side × finish; each device renders exactly the poses in its sizes map — 'front' is watch+mac only, and the Macs render a curated subset with a landscape wallpaper) in `public/elements/device-3d/` by bundling the real `Device3DRenderer` with esbuild and screenshotting each pose/side/finish with a transparent background. Optional args filter by device key (`... regen-3d-thumbs.js macbook imac`). Run it whenever poses, finishes, or materials change in `Device3DRenderer.tsx`. Run from the repo root: `node .claude/skills/app-screenshots/scripts/regen-3d-thumbs.js`.
- `gen-app-skeletons.js` — regenerates the neutral **skeleton-screen library** in `public/data/projects/app-screens/` used to fill empty phone mockups in the App Screenshots templates (the full-height counterpart to `fg-screens/`, in the inboxly-screen-inbox.png visual language: soft grey blocks, one soft accent). Outputs 6 archetypes × {light,dark,eco} — `app-<list|feed|grid|player|dashboard|chat>-<light|dark|eco>.png` — at 846×1710 @ DPR2 (== the iphone-15 screen aspect, so `objectFit:cover` never crops). `light`/`dark` use an indigo accent; `eco` is the light greys with a soft green accent (for green/nature templates like verda-eco). Themes live in the `THEMES` map — add one there and it renders automatically. Edit the archetype builders / palettes, then rerun from repo root: `node .claude/skills/app-screenshots/scripts/gen-app-skeletons.js` (all) · `... eco` (one theme) · `... grid player` (archetypes) · `... grid-eco` (one key).
- `wire-app-skeletons.js` — assigns those skeletons to the App Screenshots templates. Holds the per-app `{theme, cycle}` MAP and surgically inserts `screenshotSrc` + natural dims after each device's `deviceType` line (every device already carries `screenshotObjectFit:"cover"` + a full `screenshotRect`), cycling archetypes so adjacent phones differ. Formatting-preserving and idempotent (skips templates already wired or holding real screenshots). `node wire-app-skeletons.js` (all mapped) · `... <slug ...>` (subset) · `... --report` (dry run). Feature-graphic (`fg-*`), connectly-chat, listly-tasks, inboxly-mail and darzi-studio are intentionally not in the MAP.
- `gen-mac-skeletons.js` — regenerates the **macOS skeleton-screen library** in `public/data/projects/mac-screens/` used to fill the MacBook/iMac mockups in the Mac templates (desktop counterpart to `gen-app-skeletons.js`). 6 archetypes (mail, dashboard, kanban, editor, music, chat) × 5 themes (light, dark, amber, lime, blue) at 1280×800 @ DPR2 = 2560×1600 — the exact 16:10 Mac screen aspect. Same CLI filtering as the watch script: `node gen-mac-skeletons.js lime` / `... kanban` / `... mail-amber`.
- `gen-previews.js` — generates the **card-thumbnail previews** for the App Screenshots gallery (the counterpart to the `fg-*` previews the feature-graphic tab already had). Per template: Pass A opens it and exports its artboards (clean, chrome-free), Pass B composes a wide **3:1 phone-carousel strip** on the template's own background and rewrites `previewImage` to `/data/projects/previews/<slug>.png`. Matches the App Screenshots category (`previewAspect '3 / 1'`, `previewFit 'contain'`; the gallery treats any non-`placehold.co` previewImage as a real strip and renders it `object-contain`). Needs the dev server up. `node gen-previews.js` (all 41) · `... <slug ...>` (subset) · `... --compose-only` (reuse cached exports in `%TEMP%/artboard-previews-src/`). Caps the strip at 6 screens.
- `compose-preview.js` — the strip compositor used by `gen-previews.js`: lays exported artboard PNGs as rounded, shadowed cards centered on a background at 1500×500 @ DPR2. `renderOnPage(page, dir, bgCss, out, max)` reuses one browser; CLI `node compose-preview.js <artboardDir> <bgCss> <outFile> [maxScreens]` for one-offs.

**After any script that changes template JSONs or `previewImage` values** (wire-app-skeletons, gen-previews, or hand edits), regenerate the AI agent's hosted catalog: `npm run gen:ai-catalog` (also runs inside `npm run build`). It rewrites `public/data/ai/catalog.txt`, whose verification token is a content hash — a stale file makes the agent's URL mode silently fall back to inline prompts once deployed. Details: docs/AI-AGENT.md.

## Verifying image quality

- Crop 1:1 regions with ffmpeg and view them: `ffmpeg -i export.png -vf "crop=W:H:X:Y" out.png`.
- Zoom for pixel inspection: add `,scale=iw*3:ih*3:flags=neighbor`.
- Measure (e.g. prove a shadow/halo is gone — background must be pure 255):
  `ffmpeg -i export.png -vf "crop=10:10:X:Y,format=gray,signalstats,metadata=print:file=-" -frames:v 1 -f null -` then read `YMIN`/`YAVG`.
- Test screen for pixelation checks (gradient + 2px grid shows blur/aliasing immediately):
  `ffmpeg -f lavfi -i "gradients=s=1080x2400:c0=0x4F46E5:c1=0x06B6D4:x0=0:y0=0:x1=1080:y1=2400" -vf "drawgrid=w=120:h=120:t=2:color=white@0.55" -frames:v 1 screen-test.png`

## Workflow

1. Make code changes; the running dev server hot-reloads them.
2. Write a small driver on top of `lib.js` (or extend `example-flow.js`) for the flow under test.
3. Screenshot full pages, crop with ffmpeg, Read the crops to visually confirm.
4. For exports, always open the downloaded PNGs and check 1:1 crops — don't trust the on-screen look alone (exports take a different rendering path).
5. Put temp output in the session scratchpad; stage anything the user should review in `C:/Users/ik/Downloads/artboard-3d-verification/`.
