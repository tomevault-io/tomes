## Rules

**Mutating**

1. `handleArtboardsUpdate(next)` is the only door. It repositions boards, writes Dexie, pushes undo. A raw `setArtboards` skips persistence and history. It writes **only** `{ id, name, timestamp, projectData }`, so a new top-level field on `Project` survives until the next keystroke and then vanishes: that is why `ProjectLocalization` is mirrored onto every artboard, and why the cloud-save link lives in its own Dexie table ([src/lib/cloud/links.ts](../src/lib/cloud/links.ts)).
2. Elements render in **two** places: [Artboard.tsx](../src/components/open-screenshot-generator/Artboard.tsx) and `StaticArtboard` in [PreviewDialog.tsx](../src/components/open-screenshot-generator/PreviewDialog.tsx). Miss one and the element vanishes there.
3. Text renders at `fontSize / 0.3` px and ignores `element.scale`. Resize text via `fontSize`. The box clips, so every place a **user** edits text content, family, size, weight or line height folds `fitTextBox` ([textFit.ts](../src/lib/textFit.ts)) into the same update. Template data is never re-fitted.
4. `ArtboardState.position` is derived and overwritten every update. Authoring it does nothing. So is `backgroundImageSlice`. Both are re-derived by `calculateArtboardPositions`, which also puts a board that has no background picture onto the shared one when `backgroundImageApply` is `all` or `span`. That is what makes a shared background stick: an artboard added later, a dropped preview scene and an agent-made board all join it, and a split re-slices itself after any add, delete, duplicate, reorder or resize, without one of those writers knowing the feature exists.
4a. A board's background **picture** (`backgroundImage`) renders as an `<img>` layer, never as a CSS `background-image`. `exportRaster.ts` explains why: WebKit paints the capture's SVG without waiting for a CSS background to decode, so the PNG would come out without it and nothing would report the loss. Its geometry lives in `artboardBackgroundImageBox`, shared by the canvas, the previews and the video compositor. Give it `max-width: none`, or Tailwind preflight clamps a slice back to one board.
4c. A colour **tint** is applied two different ways on purpose, and the split is about SIZE. An image **layer** gets an SVG filter on its `<img>` (`imageTint` in [elementStyle.ts](../src/lib/elementStyle.ts) + `ImageTintFilter`): one `feColorMatrix` that mixes each channel toward the tint and leaves alpha alone, so `objectFit` and cut-out PNGs are right for free. A **board background** gets a plain scrim div instead. Filtering something board-sized is what WebKit cannot do: measured at dpr 2 while dragging the strength on one 3870x2796 background, per step, **1824ms filtering the picture against 33ms for a div** (the desktop app is a WKWebView, so that is a frozen editor). Two rules follow. The filter id must be derived from the OWNER, never from the tint's values: a value-derived id mints a new `<filter>` and rewrites the `filter:` property every step, which is the 1824ms case; keeping it stable is 363ms. And the filter def must live INSIDE the node being captured, or it is missing from every export. The video compositor mirrors both: `source-atop` for a layer sprite, a board-wide `fillRect` for the background.
4b. A value the properties form reads out of a board and writes back has to survive `slimArtboard`, which swaps anything oversized for `ELIDED_SRC`. `useDockHost` drops that stand-in on the way home, because a detached panel writing it back would replace the real picture on every board with a string that resolves to nothing.

**Verifying**

5. `npm run typecheck` is the gate. `npm run build` ignores type and lint errors, so a green build proves nothing.
6. Typecheck already fails on 3 files under `promo/` (8 `csstype` duplicate-package errors). Nothing under `src/` fails. Diff against that, do not chase them.
7. **Never run `npm run lint`.** No ESLint config exists, so it hangs on an interactive prompt.
8. Playwright drives the real app: [tests/e2e/](../tests/e2e/), run with `npm run test:e2e` (or `test:e2e:web` / `test:e2e:desktop`). `web` is Chromium, `desktop` is WebKit with the Tauri IPC injected, and they run the SAME specs, so a change lands in both. Locators come from the page object in [tests/e2e/helpers/editor.ts](../tests/e2e/helpers/editor.ts); canvas geometry and pointer gestures from [helpers/canvas.ts](../tests/e2e/helpers/canvas.ts). Two things to know before reading a red run: the suite boots a whole editor per worker, so more than about 2 workers against a cold dev server times out in ways that look like failures, and `responsive.spec.ts` carries a deliberate `test.fail()` that the list reporter marks with a cross. For anything the suite does not cover, drive the app headlessly via the `app-screenshots` skill.

**Codegen you must re-run**

9. Changed a template or [templateCategories.ts](../src/lib/templateCategories.ts)? Run `npm run gen:ai-catalog`. Stale catalog silently downgrades the AI agent.
10. Changed `webAdapters.ts` / `webDriverCore.ts` / `webAssistantAgent.ts`? Run `npm run build:assistant-agent`, then rebuild Rust and relaunch. The bundle is `include_str!`'d into the exe, so a running `tauri dev` never picks it up.

**Paths and platform**

11. Wrap every `public/` asset src in `withBasePath()` from [basePath.ts](../src/lib/basePath.ts) **at render time**. Store paths canonical. `next/image` and `<img>` ignore `basePath` on a string src.
12. All file saves go through [src/lib/desktop.ts](../src/lib/desktop.ts). macOS WKWebView ignores `<a download>`, and WebViews ignore `target="_blank"` (use `openExternal()`).
13. Tauri allows nothing by default. A new command needs a line in `generate_handler![...]`; a new outbound host needs one in [capabilities/default.json](../src-tauri/capabilities/default.json). Missing entries look like network errors but are permission errors. `core:window:default` is **read only**: it answers `availableMonitors` and `outerPosition` but not one setter, and `onCloseRequested` needs `core:window:allow-destroy`, because Tauri prevents the native close whenever a window has a JS close-requested listener and the API's own handler calls `destroy()` to finish it. A new window label needs its own capability file, matched by a glob such as `panel-*`.
14. `isTauri()` is false during SSR and first client render. Gate desktop-only UI on a `mounted` flag too.

**UI**

15. Never a bare `flex` on Radix `TabsContent` (it defeats `[hidden]`). Never a Radix `ScrollArea` under `flex-1` or `max-h` (it stops scrolling). Use `data-[state=active]:flex` and a native `overflow-y-auto` div.
16. Inactive tab panels stay **mounted**. Scope any `querySelector` to `[role="tabpanel"][data-state="active"]`.
17. shadcn/Radix + Tailwind, `lucide-react` icons, semantic tokens from [globals.css](../src/app/globals.css), not raw colors.
18. Dark mode is **live**, and it stops at the artboard edge. The preference is system/light/dark ([theme.ts](../src/lib/theme.ts), [ThemeContext.tsx](../src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx), picked in [SettingsDialog.tsx](../src/components/open-screenshot-generator/SettingsDialog.tsx)); a blocking script in [layout.tsx](../src/app/layout.tsx) puts the class on `<html>` before first paint. `globals.css` re-declares the **light** palette on `.artboard` and `[data-artboard-surface]`, so nothing inside a board ever sees a dark token and an export is byte-identical in either theme. A new artboard render site needs one of those two markers or it will go dark. A raw colour that only reads on one ground needs a `dark:` variant.
19. **No em dashes and no en dashes** in anything a user reads. Use a comma, a period, a colon, or "to". No trailing period on short UI copy. Load the `ui-text` skill before writing any, see [Writing comments and user-facing copy](#writing-comments-and-user-facing-copy).

**Input**

20. Canvas interactions are **pointer** events, never mouse events: phones and iPads are supported and a finger fires no `mousedown`. That includes the guards, `onPointerDown={e => e.stopPropagation()}` on a control inside an element, never `onMouseDown`. Anything that must survive a drag needs `touch-action: none` on the thing being dragged, or the browser cancels the gesture to scroll.
21. A finger never hovers and never right-clicks. Hover-only affordances get `data-touch-reveal` (shown outright on a coarse pointer, see globals.css); the context menu also opens on a long press ([OpenScreenshotGeneratorLayout.tsx](../src/components/open-screenshot-generator/OpenScreenshotGeneratorLayout.tsx)); double-click is replayed from a double-tap by [DraggableElement.tsx](../src/components/open-screenshot-generator/elements/DraggableElement.tsx).
22. HTML5 drag and drop (`draggable`, `dataTransfer`) does not fire for touch at all. Palette tiles carry both: the native drag for a mouse, and a long-press drag ([use-touch-drag.tsx](../src/hooks/use-touch-drag.tsx)) for a finger. A new draggable source needs both.
23. The canvas scroll extents are stated in pixels in [CanvasArea.tsx](../src/components/open-screenshot-generator/CanvasArea.tsx), because the board layer is sized by a CSS transform and a transform contributes nothing to a scroll extent. Change how boards are laid out and `contentExtent` has to follow, or the canvas silently stops scrolling to the last board.
24. **A wheel is not a trackpad.** The canvas zooms on a mouse wheel and lets two fingers scroll, told apart by `isMouseWheel` in [CanvasArea.tsx](../src/components/open-screenshot-generator/CanvasArea.tsx) (`deltaMode`, then the legacy `wheelDeltaY` ratio). Ctrl or Cmd with a wheel always zooms, and the listener is registered by hand with `passive: false`, because React attaches wheel listeners passively and a passive listener cannot stop the browser zooming the page.
25. A user-facing switch that more than one place reads goes in [editorPreferences.ts](../src/lib/editorPreferences.ts): one cache, one listener set, live across the app. localStorage alone would leave an already mounted canvas on the old value until reload.

**Writing to storage the user owns**

25a. Two auto savers, and they are not symmetrical. Ours ([cloud/autoSave.ts](../src/lib/cloud/autoSave.ts)) defaults **on** and will create a cloud copy that does not exist yet. The one that writes to a person's own Drive or gists ([account/autoSync.ts](../src/lib/account/autoSync.ts)) defaults **off** and only ever **updates**: a row in the `accountLinks` table is its permission slip, minted only by a manual save or by opening that project from the account, so it can never create folders in somebody's Drive. It also never sweeps orphaned remote blobs, never resolves a conflict (neither provider has a conditional write, so it stops and asks), never clears the session on an expired token, and is held entirely while a live collab session is running. Adding a third destination copies those rules, not the cloud saver's.

**Live editing**

26. A remote change NEVER goes through `handleArtboardsUpdate` (it would republish and fill the author's undo stack with other people's edits); every local write into the CRDT is one transaction tagged `LOCAL_ORIGIN` (or it bounces back forever); nothing large may enter the document (a WebRTC message over ~256KB fails, so media travels as a reference and is fetched from the cloud copy). Full rules in [reference.md](reference.md).
27. The room key lives in the invite's URL **fragment** and is read at module load in [collab/links.ts](../src/lib/collab/links.ts), because Next's router `replaceState`s the fragment away during hydration. Never move that read into a component, and never put the key in a query string or a log.

**Versions**

28. The undo stack is never persisted (a hundred project snapshots on disk is issue #19 again). Crossing a reload is what [versions/store.ts](../src/lib/versions/store.ts) is for, and it is coarse on purpose: five triggers, a thinning curve, and a document that carries media by reference. A restore goes through `handleArtboardsUpdate` like any other edit, after keeping the state it replaces.

**More than one window**

29. The right dock can leave the editor and live on another display, so **the editor window is the only writer**. A detached panel renders a snapshot it was sent and answers clicks with a named intent; the editor replays that intent against the same handler the docked panel calls. A panel window must never write the project, join a live session, run auto save or start the MCP bridge. It renders [RightDockPanels](../src/components/open-screenshot-generator/panels/RightDockPanels.tsx), the same component the dock does, so the two cannot drift.
30. What crosses a window boundary goes through the projection in [protocol.ts](../src/lib/panels/protocol.ts), and that projection is the maintenance cost of the feature: a new PropertiesPanel field it drops will work docked and fail **silently** detached. Media never crosses (elements carry `asset:<id>` and `mediaId`, and IndexedDB is shared by every window on the origin); a `blob:` URL means nothing outside the document that made it.
31. Display geometry is in **physical** pixels, always. A 4K display at 150% next to a 1080p at 100% has no shared logical origin, so a position computed in logical units on one lands somewhere else on the other.

**Screenshot intake**

32. An uploaded screenshot is stored **once** and travels as `asset:<id>` ([intakeAssets.ts](../src/lib/intake/intakeAssets.ts)). The results deck renders the same shots inside a dozen templates at once, and `getMediaUrl` caches one object URL per id, so every card shares one decoded image. Pass a `data:` URL around instead and each card decodes its own copy of a 2796px PNG.
33. Ranking and filling are **pure and offline**: [templateIndex.ts](../src/lib/intake/templateIndex.ts) derives its index from `projectData` (never a hand-authored tag file, which `gen:ai-catalog` would then have to track), and [autoFill.ts](../src/lib/intake/autoFill.ts) is a pure transform over a deep copy, so a preview can be rebuilt on every keystroke. `fillTemplate` keeps the template's own `id` because `handleSelectTemplate` reports it to analytics.
34. Duplicate screenshots are matched on the analysis **fingerprint** plus dimensions plus byte length, never on byte length alone: two different screens of one app routinely compress to the same size, and the user's set silently arrives short.
35. Every device frame in the catalog ships with placeholder art, so "is this frame empty" is never `!screenshotSrc`. A shipped placeholder is a public path; the user's own content is `asset:`, `data:` or `blob:`.
36. A card that would overspend the WebGL budget renders **flattened** (`flattenBoard3d`), never as the shipped preview PNG: the whole point of the deck is that the boards hold the user's screenshots.

## Writing comments and user-facing copy

Two skills are mandatory here, not optional polish.

**Any string a user reads**: a toast, dialog, button, tooltip (`title`), `aria-label`, placeholder, settings hint, empty state, start screen or tour card, store listing copy, or an error message that can reach a toast. Load the **`ui-text`** skill ([.claude/skills/ui-text/SKILL.md](../.claude/skills/ui-text/SKILL.md)) **before** writing it. It has the house patterns with real before/after strings, the vocabulary (artboard, project, element, export), and the traps. Then:

- `node .claude/skills/ui-text/copy.mjs locked "<old text>"` before rewording anything. Playwright specs and the `app-screenshots` scripts locate controls by their text, `title` and `aria-label`, so a LOCKED string changes together with its matcher in the same commit.
- `node .claude/skills/ui-text/copy.mjs check` on the diff before you finish.
- Do not sweep old strings. The early toasts in the layout break most of the patterns; fix one only when you are already in that code path.
- Editor copy is hardcoded in components. `src/lib/i18n/` translates the text **inside artboards**, never the editor UI.

**Any code comment or docstring** you write or edit: run it past the **`humanizer`** skill ([.claude/skills/humanizer/SKILL.md](../.claude/skills/humanizer/SKILL.md)). The patterns that come up most in this repo: §30 (writing about the previous version: a comment describes the code as it is, the history goes in the commit), §23 (filler), §1 (inflated claims), §28 (announcing the next point), and §14 (dashes). For UI copy the ones `ui-text` builds on are §4 (sales language), §7 (overused AI words), §13 (passive voice), §14 (dashes), §17 (title case), §19 (curly quotes), §23 (filler) and §24 (qualifiers).

## Commands

| Command | Note |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | port 9002, hard-coded in Tauri devUrl, the extension, and the harness |
| `npm run typecheck` | the real safety net |
| `npm run gen:ai-catalog` | after any template change |
| `npm run build:assistant-agent` | after any web-adapter change |
| `npm run tauri:dev` / `tauri:build` | desktop |
| `npm run build` | `gen:ai-catalog` then `next build` into `out/` |
| `npm start` | **not** a prod server, it just re-runs dev |
| `npm run lint` | broken, do not run |

Version lives in 4 files. Only `node scripts/set-version.mjs <patch|minor|major|X.Y.Z>` may change it.

## Adding things

Full recipes with every registration site are in [reference.md](reference.md). The steps people miss:

- **Element type**: type union, renderer, `Artboard.addElement` branch **and** its render branch, `PreviewDialog`, PropertiesPanel, LayersPanel, ElementPalette
- **Template**: the JSON, then its filename in `TEMPLATE_CATEGORIES[].files`. Nothing else discovers it
- **Preview scene** (a whole App Preview board, dropped from the palette's Previews tab): one entry in `PREVIEW_SCENE_LIST` in [previewScenes.ts](../src/lib/previewScenes.ts). That is the only registration site; the tab, the tile and the drop all read it
- **Device**: `DeviceType`, `DEVICE_REGISTRY`, `getFlatDeviceChrome`, `DEVICE_METRICS`, palette tile, MCP `DEVICE_TYPES`
- **Web AI provider**: `WEB_ADAPTERS`, `PROVIDERS` in `web_session.rs`, extension adapter + manifest + the `build:extension` entry list, `remote.urls` in `capabilities/assistant.json`
- **OpenAI-compatible preset** (a ready-made base URL in the "Use my API key" tab): one entry in `COMPATIBLE_PRESETS` in [providers.ts](../src/lib/ai/providers.ts). That is the only registration site. A preset is a convenience, never a gate: any endpoint works by typing its URL
- **MCP tool**: `McpDesignApi`, the `TOOLS` array, `mcpApi` in the layout, both `SLOW_TOOLS` lists if it is slow
- **Font**: `GOOGLE_FONTS`, plus `AGENT_FONTS` and a `<SelectGroup>` in [FontFamilySelect.tsx](../src/components/open-screenshot-generator/FontFamilySelect.tsx) if it is a new script. That one component is every picker. Fonts the **user** imports are separate: Dexie `fonts` table, see [customFonts.ts](../src/services/customFonts.ts)
- **Selection command** (anything acting on several layers at once, like align or group): the maths goes in [elementGeometry.ts](../src/lib/elementGeometry.ts) as a pure function over an element array, the handler in the layout, and the button in the multi-selection branch of [PropertiesPanel.tsx](../src/components/open-screenshot-generator/PropertiesPanel.tsx). Geometry commands commit through `commitView` (`position` and `size` are per-language keys); `groupId` and `groupName` are in `NEVER_DETACHABLE`, so grouping writes the base array through `handleArtboardsUpdate` instead, or it claims to have changed every language. Membership is a tag, not a container: [LayersPanel.tsx](../src/components/open-screenshot-generator/LayersPanel.tsx) draws the folder rows from `buildLayerRows`, and `groupCommandState` is what both panels ask whether Group and Ungroup have work to do. Dropping a row onto a group is one write through `dropLayer`, which moves the layer in the z-order and retags it together, so the line the list drew is the state that lands. The rows carry the drop target as `data-drop-*` attributes because the mouse (HTML5 drag) and the finger ([use-touch-drag.tsx](../src/hooks/use-touch-drag.tsx)) both resolve it from whatever is under the pointer. A command reachable from the panel also needs the `DockIntent` arm, see Panel prop below
- **Panel prop**: the field on `DockData` in [protocol.ts](../src/lib/panels/protocol.ts), the value in the layout's `dockData` memo, the prop in `RightDockPanels`, and, if it is a callback, an arm in the `DockIntent` union plus `dispatch` in [useDockHost](../src/lib/panels/useDockHost.ts) and `handlers` in [useDockClient](../src/lib/panels/useDockClient.ts)
- **Store slot** (App Store display type, Play image type): `APPLE_DISPLAY_TARGETS` / `PLAY_IMAGE_TARGETS` in [storeTargets.ts](../src/lib/publish/storeTargets.ts), the only registration site. A new outbound host also needs `capabilities/default.json`
