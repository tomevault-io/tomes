description: Create the required PR-ready summary block, branch suggestion, title, and draft description for openai-agents-js. Use in the final handoff after moderate-or-larger changes to runtime code, tests, examples, build/test configuration, or docs with behavior impact; skip only for trivial or conversation-only tasks, repo-meta/doc-only tasks without behavior impact, or when the user explicitly says not to include the PR draft block. Use when this capability is needed.

# PR Draft Summary

## Purpose

Produce the PR-ready summary required in this repository after substantive code work is complete: a concise change summary plus a PR-ready title and draft description for openai-agents-js.

## When to Trigger

- The task for this repo is finished (or ready for review) and it touched runtime code, tests, examples, docs with behavior impact, or build/test configuration.
- Treat this as the default final handoff step for substantive code work. Run it after any required verification or changeset work and before sending the "work complete" response.
- Skip only for trivial or conversation-only tasks, repo-meta/doc-only tasks without behavior impact, or when the user explicitly says not to include the PR draft block.

## Inputs to Collect Automatically (do not ask the user)

- Current branch: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`.
- Working tree: `git status -sb`.
- Untracked files: `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` (use with `git status -sb`; `--stat` omits them).
- Changed files: `git diff --name-only` (unstaged) and `git diff --name-only --cached` (staged); sizes via `git diff --stat` and `git diff --stat --cached`.
- Base reference (use the branch's upstream, fallback to `origin/main`):
  - `BASE_REF=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{upstream} 2>/dev/null || echo origin/main)`.
  - `BASE_COMMIT=$(git merge-base --fork-point "$BASE_REF" HEAD || git merge-base "$BASE_REF" HEAD || echo "$BASE_REF")`.
- Commits ahead of the base fork point: `git log --oneline --no-merges ${BASE_COMMIT}..HEAD`.
- Category signals for this repo: runtime (`packages/`, `examples/`, `helpers/`, `scripts/`), tests (`packages/**/test`, `integration-tests/`), docs (`docs/`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.github/`), build/test config (`package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `tsconfig*.json`, `tsc-multi.json`, `eslint.config.*`, `vitest*.ts`).

## Workflow

1. Run the commands above without asking the user; compute `BASE_REF`/`BASE_COMMIT` first so later commands reuse them.
2. If there are no staged/unstaged/untracked changes and no commits ahead of `${BASE_COMMIT}`, reply briefly that no code changes were detected and skip emitting the PR block.
3. Infer change type from the touched paths listed under "Category signals"; classify as feature, fix, refactor, or docs-with-impact, and flag backward-compatibility risk only when the diff changes released public APIs, external config, persisted data, or wire protocols. Judge that risk against the latest release tag, not unreleased branch-only churn.
4. Summarize changes in 1–3 short sentences using the key paths (top 5) and `git diff --stat` output; explicitly call out untracked files from `git status -sb`/`git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` because `--stat` does not include them. If the working tree is clean but there are commits ahead of `${BASE_COMMIT}`, summarize using those commit messages.
5. Choose the lead verb for the description: feature → `adds`, bug fix → `fixes`, refactor/perf → `improves` or `updates`, docs-only → `updates`.
6. Suggest a branch name. If already off `main`, keep it; otherwise propose `feat/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`, or `docs/<slug>` based on the primary area (for example `docs/pr-draft-summary-guidance`).
7. If the current branch matches `issue-<number>` (digits only), keep that branch suggestion. When an issue number is present, reference `https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-js/issues/<number>` and include an auto-closing line such as `This pull request resolves #<number>.` Do not block if the issue cannot be fetched.
8. Draft the PR title and description using the template below.
9. Output only the block in "Output Format". Keep any surrounding status note minimal and in English.

## Output Format

When closing out a task, add this concise Markdown block (English only) after any brief status note unless the task falls under the documented skip cases or the user says they do not want it.

```
# Pull Request Draft

## Branch name suggestion

git checkout -b <kebab-case suggestion, e.g., feat/pr-draft-summary-skill>

## Title

<single-line imperative title, which can be a commit message; if a common prefix like chore: or feat: etc., having them is preferred>

## Description

<include what you changed plus a draft pull request title and description for your local changes; start the description with prose such as "This pull request resolves/updates/adds ..." using a verb that matches the change (you can use bullets later), explain the change background (for bugs, clearly describe the bug, symptoms, or repro; for features, what is needed and why), any behavior changes or considerations to be aware of, and you do not need to mention any tests you ran.>
```

Keep it tight—no redundant prose around the block, and avoid repeating details between `Changes` and the description. Tests do not need to be listed unless specifically requested.
