# Harness — Phase 1 sequencer

Runs **once per project**. This skill owns only the **order** and the
checklist of what "harnessed" means; every step delegates to the skill that
does the work. A harness is the coupling between horse and load: after this
phase, a `/build` session can open, state its position, and act.

## The sequence

| # | Step | Delegate to |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Definition first.** No FSD → run Phase 0 now: `/define` (grill → create). FSD exists → verify every Must/Should carries a verification contract; missing ones are the first act | `/define` |
| 2 | Three planes installed or bound: FSD home, `docs/Method/`, `docs/UserDocumentation/` + `docs/00-Overview.md` at the docs root | `/define` planes mode |
| 3 | Testing standard stamped (setup/teardown/evidence rules + shared procedures, one file) | `/define` templates |
| 4 | `testing/test-plan.yaml` created; **capabilities declared** — bench capabilities copied from what the bench reports (`available: yes` as declared — a project never proves them), plus this project's own peers and equipment. Blocked is computed from these, never typed | this skill |
| 5 | Firmware integration — **only the modules the FSD requires.** UDP logging always (the loop's eyes inside the DUT); WiFi provisioning, OTA, BLE hooks only when the FSD carries the corresponding requirements. A module the spec never asked for is silent pack adoption | `testbench-integration` |
| 6 | CI: build on push, release on tag **plus the release-verify job** (flash the released artifact to the testbench, run the journey; red journey = no release) | `setup-action` |
| 7 | Devcontainer and toolchain, with the **GitHub Actions runner inside it** — see below | `esp-idf-handling` / `esp-pio-handling` (project + toolchain setup) |
| 8 | **Generate this project's gate checks** — one file per gate under `testing/gates/`, filled with this project's paths, ids, DUT, capabilities, markers and CI. A generic checklist cannot catch a project-specific omission | this skill · `../build/references/gate-checks.md` |
| 9 | **Close with the two questions only the user can answer** — see below | this skill |

## Step 5 — a skeleton, and the DUT is not touched

**The DUT is completely out of Phase 1.** Not flashed, not reset, not read.
No `chip/info`, no serial monitor, no esptool, no slot claimed. The board
belongs to `/commission`, which discovers it, verifies it is the unit the FSD
names, and proves the forward path to it. A harness session that has touched
the DUT has done Phase 2's work without Phase 2's gate watching.

**The firmware is a skeleton that proves the pipeline, nothing more.** It
compiles, it produces an artifact, and it emits one marker. It implements no
requirement and verifies no requirement — those are `/build`'s waves, run
against the journey. The gate asks only that CI went green once and that no
module exists which the FSD never asked for; both are satisfied by a
composition root and a printed marker.

The pull that breaks this is always the same shape: **the skeleton needs a
hardware fact to compile.** Flash size, partition offsets, a pin, a clock. The
answer is never to go and read it off the chip — that is Phase 2 arriving
early because Phase 0 left a hole. **Send it back to `/define`**: a constraint
the build depends on belongs in the FSD, and a spec that omits one will pull
hardware work forward into whichever phase first hits the wall.

Symptoms that Phase 1 has drifted:

- a capability whose `observed:` evidence could only have come from the board
- a host test that asserts product behaviour rather than that the tier runs
- a build fixed by measuring the hardware instead of by amending the spec

## Step 7 — the runner lives in the project's devcontainer

One project, one container — no separate infrastructure. The devcontainer
already holds the pytest bench tier, TestbenchDriver, discovery, and slot
config, which is everything the verify job needs (it downloads an artifact and
speaks HTTP; it never builds). **Installation is automated; registration is a
human grant** — a registered runner accepts and executes workflow code that
then physically drives the bench, a standing outward-facing authority like
the release tag itself. This skill installs the runner and the registration
script, states what registering means, and waits for the user's yes.
Register **per-repo**, labels `[self-hosted, testbench]`, ephemeral
registration in a restart loop, verify job triggered by tag push only,
approval required for outside contributors. Declare it as a capability:

```yaml
release-verification:
  what:      tag-triggered journey run against the released artifact
  available: yes   # the container runs 24/7; the bench may not — an absent
                   # bench at verify time is an unmet precondition (not done)
```

## Step 9 — the two unharvestable questions

Asked at the end, when the user knows the system's shape — and never
harvestable from any document:

1. **What has to be debugged before testing starts?** Which **project-side**
   parts — this board, its wiring, its peers and simulators — have never been
   observed doing their job here. Becomes the **debugging agenda** that
   `/commission` burns down. **The testbench is not on this list**: a project
   depends on its quality, never proves it (`../commission/SKILL.md`).
2. **What does one ordinary successful run look like, end to end?** Ordered
   steps, an observable at each. Becomes the **journey tests** — one test per
   step, seeded into the plan as the gate every hardware session runs behind,
   and the first tests of Wave 1 (*Build the running prototype* —
   `../build/references/test-design.md` §5).

These two answers are worth more than everything else typed this month; take
them slowly. Full rationale: `../build/references/test-design.md` §5.

## Exit — AI harnessed

### Deliverables

| Deliverable | Content |
|---|---|
| **Test plan** | `testing/test-plan.yaml` — capabilities (bench as declared, project equipment own-state), the journey tests seeded from question 2, `phase`/`wave` fields |
| **Debugging agenda** | the project-side parts from question 1, each with *unproven because* and *proven by* |
| **Testing standard** | one file: setup/teardown/evidence rules plus shared procedures |
| **Firmware hooks** | only the modules the FSD requires; UDP logging always |
| **CI** | build on push, release on tag, release-verify job present |
| **Devcontainer + runner** | toolchain builds; runner installed, registration awaiting the user's grant |
| **Gate checks** | `testing/gates/` — one generated file per gate, project-specific, run by a fresh checker at each gate |

### The check — a dry run of the next session

```bash
test -f testing/test-plan.yaml && test -f testing/debugging-agenda.md
ls .github/workflows/                       # build + release-verify present
gh run list -L 1                            # CI has actually run green once
```

Then the only check that matters: **open a `/build` session and see whether it
can state its position and name the next act without asking you anything.**
If it can — the plan is readable, the capabilities are declared, the agenda
exists — the AI is harnessed. If it stalls, the missing input is the finding,
and it belongs to whichever step above left it out.

**Run the check in a fresh checker, not in this session** — the session that
built the harness is the worst judge of whether it landed
(`../build/references/gate-checks.md`). Spawn it with `testing/gates/` and the
repo, nothing else — **never memory, transcripts, or a summary of what this
session did**: a checker told what was decided will confirm it was done.

**The gate loops, it does not wave through.** If the checker returns `SHUT`,
go back to the step above that owns each finding, fix it, and re-run the whole
check with a **new** checker. Commissioning does not start on a partial
harness.

**AI harnessed** — derived, never declared. The next session starts with
`/commission`.
