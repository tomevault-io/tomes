# Define — Phase 0 (FSD skill)

Creates and maintains the **WHAT**: what the system must do, stated so that
compliance can be demonstrated. Every approved Must/Should carries a
**verification contract** — the requirement and its proof are co-engineered,
because attempting the contract *is* the quality gate: a requirement whose
stimulus cannot be stated is not finished.

**Interface with the loop:** contracts flow down — `/build` consumes them,
never edits them. Spec-defect findings flow up — when a declaration or an
executable test proves a contract unsatisfiable, `/build` reports and this
skill amends. A change request's Definition delta lands here
(`/build` → `../build/references/change-request.md`).

## 0. Scope — what this skill does and does not do

**Three things it must never do**: claim a requirement is verified because
code or a test merely exists; turn a recommendation into an approved
requirement silently; invent a normative threshold, tolerance, security
assumption, or failure behaviour.

| Activity | This skill | `/build` (Method) | Dev skills | Testbench skills |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Define scope, requirements, states, interfaces | Yes | No | No | No |
| Write verification contracts | Yes | Consumes | No | No |
| Architecture decisions | Yes (records) | No | May propose | No |
| Design and declare tests, own the plan | No | Yes | No | No |
| Generate firmware and executable tests | No | Dispatches | Yes | Support |
| Execute tests, capture evidence | No | Sequences | Processes | Captures |
| Decide unresolved product questions | No | No | No | No |

**GitHub is the system of record.** The FSD, the plan, tests, and evidence are
version-controlled artefacts; chat history is not authoritative. If the
project has no repository, create it as the first act — `git init`, the §10
skeleton, an initial commit — and commit each artefact as it is finished. An
untracked Method plane is unshared and therefore undocumented.

## 1. Scale and reach

Depth scales to inferred complexity. The core is domain-neutral — embedded,
networking, SDR, IoT, cloud, mobile, hybrid — with optional packs (§14).

## 2. Invocation

**The path to a new FSD is three steps**: sketch the rough idea → `/grill-me`
(shipped in this repo) until the design tree is resolved → this skill writes
it up.
`/harness` sequences this as the journey's Phase 0 when a project starts from
nothing.

Grilling sits outside this skill because the person being interviewed is the
right judge of when it is done. Step 2 must end with the decisions **absorbed
into the planes** — a decision living only in a transcript is re-assumed next
session, and there is **no decisions file**: a settled decision leaves its
*effect* as present-state content in the plane it governs (a rejected
alternative that is load-bearing becomes a stated negative requirement; mere
preferences leave no residue and may be legitimately re-decided when the
environment changes).

Four modes. Pick by what already exists and what the user is asking for.

| Mode | Invoke | Use when |
|------|--------|----------|
| **create** | `/define` + description | No FSD yet. **Harvest first** (§4), then ask only what is still open — 1–3 questions per round — and generate. |
| **update** | `/define update <path>` + delta | An FSD exists. Apply the delta surgically — never regenerate the whole file, never renumber a stable ID. Change-request deltas land here. |
| **grill** | `/define --grill` + description | **Cold start only** — no prior conversation, a brief too thin to infer architecture from. One question at a time, depth-first, each with a recommended answer. |
| **planes** | `/define --planes [path]` | Write the Method and UserDocumentation planes, or retrofit an existing doc set into the three planes. Preview the move plan and get confirmation **before** moving anything. |

Test design, audit, and reconcile are `/build` modes — the loop's, not the
spec's.

One rule holds across every mode: **never renumber a stable ID.** Obsolete
items are `deprecated` or `superseded`, never deleted. A value this skill
proposed stays `status: proposed` until accepted
(`references/requirement-quality.md` §2).

Per-mode steps, the `update` search order, and grill discipline:
`references/authoring.md`.

## 3. Tools

Use **Edit** rather than **Write** in `update` mode so unaffected chapters
stay byte-identical, and **AskUserQuestion** for clarifications so each one
carries its recommended answer.

## 4. Clarifying questions

**Harvest before asking.** Look in order: decisions settled earlier in the
conversation (a `/grill-me` session), a prior FSD, then the repo itself —
config files, protocol usage, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`. Tag each harvested
decision `[user]` so it is never mistaken for something the skill assumed.
Re-asking an answered question earns a shorter answer the second time.

Then ask only when what is *still* missing affects architecture, protocol
choice, interface definition, safety or regulatory constraints, phase
decomposition, platform, or an external integration. Everything else is
inferred and marked `(assumed)`.

**Every question carries a recommended answer.**

(The two unharvestable questions — the debugging agenda and the standard run —
belong to the journey, not the spec: `/harness` asks them at the end of Phase
1, and `/build` consumes the answers.)

## 5. Complexity scaling

Low / Medium / High, judged from component count, protocol count, external
integrations, real-time constraints, and domain:
`references/complexity-scaling.md`.

## 6. Information extraction and inference

### 6.4 Functional Requirements

- **State each requirement in the chapter of the component it constrains** —
  no global FR section in the Parts scheme (§7).
- Two ID conventions (pick one per project; `references/canonical-fsd-structure.md`):
  `FR-x.y`/`NFR-x.y [Must/Should/May]`, or stable clause IDs.
- Priorities **Must** / **Should** / **May**; "shall" language.

#### 6.4.1 Atomic and falsifiable

**Atomic** — one obligation. Split anything joining two verbs, a behaviour and
a deadline, a success and a failure path, or a list of outputs.

**Falsifiable** — a competent stranger can build a rig that returns pass or
fail: precondition, stimulus, observable response, deadline, tolerance,
failure behaviour, tier. Reject weasel words outright — *appropriate,
graceful, user-friendly, as needed, reasonable, sufficient, robust, seamless,
acceptable, normal operation, best effort* — and vacuous quantifiers.

Full rules, the 13-check gate, worked examples, and the verification contract
schema: **`references/requirement-quality.md`**.

### 6.5 Non-Functional Requirements

Performance, reliability, accuracy, scalability, power, security — all
obeying §6.4.1. "95th percentile API response under 200 ms at 50 concurrent
clients", never "responsive".

#### 6.5.1 Security profile before security requirements

Establish the **threat model first**, then derive. Where the profile does not
justify a protection, record an accepted risk in §5 — an honest "we do not
claim confidentiality at rest" beats a requirement nobody implements.
**Obfuscation is never encryption.** Checklist: `references/system-models.md` §7.

#### 6.5.2 State the constraints the build reads

**If a build can fail on a number, the spec states the number.** Flash size,
partition offsets, pin assignments, clock frequency, voltage, memory ceiling,
image size limit — anything a toolchain will otherwise supply from a default.

These are **constraints** (§1), not descriptions: "the DUT has 4 MB of flash"
is a note, while "a unit with less than 4 MB cannot run this firmware" is
falsifiable and can be checked against hardware.

The failure mode is indirect, which is why it survives review. A missing
figure does not produce a missing requirement — it produces a **later phase
arriving early**. The build breaks on a tool default, whoever is holding it
goes to the hardware for the answer, and hardware discovery has now happened
in whatever phase first hit the wall, outside the gate that was meant to watch
it. The spec looked complete throughout.

Ask it directly while writing §2.2: *which numbers will the build read, and
does this document state them, or is a default about to choose?*

### 6.9 Verification contracts — the WHAT side of testing

On every approved Must/Should, beside the requirement in the FSD:
preconditions, stimulus, expected observations, timing, tolerance,
**prohibited outcomes**, tier, evidence, cleanup. The contract establishes
normative intent — schema in `references/requirement-quality.md` §4.

Everything downstream of the contract — the plan entry, test design, the four
kinds, the chain, status, gaps — is `/build`'s. There is **no separate
test-specification layer** between contract and plan entry.

#### 6.9.1 State model — mandatory for stateful systems

Modes that persist between events — provisioning, connecting, operational,
degraded, recovery — get a formal state model. The **transition table is
normative** (from · event · guard · to · action · limit); every (state ×
event) pair handled, explicitly ignored, or impossible-by-construction with a
stated reason. Every normative row is a requirement. Bugs live in the
transitions, and a requirement list that never names a state cannot express
what happens when WiFi drops *during* provisioning.
`references/system-models.md` §3.

### 6.10 Component layering

Every FSD gets a layered component architecture in §2.4 — **L0 foundation →
L1 interfaces → L2 application logic**, strict one-way dependency; the L0/L1
line is ownership. The FSD body mirrors the layers; §x.0 Test Architecture
maps layers to tiers and references the generated matrix. Layer profiles and
tier taxonomy: `../build/references/test-architecture.md`. Source-layout rules
are HOW and live in the Method plane, not here.

### 6.11 The three planes

| Plane | Question | Document |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **WHAT** | What must be true? | the FSD |
| **HOW** | How is it built and changed? | `docs/Method/` |
| **OPERATE** | How do I run it? | `docs/UserDocumentation/` |

Ask in order, first yes wins: externally observable ⇒ FSD; constrains how code
is written or verified ⇒ Method; tells a human how to run or recover it ⇒
UserDocumentation; about collaborating with the assistant ⇒ `CLAUDE.md` (not a
plane); why a past decision was made ⇒ commit message.

Two questions settle hard cases: *could a black-box tester verify it?* (yes ⇒
WHAT); *would it survive a rewrite in another language?* (no ⇒ HOW).

Planes are roles, not filenames — bind to a document that already fills the
role. The Method plane must be committed. Never invent a fourth plane.

Full model, retrofit procedure, templates: **`references/three-planes.md`**,
`references/templates/`.

## 7. Canonical FSD structure

Layer-grouped **Parts** scheme: front matter (§1 Overview, §2 Architecture
incl. §2.4, §3 Phases, §4 Risks), then Part A Application logic · Part B
Interfaces · Part C Foundation · Part D Cross-cutting · Part E Operations &
Verification, then appendices. Each component is a self-contained chapter;
numbering flat; depth ≤ `####`. No global FR or Interface section. Full
skeleton: `references/canonical-fsd-structure.md`.

## 8. Traceability

Computed by `/build`'s report from the plan — never a hand-maintained
Covered/GAP column in the FSD. The FSD carries requirement IDs and contracts;
the plan carries the tests that cite them and what they last produced.

## 10. Output layout

```text
docs/00-Overview.md       the plane map — at the docs root
docs/Functionality/       WHAT   — the FSD (or single FSD file, small projects)
docs/Method/              HOW    — 00-Overview · AI-Workflow · standards/ · project/
docs/UserDocumentation/   OPERATE — one user manual with chapters, from day one

testing/test-plan.yaml    every test, what it needs, what it produced (/build owns)
tests/{host,target,bench}/   executable tests (written by dev skills)
test-results/<run-id>/       evidence (captured by testbench skills)
```

**Create all three plane directories on the first commit, including the empty
one.** The user manual ships from the start with an honest status line
(`references/templates/user-documentation/`). **The OPERATE plane is one
manual with chapters, not a directory** — add a chapter, never a sibling.
There is no decisions file (§2). **Match the repo** — bind to existing
documents filling a plane's role rather than creating competitors.

## 11–12. Example output · evolve mode

Worked FSD excerpt: `references/example-output.md`. Preserve / update / add /
remove rules for deltas: `references/evolve-mode.md`.

## 12.5 Exit — Load defined

### Deliverables

| Deliverable | Content |
|---|---|
| **FSD** | requirements — atomic, falsifiable, provenance-tagged — each Must/Should carrying its verification contract; architecture (§2.4 layers); data model; interface definitions; state model where the system is stateful; configuration catalogue; security profile |
| **Method plane** | `docs/Method/` — build contract, standards, project bindings |
| **User manual** | `docs/UserDocumentation/` — from day one, with an honest status line |
| **Plane map** | `docs/00-Overview.md` |

The test plan is **not** here — it is Phase 1's (`/harness` step 4).

### The check — run it, report every failure

```bash
test -f docs/00-Overview.md && ls docs/Method/ docs/UserDocumentation/   # planes exist
grep -c "shall" <fsd>                                                    # requirements present
```

Then, per requirement, the gate that cannot be automated: **does it carry a
verification contract, and could a competent stranger build a rig from it that
returns pass or fail?** A requirement without a contract is unfinished; a
contract nobody could execute is a specification defect, not a test problem.

Then, per phase, the same question asked of §3: **can each phase be entered
using only what an earlier phase delivered?** Walk the phases in order and, for
each exit criterion, name the phase that supplies every capability it rests on.
A phase whose exit needs something a later phase builds is a sequencing defect
and returns to §3 — the requirements can all be perfect while the order in
which they are met is impossible. The failure is invisible per-requirement,
because each one is individually satisfiable; only the sequence is wrong. A
device configured solely through a portal cannot publish before the portal
exists, however well FR-PUB-01 is written.

Finally run the full quality checklist in `references/finalisation.md` §1 —
the 13 checks, weasel words, provenance, unbound `{{parameters}}` — and
**report each failure rather than shipping past it**.

**Run it in a fresh checker** using this project's `testing/gates/` file once
it exists (`../build/references/gate-checks.md`); on a project too young to
have one, run the checklist yourself and say so.

**The gate loops, it does not wave through.** Any check that fails sends the
work back to the step that owns it — a requirement without a contract returns
to requirement writing, a failed finalisation item to the section it belongs
to — and the whole check runs again afterwards. Phase 1 does not start on a
partial FSD.

**Load defined** — derived, never declared: every Must/Should has a contract,
every phase is enterable from the one before it, the three planes exist and are
committed, and no `(assumed)` marker remains on anything architecture-critical.

## 13. Finalisation

Before delivering, run the quality gate and fill the lifecycle metadata block:
**`references/finalisation.md`**. Report every failed check — a checklist run
silently and reported as passed is worth nothing.

## 13.1 Reference index

| File | Covers |
|------|--------|
| `references/finalisation.md` | Pre-delivery checklist, lifecycle metadata. Load at the end |
| `references/requirement-quality.md` | Statement types, provenance and status, the 13-check gate, the verification contract |
| `references/system-models.md` | Context, components, state model, interfaces, configuration and data catalogues, security profile |
| `references/three-planes.md` | WHAT / HOW / OPERATE model, routing, retrofit |
| `references/templates/` | `00-Overview` (docs root), the Method set, the user-manual stub |
| `references/canonical-fsd-structure.md` | Parts scheme and chapter skeleton |
| `references/complexity-scaling.md` | Depth scaling |
| `references/evolve-mode.md` | Delta rules |
| `references/example-output.md` | Worked FSD excerpt |
| `references/domains/` | Domain packs (ESP32) — requirement proposals |

## 14. Domain packs

Domains with recurring shapes get a pack under
`references/domains/<domain>.md`, loaded only when the project matches:
**detect** from description and code, **apply** its layer profile and tier
names, and **propose — never adopt**. Detecting `esp_mqtt` proves the project
speaks MQTT, not that it owes anyone offline buffering. Present matches via
`AskUserQuestion` with a recommendation, write only what is accepted, record
declines under *Explicitly out of scope*, tag provenance
(`[user]`/`[derived]`/`[code]`/`[pack:<domain>]`), bind every `{{parameter}}`.
**Run the pack backwards too** — what it detected that the decisions never
mention is either out of scope or a capability nobody thought of.

| Pack | Domain |
|------|--------|
| `esp32` | ESP-IDF / Arduino-ESP32: WiFi, BLE, MQTT, OTA, NVS, captive portal, watchdog, logging — test-case libraries live with `/build` (`../build/references/domains/esp32/`) |
