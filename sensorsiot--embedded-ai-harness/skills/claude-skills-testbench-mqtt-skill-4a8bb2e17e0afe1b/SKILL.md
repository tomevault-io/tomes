description: Use this skill whenever tests involve MQTT communication — starting/stopping the mosquitto broker on the testbench Pi, publishing test messages, subscribing to topics, or verifying ESP32 MQTT client behavior. The broker runs on the Pi's WiFi AP network (192.168.4.1:1883) so DUTs can reach it without internet. Use for MQTT integration tests, pub/sub verification, and broker lifecycle management. Triggers on "MQTT", "broker", "mosquitto", "publish", "subscribe", "topic", "MQTT test".

# ESP32 MQTT Broker

Base URL: `$TESTBENCH_URL` — see Step 0

## Step 0: Point at a bench

There are several benches and their addresses move, so nothing here writes one
down. `$BENCH` is not usable either — a container cannot resolve mDNS.
Discover the bench and export its URL:

```bash
export TESTBENCH_URL=$(sudo python3 .claude/skills/esp-idf-handling/discover-testbench.py \
                         --url --name <bench-hostname>)
curl -s "$TESTBENCH_URL/api/info"        # confirm before anything else
```

`--url` refuses to guess when more than one bench answers, so `--name` is
required whenever a second bench is powered on. `TESTBENCH_URL` is the same
variable `pytest --wt-url` falls back to.

The testbench can run an MQTT broker (mosquitto) for testing ESP32 devices that use MQTT for communication. The broker is accessible to devices connected to the testbench's WiFi AP.

## Endpoints

Request and response shapes: [FSD Appendix D.12](../../../docs/Harness-FSD.md#d12-mqtt-test-broker).

## Examples

```bash
# Start the MQTT broker
curl -X POST $TESTBENCH_URL/api/mqtt/start

# Check broker status
curl $TESTBENCH_URL/api/mqtt/status

# Stop the MQTT broker
curl -X POST $TESTBENCH_URL/api/mqtt/stop
```

## MQTT Broker Details

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Broker | the bench address (from the LAN) or `192.168.4.1` (from the testbench AP) |
| Default port | `1883` |
| Authentication | None (open broker for testing) |

## Common Workflows

1. **Test ESP32 MQTT client:**
   - Ensure device is on testbench WiFi (see testbench-wifi)
   - `POST /api/mqtt/start` — start broker
   - Device connects to `192.168.4.1:1883`
   - Monitor device behavior via serial or UDP logs (see testbench-logging)
   - `POST /api/mqtt/stop` — stop broker when done

2. **Test MQTT disconnect/reconnect:**
   - Start broker, let device connect
   - `POST /api/mqtt/stop` — device loses MQTT
   - Monitor device's reconnection behavior
   - `POST /api/mqtt/start` — device should reconnect

   **On a *shared* broker, don't stop it — isolate the one device.** If the
   broker also carries other devices (or the device under test uses a
   production broker over a tunnel rather than the bench mosquitto), stopping it
   is collateral damage. Cut MQTT for a single device with a source-scoped
   firewall rule on the broker host instead (needs root there):

   ```bash
   # black hole (timeout): device sees silence, its keepalive eventually fires the will
   iptables -I INPUT -s <device-ip> -p tcp --dport 1883 -j DROP
   # connection refused (TCP reset): device sees an immediate refusal
   iptables -I INPUT -s <device-ip> -p tcp --dport 1883 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
   ```

   The two are different tests: `DROP` is the "broker went away" black hole that
   exercises the last-will keepalive timeout; `REJECT` is the "broker actively
   refuses" path. Delete the rule (`-D` instead of `-I`) to restore. Prefer this
   over `/api/mqtt/stop` whenever the broker is not exclusively the DUT's.

3. **Test MQTT + WiFi together:**
   - Start AP + broker
   - `POST /api/wifi/ap_stop` — device loses both WiFi and MQTT
   - `POST /api/wifi/ap_start` + `POST /api/mqtt/start` — restore both
   - Verify device recovers

## A last-will topic is death-only — don't test for it "returning to online"

The MQTT Last Will is published by the **broker**, on the device's behalf, only
when the connection drops uncleanly. A device typically registers a retained
will like `<id>/LWT = offline` and signals *liveness* on a **separate** birth or
status topic (e.g. `<id>/STATUS {"online":true}`, republished on every connect
and periodically). Nothing ever writes `LWT = online` — the will topic stays
`offline` from the last drop until the next one.

So when checking recovery after an outage, watch for the **birth/status message
to be republished**, not for the will topic to flip back. And because the
retained will persists, a stale `offline` cannot be told apart from a freshly
fired one by reading the retained value — to prove a will *fired*, seed a
sentinel first (`mosquitto_pub -t <id>/LWT -r -m sentinel`), then confirm the
broker overwrites it with `offline` once the keepalive expires.

## A retained status read mid-outage is a stale corpse

`mosquitto_sub -C 1` on a retained status/telemetry topic returns the **last
published value**, which during (and right after) an outage is the copy from
*before* the device dropped — its counters are frozen. Reading it to judge
recovery gives a false negative: e.g. `mqtt_disconnects` still shows the
pre-outage number because the device has not reconnected and republished yet.

Judge recovery by the device **resuming live publishing**, not by the retained
value. Subscribe for longer than the publish cadence and require ≥2 arrivals
(the immediate retained copy, then at least one fresh publish); only then read
counters. An MQTT reconnect does **not** reset uptime, so "small uptime" cannot
stand in for "fresh" — only a live arrival can.

## Don't over-specify long black-hole durations

A spec that says "cut MQTT for 30 minutes" is usually testing "the device never
restarts on MQTT loss." Unlike WiFi (which often has a restart-after-N-minutes
rule), **MQTT loss typically has no restart timer at all** — so a few minutes
proves "never restarts" exactly as well as 30, and the extra 25 just confirm the
same nothing. Reserve long windows for behaviour actually gated on a long timer
(a WiFi restart rule, a WireGuard rekey/handshake expiry). Also: a
telemetry-drop counter can only grow if the device is **publishing telemetry**
that overflows — with no sensor/meter attached there is no stream, so that
sub-criterion is N/A on a bare bench and needs a data source (a fake-data build
or real hardware).

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Broker won't start | Check if mosquitto is installed on the testbench Pi |
| Device can't connect | Ensure device is on testbench WiFi; use broker IP `192.168.4.1` from AP clients |
| Broker status shows stopped | Start it with `POST /api/mqtt/start` |
| Device "never comes back online" | You are probably watching the `/LWT` will topic — it is death-only; watch the birth/status topic instead (see above) |
