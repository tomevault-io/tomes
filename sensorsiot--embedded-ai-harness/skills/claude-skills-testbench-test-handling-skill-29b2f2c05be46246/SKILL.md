Use it for authoring a pytest suite as well as for tracking a manual run. For driving one instrument, use that instrument's skill instead.

# ESP32 Test Automation

Base URL: `$TESTBENCH_URL` — see Step 0

**The portal and the MQTT broker are always-on infrastructure. A test never
starts, stops or restarts them** — doing so breaks whatever else is using the
bench, and a test that needs a restart to pass is testing the restart.

## The execution protocol

Every test case runs in three phases, and the panel shows which one is current so
the operator can follow along without a terminal.

| Phase | Panel shows | What happens |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Preconditions** | `[TC-100] Preconditions: checking DUT reachable...` | Verify **and establish** each precondition from the spec. If the AP is not running, start it. Fail only when a precondition is genuinely unrecoverable. |
| **Execute** | `[TC-100] Step 2: <the step from the spec>` | Run the spec's steps one at a time, checking the expected result after each. |
| **Result** | `TC-100: PASS` / `TC-100: FAIL — <what was seen>` | Record PASS/FAIL/SKIP with the observed value, not just the verdict. |

Rules that decide whether a run is worth anything:

1. **The spec is the script.** Execute its preconditions, steps and pass criteria
   as written — not an improved version of them.
2. **Update the panel before each action**, never after. The panel is how the
   operator knows what the bench is doing to the hardware right now.
3. **Record baselines.** Where the spec says "record X as `X_before`", capture it
   and compare in the result phase.
4. **Generate test credentials per run.** A random SSID and password for the test
   AP proves the DUT used what it was provisioned with, rather than a network it
   had already cached.
5. **Write the results out.** A markdown file with test ID, name, result, details
   and timestamps — the panel is live state, not a record.

Workflows that span several instruments — provision, reboot, re-provision, soak —
are in [`references/common-workflows.md`](references/common-workflows.md).

## Step 0: Point at a bench

There are several benches and their addresses move, so nothing here writes one
down. `$BENCH` is not usable either — a container cannot resolve mDNS.
Discover the bench and export its URL:

```bash
export TESTBENCH_URL=$(sudo python3 .claude/skills/esp-idf-handling/discover-testbench.py \
                         --url --name <bench-hostname>)
curl -s "$TESTBENCH_URL/api/info"        # confirm before anything else
```

`--url` refuses to guess when more than one bench answers, so `--name` is
required whenever a second bench is powered on. `TESTBENCH_URL` is the same
variable `pytest --wt-url` falls back to.

## Step 0.5: Reach the DUT through the API, never through raw RFC2217

The slots expose RFC2217 ports, and it is tempting to open one with pyserial
and read the device directly. **Do not do this to a DUT.** Use `/api/flash`,
`/api/serial/monitor`, `/api/serial/reset` and `/api/chip/info`, which
implement each chip's sequences correctly.

The reason is that **serial control lines are not inert on modern parts**. On
an ESP32-C3, -S3 or any native-USB device, the USB-Serial/JTAG controller
reads them as boot-mode signals: **DTR asserted selects download mode, RTS
asserted holds the part in reset**. pyserial asserts both on open by default,
and the Linux CDC-ACM driver asserts them too. So merely *connecting to look
at* a DUT can stop it — and what you then observe is your own connection, not
the firmware.

That failure is vicious because it is silent and it is self-confirming: the
device prints nothing, which reads as a crash or a hang; a reset appears to
fix it; and repeating the observation reproduces the silence, which feels like
evidence. On a UART-bridge part (CP2102, CH340) the same lines usually drive
an auto-reset circuit, so the effect is a restart rather than a halt — quieter
still, because the device looks alive.

**To write to a device, use `POST /api/serial/write`** (FR-030). It takes
`text` or `hex`, opens nothing, and disturbs no control line.

**The bench's own DUT answers.** `test-firmware/` gives the bench a device
that talks back, so a write can be *proved* to have arrived rather than
assumed. One line in, one line out, no echo and no prompt:

| Command | Reply | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `ping` | `OK pong` | the write reached the device |
| `status` | `OK status wifi=… ap_mode=… ip=… mac=…` | what the DUT thinks its network is |
| `scan` | `OK scan <n>`, then `<rssi> <ch> <auth> <ssid>` per line | **what the DUT's own radio can hear** |
| `info` | `OK info project=… version=… idf=…` | which image is *actually* running |
| `mark <text>` | `OK mark <text>` | an observable on demand, without waiting for the heartbeat |
| `wifi <ssid> [pass]` | `OK wifi stored …` then reboots | provision over the wire, no radio needed |
| `forget` / `reboot` | `OK …` then reboots | back to the portal / restart |

`scan` is the one worth reaching for first when a DUT will not join. The
bench can scan and the DUT could not, so a failure to meet had only one
witness — and `NO_AP_FOUND` from the DUT reads as the DUT's fault when it
is just as often the AP that is not on the air. Two radios reporting is a
measurement; one is an assertion.

`info` settles the other recurring waste of time: after a flash, ask the
device what it is running rather than inferring it from a log tail, which
may still hold the previous image's lines. Raw RFC2217 is
now only for a peer you are driving deliberately with a protocol the API
cannot express. When you do reach for it, the control lines must be low
**before** the port opens, not after:

```python
# The order is the whole point: opening first asserts the lines.
ser = serial.serial_for_url(url, do_not_open=True)
ser.baudrate = 115200
ser.dtr = False          # DTR asserted = download mode on native USB
ser.rts = False          # RTS asserted = held in reset
ser.open()               # only now, with both lines already low
```

This is exactly what the portal's own `serial_monitor()` does, and it is why
the portal can read a device that a naive client stops dead.

**Boot-time output is observable now**, by three routes, so a missed banner is
no longer a reason to reach for raw serial:

- `GET /api/serial/output?slot=…` — a recorder runs on every present slot
  whether or not anyone is watching, so the banner is already in the buffer
  by the time you ask. `lines=N` returns the **most recent** N of a
  1000-line ring; pass `since=<ts>` to get only what arrived after a moment
  you chose. Check the entries' `ts`: a buffer whose newest line is minutes
  old is telling you the device went quiet, which is itself the observation.
  (It once returned the *oldest* N, so a slot that had been up a while
  always answered with ancient history whose newest timestamp aged
  steadily — indistinguishable from a dead recorder. If you are reading an
  older bench and the tail never advances, that is the bug, not the device.)
- **the reset's own reply.** `POST /api/serial/reset` captures the boot while
  it performs it and returns those lines in `output` — the simplest route,
  and the one to reach for first.
- **the read-only fan-out**, `tcp_port + 1000` — a plain TCP stream of the
  same bytes, as many readers as you like, no control lines and no
  competition with the proxy's own client. Use it to watch a device that is
  already running. **Do not connect to it and then trigger a reset or a
  flash**: both stop and restart the proxy, so the socket dies and the
  capture comes back empty — which reads exactly like a silent device. The
  exception is a slot with a live debug session, where reset goes over JTAG
  and the proxy stays up.

Reset is not guaranteed to take on every part. If a device keeps counting
uptime across a `/api/serial/reset`, it did not reboot — check before
concluding anything about what it printed. And after a flash the recorder's
buffer starts again with the new proxy, so an old newest-line timestamp
there means the proxy was replaced, not that the device went quiet.

## Test Progress Tracking

Test scripts can push live progress updates to the testbench web UI so operators can monitor test execution without a terminal.

### Endpoints

Request and response shapes: [FSD Appendix D.13](../../../docs/Harness-FSD.md#d13-test-progress--human-interaction).

### Session Lifecycle

```bash
# 1. Start a test session
curl -X POST $TESTBENCH_URL/api/test/update \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"spec": "<test-spec> v1.0", "phase": "Phase 1", "total": 8}'

# 2. Update current test step
curl -X POST $TESTBENCH_URL/api/test/update \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"current": {"id": "TC-001", "name": "WiFi Provisioning", "step": "Joining AP...", "manual": false}}'

# 3. Record a result
curl -X POST $TESTBENCH_URL/api/test/update \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"result": {"id": "TC-001", "name": "WiFi Provisioning", "result": "PASS"}}'

# 4. End the session
curl -X POST $TESTBENCH_URL/api/test/update \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"end": true}'

# Poll current progress
curl $TESTBENCH_URL/api/test/progress
```

### Python Driver Methods

```python
wt.test_start("<test-spec> v1.0", "Phase 1", total=8)
wt.test_step("TC-001", "WiFi Provisioning", "Joining AP...", manual=False)
wt.test_result("TC-001", "WiFi Provisioning", "PASS")
wt.test_end()
```

## TestbenchDriver

**Inside this repo's suite there is nothing to set up** — `pytest/conftest.py`
provides a session-scoped `testbench` fixture. Take it as an argument:

```python
def test_boots_clean(testbench):
    testbench.serial_reset("SLOT1")
```

From a standalone script, put the testbench repo's `pytest/` on the path — the
repo's own location, not a copy under `/tmp`:

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "<testbench-repo>/pytest")
from testbench_driver import TestbenchDriver
wt = TestbenchDriver("$TESTBENCH_URL")
```

Then discover the slot rather than hard-coding one, because labels move with the
USB topology:

```python
dut = next(s for s in wt.get_devices() if s["present"])
SLOT = dut["label"]
```

**Use the driver when writing tests**; it gives typed responses, real error
handling and the slot `state` field. For a one-off operation at the prompt, reach
for the instrument skill and its `curl` instead — the driver is not worth an
import path. The methods worth knowing are in
[`references/driver-methods.md`](references/driver-methods.md); the full surface
is `pytest/testbench_driver.py`.

## Human Interaction

Some test steps require physical actions that cannot be automated — pressing a button, connecting a cable, power-cycling a device. The human interaction endpoint lets test scripts block until an operator confirms the action via the web UI.

### Endpoints

Request and response shapes: [FSD Appendix D.13](../../../docs/Harness-FSD.md#d13-test-progress--human-interaction).

`/api/human-interaction` **blocks the caller** until Done, Cancel or timeout — so
give it a timeout shorter than the client's own, or the client gives up first and
leaves the modal on screen with nothing waiting for it.

### Examples

```bash
# Request operator action (blocks until Done/Cancel/timeout)
curl -X POST $TESTBENCH_URL/api/human-interaction \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"message": "Connect USB cable to port 2 and click Done", "timeout": 120}'

# Check if a request is pending
curl $TESTBENCH_URL/api/human/status

# Operator confirms
curl -X POST $TESTBENCH_URL/api/human/done

# Operator cancels
curl -X POST $TESTBENCH_URL/api/human/cancel
```

### Responses

| Outcome | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Confirmed | `{"ok": true, "confirmed": true}` |
| Cancelled | `{"ok": true, "confirmed": false}` |
| Timeout | `{"ok": true, "confirmed": false, "timeout": true}` |

Only one request can be pending at a time. A second request while one is active returns `409 Conflict`.

### Python Driver Method

```python
wt.human_interaction("Press the reset button and click Done", timeout=60)
# Returns True if confirmed, False if cancelled or timed out
```

## Activity Log

Timestamped log of all testbench operations — hotplug events, WiFi operations, enter-portal steps, human interactions.

### Endpoints

Request and response shapes: [FSD Appendix D.14](../../../docs/Harness-FSD.md#d14-activity-log).

```bash
# Get all entries
curl -s $TESTBENCH_URL/api/log | jq .

# Get entries since a timestamp
curl -s "$TESTBENCH_URL/api/log?since=2025-01-01T00:00:00Z" | jq .
```

## Common Workflows

1. **Run automated test suite with progress tracking:**
   - `POST /api/test/update` with `spec`, `phase`, `total` — start session
   - For each test: update step → run test → record result
   - `POST /api/test/update` with `end: true` — end session
   - Operator monitors on web UI (progress bar, results with PASS/FAIL/SKIP badges)

2. **Test requiring physical action:**
   - `POST /api/human-interaction` with instruction message
   - Web UI shows pulsing orange modal with the message
   - Operator performs action, clicks Done
   - Test script continues

3. **Monitor testbench operations:**
   - `GET /api/log?since=<ts>` — poll for new activity entries
   - Useful for debugging enter-portal sequences and tracking what happened

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Human interaction returns 409 | Another request is pending — wait or cancel it |
| Test progress not showing in UI | Ensure a session was started with `spec`, `phase`, `total` |
| Activity log empty | No operations have been performed yet |
