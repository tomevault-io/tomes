# Project Guidelines

## Commits & PRs

Never mention Claude, Claude Code, or any AI assistant in commit messages, PR titles, PR descriptions, or PR comments. No `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` trailers, no "🤖 Generated with Claude Code" footers, no references to AI tooling anywhere in version control history. Write commits and PRs as if a human wrote them.

## Icons

Always use **HugeIcons** for all icons. Never use `lucide-react`, inline SVGs, or any other icon library.

```tsx
import { HugeiconsIcon } from "@hugeicons/react"
import { SomeIcon } from "@hugeicons/core-free-icons"

<HugeiconsIcon icon={SomeIcon} size={16} />
```

## UI Components & Styling

- Always use **shadcn/ui** components with their default styling (`Button`, `Input`, `Select`, `Accordion`, etc.)
- **Never hand-write UI components.** Always add new components via the shadcn CLI:
  ```bash
  cd packages/ui && bunx shadcn@latest add <component>
  ```
- Never use raw Radix UI primitives directly — always wrap them in shadcn-style components from `@workspace/ui/components/*`
- Never use raw HTML `<input>`, `<button>`, `<select>`, etc. with custom styling unless explicitly requested
- Always use **Tailwind** utility classes for layout and spacing — no inline styles unless required by a third-party API (e.g. Remotion player dimensions)
- The `Accordion` component in `@workspace/ui/components/accordion` uses minimal sidebar-friendly defaults (no border/rounded-2xl on root, no heavy padding on trigger). Use `className` overrides to adapt for card-style contexts if needed.

## Type Checking

Always run `bun run tsc --noEmit` (or `bun run --cwd <package> tsc --noEmit`) after completing any changes and fix all new TypeScript errors before reporting done.

## Universal Clip Style — every composition exposes the same 4 controls

Every clip in the Studio gets a "Style" section in the Inspector with **four
universal controls** that work on any non-locked composition:

- Background color
- Text color
- Font (Google Fonts picker)
- Accent color

The user expects these to *always* be there when they click a clip. Don't
hide them. Don't bake them into per-component fields. They're handled by the
shared infrastructure, not by individual `meta.ts` files.

### Architecture (don't break this)

- **`apps/remotion/src/clip-style.ts`** — declares `ClipStyle` (the four
  optional fields) and `resolveClipStyle(override, defaults)` helper. Empty
  strings count as "no override".
- **`apps/remotion/src/project.ts`** — `Clip.style?: ClipStyle` lives on
  every clip. The Studio reducer's `UPDATE_CLIP_STYLE` / `RESET_CLIP_STYLE`
  actions write here.
- **`apps/remotion/src/compositions/Project/Project.tsx`** — forwards
  `clip.style` to the rendered component as a `clipStyle` prop, **only for
  non-locked compositions**. Locked compositions never receive the prop.

### How to wire a new composition

Every new composition opts into universal styling with three lines:

```tsx
import { type ClipStyle, resolveClipStyle } from "../../clip-style";

export type FooProps = {
  // ...composition-specific props (text, value, theme, etc.)
  clipStyle?: ClipStyle;
};

export const Foo: React.FC<FooProps> = ({ /* ... */, clipStyle }) => {
  const s = resolveClipStyle(clipStyle, {
    background: "#f7f7f9",     // your composition's natural defaults
    color: "#0f1014",
    fontFamily: "-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif",
    accent: "#6366f1",
  });

  return (
    <AbsoluteFill style={{ background: s.background, color: s.color, fontFamily: s.fontFamily }}>
      {/* use s.accent for highlights / icons / springs */}
    </AbsoluteFill>
  );
};
```

**Critical rules:**

1. Use the prop name `clipStyle` (NOT `style` — collides with React's HTML
   style prop and React will pass it through to DOM nodes by accident).
2. Call `resolveClipStyle()` at the top of the component and reference the
   returned `s.background / s.color / s.fontFamily / s.accent` everywhere
   you'd previously have used hardcoded values.
3. Do **not** add per-clip `accentColor` / `backgroundColor` / `fontFamily`
   fields to the composition's `meta.ts` `fields` array. The universal Style
   section handles all four. Per-component fields are only for
   composition-specific content (text, value, layout, etc.).
4. The first argument to `resolveClipStyle` is `clipStyle` (the override);
   the second is the composition's natural defaults. Don't swap them.

### Brand-locked compositions (impersonators)

Compositions that mimic real apps **opt out** of universal styling so they
keep their authentic look. Mark them with `brandMode: "locked"` in `meta.ts`:

```ts
export const tweetCardInfo: CompositionInfo<TweetCardProps> = {
  // ...
  brandMode: "locked",
};
```

A locked composition:

- Does **not** declare a `clipStyle?: ClipStyle` prop.
- Does **not** import `clip-style.ts`.
- Hardcodes its authentic colors/fonts (Twitter blue, WhatsApp green, etc.).

The Studio's Inspector hides the Style section for locked compositions, and
`Project.tsx` does not forward the `clipStyle` prop to them. Currently
locked: `TweetCard`, `TwitterFollow`, `WhatsAppMessages`, `SlackMessages`,
`DiscordMessages`, `MessageBubbles`, `MessagePopup`.

## Remotion Composition Registry

`apps/remotion/src/components.ts` uses a two-level split to avoid circular dependencies:

- **`componentsBase.ts`** — standalone compositions that do NOT import `componentsById` or `componentsByIdBase`. Add new plain compositions here.
- **`components.ts`** — spreads `componentsByIdBase` and adds wrapper compositions (`PhoneFrame`, `LaptopFrame`, `SplitScene`) that need to look up other compositions at render time.

Wrapper compositions (any component that embeds other compositions via `componentsByIdBase`) must:
1. Import from `componentsBase.ts`, never from `components.ts`
2. Live in `components.ts` (not in `componentsBase.ts`)

Violating this causes a circular-import TDZ crash at runtime.

## Adding a Composition — Required Sync Points

When you add a new composition under `apps/remotion/src/compositions/<Name>/`, **all** of these must be updated in the same change. Skipping any one of them leaves the composition partially wired (silently missing from docs, broken in the studio, or invisible in the registry):

1. **`apps/remotion/src/compositions/<Name>/<Name>.tsx`** — the React component.
2. **`apps/remotion/src/compositions/<Name>/meta.ts`** — exports `<name>Info: CompositionInfo<Props>` with `id`, `title`, `description`, dimensions, `defaultProps`, `fields`. The `id` must be a unique PascalCase string.
3. **`apps/remotion/src/registry.ts`** — import the `<name>Info` and add it to the `compositions` array. This drives the studio Library, the docs sidebar, and `generateStaticParams` for `/docs/[id]` and `/component/[id]/edit`.
4. **`apps/remotion/src/componentsBase.ts`** (or **`components.ts`** for wrapper compositions) — import the component and add it to `componentsByIdBase` (or the wrapper map). The `<Project>` composition and the renderer look the component up by `id` from this map; missing here = silent black screen in the timeline / studio export.
5. **`apps/web/content/docs/<kebab-name>.mdx`** — docs page. Mirror an existing one: `meta` export with `title`, `description`, `toc`, plus the `<Preview id />`, `<EditorLink id />`, `<PropsTable id />`, `<CompositionStats id />` blocks. The filename is the kebab-case form of the id.
6. **`apps/web/lib/docs.ts`** — import the MDX module + `meta as <camel>Meta`, then add a `Doc` entry with `slug` (= the composition id), `href` (`/docs/<id>`), `meta`, and `Content`. Order matters: the entry's position determines prev/next nav order.

Quick sanity check after the change:

```bash
# Every registered composition id should also appear as a slug in lib/docs.ts.
grep '  id:' apps/remotion/src/compositions/*/meta.ts \
  | grep -oE '"[^"]+"' | tr -d '"' | sort -u > /tmp/ids.txt
grep -oE 'slug: "[A-Z][a-zA-Z]+"' apps/web/lib/docs.ts \
  | sed 's/slug: "//;s/"$//' | sort -u > /tmp/slugs.txt
comm -23 /tmp/ids.txt /tmp/slugs.txt   # should print nothing
```

If that command prints anything, those compositions are registered in Remotion but don't have a docs page wired up.
