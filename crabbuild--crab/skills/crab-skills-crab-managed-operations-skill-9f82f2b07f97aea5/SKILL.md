# Crab managed operations

Keep identity, service selection, authorization, resource ownership, audit, and
release evidence explicit. A successful API response is not enough: verify the
selected service and the resulting state.

## Authentication

1. Resolve the service origin and provider before login. Use device flow for
   headless sessions and an explicit enterprise CA only when required.
2. Store tokens in the supported credential store; never print them or place
   them in arguments, logs, JSON reports, or generated manifests.
3. `auth status` is read-only. `logout` must make clear whether it removes one
   service/provider or all cached credentials.
4. For static or cloud-provider authentication, validate audience, region,
   certificate, clock, and permission failures separately.

## Administration

- Before create/update/delete, confirm service, organization, repository,
  member, actor, and requested ownership change.
- Read current state, use idempotency keys for creates/jobs and the returned
  revision for `If-Match` mutations. Do not silently rename, archive, restore,
  delete, or transfer ownership.
- Treat service-account keys and one-time secrets as write-only material. Show
  only identifiers and redacted status after creation.
- Keep pagination, retry, rate limits, and authorization failures distinct in
  errors so automation can decide whether to retry.

## Managed transfer boundary

- Resolve a logical repository through the managed service. The client must
  not learn or persist its physical prefix or canonical provider credential.
- Clone, fetch, and hydrate request short-lived, repository- and
  operation-scoped read grants. A protected push first prepares a session and
  `push_upload` staging grant, uploads immutable objects, then finalizes the
  exact request digest through the service.
- Finalize is the publication authority. An upload or successful HTTP response
  before finalize does not advance refs. Abort uncommitted sessions when safe;
  retry a timed-out request with its idempotency identity rather than creating
  an unrelated push.
- Managed and direct-storage modes have different authorities. Never fall back
  from a denied or unavailable managed request to ambient bucket credentials.

## Audit and releases

- Local `audit log/verify/export` operates on `.crab/audit/events.jsonl` and
  its digest-protected events. Managed audit query/export is a tenant service
  API. Do not claim the local file is the managed tenant ledger.
- `release create/verify/export/list` binds a Git revision to pointer inventory,
  workflow metadata, parameters, metrics, and optional detached signatures;
  `--publish` stores a named manifest in the repository release namespace.
- Release creation should reject unintended dirty state. A forced override is
  an explicit policy decision and must appear in evidence.
- Deep verification reconstructs pointer-backed files and checks identity; JSON
  parsing alone is not content proof.
- Export preserves signatures, identity metadata, and byte content. Verify the
  exported artifact from a clean consumer.

## Verification

Test expired and missing credentials, wrong service, insufficient permission,
duplicate creation, membership removal, audit tampering, invalid signatures,
and deep release verification. Redact all secrets in captured output and
record the actor, resource, revision, and resulting audit event.
