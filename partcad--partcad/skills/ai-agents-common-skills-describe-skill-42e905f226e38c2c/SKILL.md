description: Write a narratable, accessibility-oriented text description of an existing PartCAD part, assembly, or sketch by rendering it from several viewing angles - and, where it is available, from a dimensioned technical drawing - then examining the results. Use for /pc:describe or when the user asks to describe, summarize, or caption a PartCAD object. Reproduces the retired built-in AI shape-summary. Use when this capability is needed.

# pc:describe

Produce a text description of an existing PartCAD shape by rendering it and
looking at the result — the replacement for PartCAD's retired built-in AI
summary. The text after the command (`$ARGUMENTS`) names the object to describe
(optionally with its kind).

One picture is not enough to describe a shape. A single projection hides
everything behind it, and a description written from one is a description of a
silhouette. Render **three views** (§2), and where a dimensioned drawing can be
had, read the numbers off that rather than estimating them (§3).

## 1. Resolve the object

`$ARGUMENTS` is the object name (a part by default; an assembly or sketch if the
user says so). Read its `desc:`/`requirements:` from `partcad.yaml` for context.
Make sure PartCAD is available as `/pc:init` describes.

Pass `--no-ansi` on every run so the output is plain text; it is a global flag,
goes before the subcommand, and routes the logs to stderr.

This skill describes an object a package declares, because §5 stores the result
back into that package. To describe a bare CAD file that is in no package, render
it with `/pc:render` (`pc adhoc render`) and write the description for the user
instead of storing it.

## 2. Render three views

`front`, `top` and `iso`: two orthographic views to read proportion and features
from, and one pictorial view that shows how they go together. A rendered file is
named after the object, so give each view a directory of its own or they
overwrite each other:

```sh
for view in front top iso; do
  mkdir -p /tmp/pc-render/$view
  pc --no-ansi render -t png --view $view -O /tmp/pc-render/$view <name>   # add -a for an assembly
done
```

View all three — `/tmp/pc-render/<view>/<name>.png`.

Add `right` (or `back`, `left`, `bottom`) when the three leave a face
unaccounted for: a part that is not symmetric about an axis has a side you have
not seen, and guessing at it is exactly what this skill must not do.

A **sketch** is flat, so it has only one view worth rendering, and SVG suits it
better than PNG:

```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/pc-render
pc --no-ansi render -s -t svg -O /tmp/pc-render <name>
```

## 3. Render a dimensioned drawing (parts, when it is available)

The projections above show shape but no numbers. `draftwright`, a render
implementation published in the public PartCAD index, draws a **fully dimensioned
technical drawing** instead — orthographic views with dimension lines, hole
callouts, radii, an ISO view, and a title block carrying the material and scale.
Reading a description off that beats estimating from pixels:

```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/pc-render/drawing
pc --no-ansi render -t pdf -e //pub/feature/render/draftwright \
    -O /tmp/pc-render/drawing <name>
```

`-e` names the package to read the output configuration from, so this works on
any object without that object's package knowing about draftwright. Then read
`/tmp/pc-render/drawing/<name>.pdf` — ask for **`pdf`**, whose pages can be
looked at directly. Its `svg` draws every character as paths, so no text can be
read out of that markup.

This is a best-effort extra, not a requirement. It needs the public index among
the package's `dependencies:` (which `pc init` writes) and a network connection,
and the first run is slow while PartCAD installs draftwright into a sandbox. It
is also a *part* drawing — do not expect it of an assembly or a sketch.

draftwright reports what it could not do. When a part has features it cannot
dimension at the chosen scale it says so and draws the rest, and the command may
exit non-zero having still written a usable file — so check whether the file
appeared before giving up on it. If it did not, or anything above failed,
describe the object from the three views and say in your report that no
dimensioned drawing was available.

## 4. Write the description

From the images plus the configured `desc`/`requirements`, write a description
for a reader who has a mechanical-engineering / CAD background but cannot see it:

- Describe both the overall shape and the dimensions; make no assumptions and
  add as much concrete detail as the renders and config support.
- Prefer a dimension the drawing states over one you judged from a projection.
  Where you are reading a proportion off a picture rather than a stated number,
  say it is approximate rather than inventing a figure.
- Work through the views: overall form and bounding size first, then the
  features each view reveals, then how they relate.
- Refer to it as "this design", not "the image" — and never as "the three
  images", which is an artifact of how you looked at it.
- Produce prose that is ready to be narrated as-is (no markdown, no lists).

## 5. Persist it (so `pc inspect` shows it)

`pc inspect` reads a shape's `summary:` from its configuration. Write your
description there so the tool and other agents can reuse it:

```yaml
parts:            # or sketches: / assemblies:
  <name>:
    ...
    summary: >-
      <your description>
```

Report the description to the user, say which views (and whether a dimensioned
drawing) it was written from, and confirm where you stored it.
