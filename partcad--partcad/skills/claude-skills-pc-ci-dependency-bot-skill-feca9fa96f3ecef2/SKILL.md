Sweep the open dependency-bot pull requests once: rebase the stale ones, re-trigger
infrastructure failures, and merge the ones that are green and in scope.

**This skill performs a single pass and exits.** It never sleeps and never loops
internally. To baby sit continuously, drive it from the loop skill:

```
/loop 1h pc-ci-dependency-bot
```

Each firing is a fresh session with no memory of the last one, so every piece of state
this skill relies on is re-read from the GitHub API rather than carried in context.

**Scope:** GitHub only. The triage below is built on `gh` and on dependabot's comment
commands. GitLab and Gerrit are not supported — stop and say so rather than improvising
an equivalent.

**Input:** Optionally a repository (URL or `OWNER/NAME`). Defaults to the current
working directory's repository.

## Steps

### 1. Select the repository

If the user named a repository, use it. Otherwise infer it from the conversation, then
fall back to `git remote get-url origin`. If it is still ambiguous, ask with the
**AskUserQuestion** tool.

Announce the choice and how to change it:

```
Using upstream: <owner/name> — re-run with `pc-ci-dependency-bot <owner/name>` to target another repository.
```

Pass the repository explicitly on every `gh` call (`--repo <owner/name>`) so the skill
behaves identically inside and outside a checkout.

### 2. List the open bot pull requests

```bash
gh pr list --repo <owner/name> --state open --author "app/dependabot" \
  --json number,title,url,headRefName,mergeStateStatus,labels
```

If the list is empty, report "No open dependency-bot pull requests" and **exit**. Do not
wait — the next `/loop` firing is the wait.

Note that this repository configures dependabot for `github-actions` on a **monthly**
interval (`.github/dependabot.yml`), so most passes will find nothing. That is the
expected outcome, not a failure.

Then handle each pull request with steps 3–6. A pull request that gets an action in step
3 is done for this pass; move to the next one.

### 3. Bring the pull request up to date first

CI results from before a base-branch move describe a merge that no longer exists, so
settle freshness before reading any logs.

Read `mergeStateStatus` from step 2:

- **`BEHIND`** — the branch is out of date. Ask dependabot to rebase and move on to the
  next pull request; the new runs are evaluated on a later pass:

  ```bash
  gh pr comment <number> --repo <owner/name> --body "@dependabot rebase"
  ```

  Do not re-comment if the most recent comment on the pull request is already an
  unactioned `@dependabot rebase` — check with
  `gh pr view <number> --repo <owner/name> --json comments`. Dependabot queues these, and
  repeating the request hourly spams the thread without changing anything.

- **`DIRTY`** — the branch conflicts with the base. Dependabot cannot rebase through a
  conflict. Report it under "Needs attention" and move on.

- **`BLOCKED`** — a required review or check is missing, or branch protection is
  unsatisfied. Continue to step 4; the merge in step 6 will surface the real reason.

- **`CLEAN`, `UNSTABLE`, `HAS_HOOKS`** — up to date. Continue to step 4.

### 4. Read the check status

```bash
gh pr checks <number> --repo <owner/name> --json name,state,bucket,link
```

The `bucket` field categorises each check as `pass`, `fail`, `pending`, `skipping`, or
`cancel`.

- Any check in `pending` — the pull request is still building. Skip it this pass and
  report it as pending.
- All checks in `pass` or `skipping` — go to step 6.
- Any check in `fail` or `cancel` — go to step 5.

### 5. Triage the failures

For each failing check, read enough of the log to classify it:

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --repo <owner/name> --log-failed
```

**Re-trigger only failures that are not caused by the pull request** — network timeouts,
runner eviction, registry rate limits, corrupted package downloads and similar
infrastructure noise. Compile errors, test assertions and lint violations are caused by
the change: leave them, and report the pull request under "Needs attention".

Before re-triggering, check how many attempts the run has already had. The attempt
counter lives in the API, which is what makes it survive across `/loop` firings:

```bash
gh run list --repo <owner/name> --branch <headRefName> \
  --json databaseId,workflowName,conclusion,status,attempt
```

`attempt` is 1 for a run that has never been re-triggered. **Re-trigger at most 3 times**
— if `attempt >= 4`, stop re-triggering that run and report the pull request under "Needs
attention" instead. A failure that survives three re-runs is not flaky, whatever the log
looks like.

```bash
gh run rerun <run-id> --repo <owner/name> --failed
```

A re-trigger completes this pull request for this pass; the result is evaluated on a
later firing.

### 6. Merge what is in scope

Only reached when every check passes.

**Check the version jump before merging.** Dependabot titles carry it, in the form
`bump <dependency> from <old> to <new>`. Compare the leading numeric component:

- **Patch or minor bump** — approve and merge:

  ```bash
  gh pr review <number> --repo <owner/name> --approve
  gh pr merge <number> --repo <owner/name> --squash
  ```

- **Major bump** (leading component differs, e.g. `from 4 to 8`) — **do not merge.**
  Green CI does not prove a major bump is safe; it proves the parts covered by CI still
  run. Report it under "Needs attention" with the old and new versions and let a human
  decide.

- **Version unparseable from the title** — treat it as a major bump and report it.

If the merge is rejected (branch protection, required reviewers, a merge queue), report
the error verbatim rather than working around it.

## Output

Report every pull request examined, then exit.

```
Using upstream: <owner/name> — re-run with `pc-ci-dependency-bot <owner/name>` to target another repository.

## PR #<number> — <title>
<what was found and what was done>
✓ <Merged | Rebase requested | Re-triggered (attempt N of 3) | Pending>

## PR #<number> — <title>
<what was found and what was done>
✓ <action>

---
Swept N pull requests: <x> merged, <y> awaiting CI, <z> need attention.
```

If any pull request needs a human:

```
## Needs attention

**PR:** #<number> — <title>
**URL:** <url>

### Issue
<what is blocking it: conflict, real test failure, exhausted retries, or major version bump>

**Options:**
1. <option 1>
2. <option 2>
3. Other approach
```

End the pass there. Do not ask a blocking question and do not wait for an answer — a
`/loop` firing has no one to answer it. Report the options and exit; the user acts
between firings.

## Guardrails

- One pass per invocation. Never sleep, never restart from step 1.
- Never re-trigger a run that is already on its 4th attempt.
- Never re-trigger a failure the pull request actually caused.
- Report blockers and exit rather than guessing or working around branch protection.
