Operating manual for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## About The Project

`cloakbrowser-mcp` is a stdio MCP bridge for upstream `@playwright/mcp`. It starts upstream Playwright MCP as a child process, injects the CloakBrowser Chromium executable through a generated Playwright MCP config, forwards upstream tools unchanged, and adds only two local introspection tools.

- Runtime: Node.js `^22.13.0 || >=24.0.0`, ES modules, TypeScript `strict` with `NodeNext`.
- Public surface: CLI package only, `bin: cloakbrowser-mcp`.
- Docker base: pinned official Playwright MCP image from `Dockerfile`.

## Golden Rules

1. Write the simplest possible code. Do only what was requested.
2. Use the `context7` MCP tool whenever you need up-to-date documentation or API references for external libraries.
3. Everything in this repository is written in English.
4. AI-agent reasoning and code-agent reasoning for this repository must be in English.
5. Do not copy, rewrite, or mutate upstream Playwright MCP browser tool contracts.

## Daily Commands

```bash
npm run dev
npm test
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run format
npm run format:check
npm run build
npm run package:verify
npm run docker:build
npm run docker:smoke
npm run bridge:compare
npm run check
```

`npm run check` must pass before any change is considered done.

## TypeScript

- Keep `strict` mode on.
- ESM only. Internal imports end with `.js`.
- Use configured aliases for internal imports instead of relative paths:
  `#src/...` for runtime source, `@/...` for source imports in tests,
  `@tests/...` for test helpers, and `#scripts/...` for scripts.
- Prefer explicit types and small pure functions.
- Do not use `console.*` in runtime code. CLI help/version may write to `process.stdout`; errors may write to `process.stderr`.
- Do not add `any`, `// @ts-ignore`, or non-null assertions to silence the checker.

## Bridge Rules

- Upstream Playwright MCP tools are forwarded unchanged.
- Local tools are limited to `cloakbrowser_binary_info` and `cloakbrowser_bridge_info`.
- `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_*` is the primary configuration namespace.
- `CLOAK_PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_*` is only for bridge-specific Cloak toggles.
- Do not add `CLOAKBROWSER_MCP_*` aliases.
- Do not restore the old native adapter, custom capability model, origin policy, artifact manager, verify helpers, or custom browser tools.

## Tests

- Vitest.
- Unit tests live under `tests/unit/`.
- Integration tests live under `tests/integration/`.
- Use the fake upstream MCP server for proxy behavior.
- Tests must write only to `tmpdir()` paths they create and clean up.
- Prefer property-based tests for parsers, option normalization, environment
  handling, and other boundary-heavy pure logic.

## Agent Skills And Workflow Routing

Repository-owned skills live under `.agents/skills/`. Use the matching skill
when its frontmatter description routes the current request; do not invoke a
specialized workflow merely because its files exist.

- Review and refactoring: `code-review-and-quality`, `code-simplification`,
  `performance-optimization`, and `security-and-hardening`.
- Discovery and durable context: `context-engineering`,
  `documentation-and-adrs`, `project-docs-maintainer`,
  `doubt-driven-development`, `idea-refine`, and `interview-me`.
- Specification delivery: `spec-driven-development`,
  `planning-and-task-breakdown`, and `incremental-implementation`.
- GitHub delivery: `project-pull-request` and `project-release`.

The authoritative slash-command routes are:

- `/spec` -> `.agents/skills/spec-driven-development/SKILL.md`
- `/plan` -> `.agents/skills/planning-and-task-breakdown/SKILL.md`

Do not create a second implementation of either route. For substantial
workstreams, store the contract and execution artifacts under
`docs/specs/<slug>/` and follow:

- `.agents/references/specification-interview.md` for Prompt MCP interviews,
  decision persistence, recovery, and specification approval;
- `.agents/references/task-packets.md` for planning and one-packet execution.

Whenever a repository-owned skill needs a material user decision, use the
globally configured Prompt MCP instead of a plain-chat multiple-choice
question. Inspect the callable schema, use the repository's absolute path as
`workspace_path`, prefer `workspace` persistence for recoverable workflows,
and use stable semantic IDs. A cancellation, timeout, unavailability,
conflict, invalid request, or failure is not an answer. Never request or
persist credentials, tokens, passwords, secrets, or unrelated personal data.

Create `docs/specs/<slug>/decisions.yaml` before the first material `/spec`
question. The repository ledger is the durable decision authority; Prompt MCP
persistence is the interaction recovery mechanism. Reload both after
compaction or handoff. Keep `spec.md` at `Status: Draft` until a separate
Prompt MCP approval answer explicitly selects `approve`. `/spec` stops before
planning, and `/plan` stops before implementation.

## Supply Chain And GitHub Security

- Keep GitHub workflow permissions least-privilege: use top-level
  `contents: read`, and declare write permissions only on the specific job that
  needs them.
- Pin external GitHub Actions by full commit SHA. Keep the intended upstream
  version in a trailing comment, for example `# v6`, so updates remain
  reviewable.
- Pin Docker images used by the Dockerfile and workflows with `tag@sha256:...`
  references. Preserve the readable tag next to the digest.
- Use image reference variables such as `NODE_IMAGE_REF` for pinned image refs;
  avoid tag-only variables for build inputs.
- When changing the pinned upstream Playwright MCP image, keep
  `scripts/lib/playwright-mcp-upstream.mjs` able to read the tag from a
  `tag@sha256:...` value.
- Do not disable zizmor or OpenSSF Scorecard findings broadly. Suppress only a
  narrowly scoped finding with a clear reason.
- Run actionlint and zizmor after workflow, Docker, token permission, or
  registry publishing changes:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/repo" --workdir /repo docker.io/rhysd/actionlint:1.7.12@sha256:b1934ee5f1c509618f2508e6eb47ee0d3520686341fec936f3b79331f9315667 -color
python3 -m pipx run zizmor --min-severity high .
```

- Keep `SECURITY.md` actionable with a private vulnerability reporting path.
- Repository settings such as branch protection, rulesets, required reviewers,
  and required checks are maintainer-controlled. Do not change them without
  explicit confirmation of the exact policy.

## Documentation

Update `README.md`, `docs/getting-started.md`, `docs/configuration.md`, `docs/docker.md`, or `docs/tools.md` when public CLI, Docker, environment, or tool-surface behavior changes.

English documentation is the source of truth for localized MkDocs pages. When
changing human-authored Markdown under `docs/`, update every localized suffix
file (`*.ru.md`, `*.be.md`, `*.uk.md`, `*.es.md`, `*.pt-BR.md`, `*.zh.md`,
`*.ja.md`, `*.de.md`, `*.fr.md`, and `*.hi.md`) or explicitly document why a
locale is deferred. Do not use `npm run docs:translations` or
`scripts/update-doc-translations.mjs` to bulk-regenerate localized pages unless
the maintainer explicitly asks for that script. Instead, inspect the English
`git diff`, identify only the changed human-readable fragments, translate those
fragments with DeepL MCP `translate_text` when it is available, and patch the
corresponding localized files surgically. If DeepL is unavailable, returns a
quota or service error, or cannot translate a locale, manually translate those
same fragments with the LLM. Translate changed headings, prose, list items, and
table prose; remove localized text when the English source removes it. Preserve Markdown
structure, frontmatter keys, code blocks, inline code, URLs, environment
variables, CLI flags, JSON keys, tool names, package names, image paths, and
Material icon tokens exactly. For Markdown tables, translate only prose cells
that changed; do not reformat the table or translate identifiers/default values.
After localized files are truly updated, refresh only the relevant entries in
`docs/data/translation-manifest.json` so the touched source file hashes and
translation hashes match the actual files; never update the manifest to hide
stale or untranslated content. Run `npm run docs:build`,
`npm run docs:seo:validate`, `npm run docs:translations:check`, and
`npm run check` before committing documentation changes.

Compatibility tables are generated from `docs/data/version-compatibility.json`. For release work, add the new compatibility row there, run `npm run docs:compatibility`, and verify both the full table in `docs/version-compatibility.md` and the compact compatibility table in `README.md` are updated. Run `npm run docs:compatibility:check` before finishing so the generated tables in `README.md`, `docs/index.md`, and `docs/version-compatibility.md` cannot drift.

`CHANGELOG.md` must follow Keep a Changelog `1.1.0`. The pinned specification URL is `https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/`. Before editing release notes, open and scan that specification, then write human-readable entries in reverse chronological order with an `[Unreleased]` section, ISO dates, comparison links, and standard sections such as `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, and `Security`.

## Commit And PR Hygiene

- One logical change per commit.
- Before creating a commit for local changes, ask the user for explicit confirmation that the commit should be created.
- Commit messages must follow Conventional Commits `1.0.0`.
- The pinned specification URL is `https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/`.
- Before creating a commit, open and scan the pinned specification, then choose the commit `type`, optional `scope`, optional breaking-change marker, subject, body, and footers according to that version.
- Use lowercase conventional types such as `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `ci`, `build`, `refactor`, `perf`, `style`, or `chore` when they match the change.
- Keep commit subjects concise, imperative, and present tense after the conventional prefix.
- Bump `version` only when explicitly asked.
- Call out security-sensitive changes in the PR description.

## Things Not To Do

- Do not add dependencies you do not import.
- Do not introduce a bundler or new runtime without explicit approval.
- Do not write MCP runtime logs to `stdout`.
- Do not commit `dist/`, `coverage/`, `artifacts/`, `site/`, `.venv-docs/`, or `node_modules/`.
- Do not weaken TypeScript, ESLint, or Prettier configuration.
