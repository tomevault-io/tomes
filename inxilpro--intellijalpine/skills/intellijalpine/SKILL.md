# IntelliJ Platform SDK Skill

Use this skill for **IntelliJ Platform plugin development** based on the modern **v2 SDK**.

This skill is intentionally split into focused references so the main file stays small and the model can load only the material relevant to the task.

## What this skill helps with

- creating or updating IntelliJ Platform plugins
- configuring `build.gradle.kts`, `settings.gradle.kts`, and `plugin.xml`
- implementing actions, services, tool windows, settings, and notifications
- working with PSI, references, indexing, VFS, and dumb mode
- building custom language support
- implementing inspections, intentions, quick fixes, completion, formatting, and documentation
- testing plugins and preparing Marketplace publication
- handling version compatibility and Gradle plugin migration

## How to use this skill

First, identify the user’s real task. Then read only the relevant reference files.

- caching with `CachedValuesManager`

### Read `references/language-support-and-analysis.md` when the task is about

- custom language plugins
- lexer, parser, `ParserDefinition`
- syntax highlighting, annotators, completion
- inspections, intentions, quick fixes
- rename refactoring, rename validation, safe delete
- formatter, folding, structure view, documentation provider
- parameter info, spell checking, navigation bar integration
- inlay hints, code vision
- language injection
- Symbols API and declarations/references model
- Poly Symbols and Web Types for web-framework metadata
- DocumentationTarget API
- `OptPane`, declarative inspection options, `OptionController`

### Read `references/ui-settings-and-toolwindows.md` when the task is about

- Kotlin UI DSL v2 (`panel { row { } }`, `BoundConfigurable`)
- dialogs and IntelliJ UI components
- tool windows
- settings/configurables
- persistent state
- notifications
- popups (`JBPopup`, `ListPopup`, chooser popups)
- new project wizard, module type, project view integration
- status bar widgets
- editor notification banners
- persisting sensitive data (`PasswordSafe`)
- embedded editor components (`EditorTextField`)

### Read `references/testing-and-publishing.md` when the task is about

- test fixtures and plugin tests
- integration tests or UI tests
- Starter/Driver-based test setup

- build compatibility
- `sinceBuild` / `untilBuild`
- migrating from legacy Gradle plugin 1.x to 2.x
- API changes across platform versions
- Java/Kotlin version expectations
- Workspace Model migration or newer platform API transitions

### Read `references/extension_points.md` when the task is about

- exact `plugin.xml` registration syntax
- locating the right extension point
- action group IDs and XML patterns
- MCP extension points such as `com.intellij.mcpServer.*`

### Read `references/code_samples.md` when the task is about

- finding the closest official SDK sample
- copying an official implementation pattern
- understanding what each JetBrains sample demonstrates

### Read `references/lsp.md` when the task is about

- integrating a Language Server into an IntelliJ Platform plugin
- `LspServerSupportProvider`, `LspServerDescriptor`, or LSP-specific `plugin.xml` dependencies
- LSP setup for supported JetBrains IDE products and platform versions in plugin-development context
- LSP feature support timeline inside the IntelliJ Platform
- deciding between LSP integration and native IntelliJ language support for a plugin

### Read `references/mcp-and-ai-integration.md` when the task is about

- MCP-related plugin integration in an IntelliJ Platform plugin
- contributing MCP tools or defining MCP toolsets
- understanding MCP-related extension points such as `com.intellij.mcpServer.*`

### Read `references/troubleshooting.md` when the task is about

- you are not yet sure which troubleshooting bucket the issue belongs to
- actions not appearing

- verifier warnings
- test setup failures

### Read `references/troubleshooting-build-runtime.md` when the task is about

- Gradle or repository resolution failures
- `plugin.xml` wiring or class loading issues
- action registration/runtime visibility issues

### Read `references/troubleshooting-psi-ui-testing.md` when the task is about

- PSI validity or write-action assertions
- `IndexNotReadyException`
- editor/document synchronization
- UI refresh or EDT access errors
- fixture/test-data/debugging problems

## Working principles

When solving IntelliJ Platform tasks:

1. Prefer **official platform concepts** over ad-hoc hacks.
2. Put reusable logic in **services**, not in actions.
3. Keep `AnAction.update()` **extremely fast**.
4. Respect **threading and dumb mode** before optimizing behavior.
5. Use **PSI-aware** approaches for structural code tasks.
6. Use **platform UI components** and conventions for user-facing surfaces.
7. Keep plugin dependencies and target IDE scope as small as practical.

## High-value reminders

- `AnAction` implementations should not store request-specific state in fields.
- When targeting IntelliJ Platform 2022.3 or later, actions must implement `getActionUpdateThread()`.
- PSI modifications must run on EDT inside a write action and command; coordinate document changes with the PSI/document APIs used by the platform.
- Not every feature is safe in dumb mode; do not mark things `DumbAware` casually.
- For Kotlin plugins targeting 2024.1+ or newer platform baselines, prefer coroutine-based read/write APIs when appropriate.
- Light services must be `final`; constructor injection of dependency services is unsupported, and services should not be looked up in constructors only to cache them in fields.
- Avoid internal APIs unless there is no viable public alternative and the tradeoff is explicit.

## Typical response strategy

When a user asks for implementation help:

1. Determine the feature surface: action, service, PSI, UI, language support, test, or publishing.
2. Read the matching reference files.
3. Follow the closest official sample or extension-point pattern.
4. Implement the smallest correct solution that matches IntelliJ Platform rules.
5. If publishing or compatibility matters, also review verifier/signing/build-range concerns.
