# LLM Agent Instructions

This file provides comprehensive guidance for AI assistants (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.) working with this security operations repository. It serves as the primary orientation document for understanding the project structure, capabilities, and specialized workflows.

## Project Overview

This is a security operations (SOC) runbook and persona system designed to guide LLM agents through standardized security workflows. The repository contains documentation, procedural guides, and configuration scripts for AI-assisted security operations.

## Repository Structure

- `rules_bank/` - Master source directory containing all documentation, personas, and runbooks
  - `personas/` - Security role definitions (SOC Analysts, Threat Hunters, Incident Responders, etc.)
  - `run_books/` - Step-by-step procedural guides for security tasks
    - `common_steps/` - Reusable procedure components
    - `irps/` - Incident Response Plans for major incidents
    - `guidelines/` - Best practices and documentation guides
- `.claude/` - Claude Code configuration directory
  - `rules_bank/` - Symlink to ../rules_bank (provides access to all content)
- `.clinerules/` - Cline configuration directory
  - `rules_bank/` - Symlink to ../rules_bank (provides access to all content)
- `.gemini/` - Gemini CLI configuration directory
  - `rules_bank/` - Symlink to ../rules_bank (provides access to all content)
- `reports/` - Generated security reports and examples

## Multi-LLM Architecture

This repository is designed for seamless integration across multiple AI assistants through a unified content structure:

### Supported AI Tools
- **Claude Code**: Accesses content through `.claude/rules_bank/` symlinks
- **Cline**: Utilizes `.clinerules/rules_bank/` directory structure  
- **Gemini CLI**: Reads from `.gemini/rules_bank/` configuration
- **Other LLMs**: Can directly access `rules_bank/` master content

### Unified Content Access
All AI tools access identical content through symlinks to the master `rules_bank/` directory. This architecture:
- Ensures consistency across different AI platforms
- Eliminates content duplication and maintenance overhead
- Provides standardized security workflows regardless of the AI assistant used
- Maintains specialized tool configurations while sharing core knowledge

## Configuration Scripts

### Setting Active Persona
```bash
python set_persona_rules.py <persona_name>
# Example: python set_persona_rules.py tier1_soc_analyst
```
Currently supported personas: `tier1_soc_analyst`, `threat_hunter`

### Linking Common Steps
```bash
python symlink_common_steps.py
```
Run this after changing personas to ensure common steps remain accessible.

## Key Concepts & Capabilities

### Core Components
- **Runbooks**: Tactical, step-by-step procedures for specific security tasks (alert triage, IOC enrichment, threat hunting)
- **IRPs**: End-to-end incident response plans for major incidents following PICERL lifecycle  
- **Personas**: Predefined security roles with specific responsibilities, skills, tool access, and specialized slash commands
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol tools for Chronicle SIEM, SOAR, Google Threat Intelligence, and Security Command Center

### Advanced Features
- **Slash Commands**: Specialized commands for security workflows (primarily supported in Claude)
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Persona-based context switching and tool access management
- **Report Generation**: Automated security report creation with standardized templates
- **Threat Intelligence**: Active integration with Google Threat Intelligence and security feeds
- **Multi-Platform SIEM**: Chronicle, SOAR case management, and cloud security integration

## Skills & Persona System

The repository includes a skills-based workflow system with persona-driven orchestration.

### Skills Directory Structure

```
skills/
├── _personas/          # Persona manifest files (YAML)
│   ├── tier1-analyst.yaml
│   ├── tier2-analyst.yaml
│   ├── threat-hunter.yaml
│   └── incident-responder.yaml
├── _workflows/         # Composite/meta-skills
│   ├── full-alert-triage/
│   └── full-investigation/
├── _roles/             # IAM role documentation
│   └── iam-matrix.md
└── <skill-name>/       # Individual atomic skills
    └── SKILL.md
```

### Using Personas

Persona manifests define which skills each security role can use and their typical workflows.

**Available Personas:**

| Persona | Primary Function | Key Skills |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| `tier1-analyst` | Alert triage, initial assessment | triage-alert, enrich-ioc, check-duplicates |
| `tier2-analyst` | Deep investigation, escalated cases | deep-dive-ioc, correlate-ioc, triage-malware |
| `threat-hunter` | Proactive hunting | hunt-apt, hunt-ioc, hunt-threat, hunt-lateral-movement |
| `incident-responder` | PICERL lifecycle management | respond-ransomware, respond-malware, respond-phishing |

**Activating a Persona:**

Each LLM platform activates personas differently:

- **Claude Code**: Uses Task tool with `subagent_type` parameter matching the persona
- **Gemini CLI**: Reference persona file directly: `gemini -p "@skills/_personas/tier1-analyst.yaml Follow this persona workflow..."`
- **Other LLMs**: Read the persona YAML and follow the defined workflows

### Persona Manifest Structure

Each persona YAML defines:

```yaml
name: tier1-analyst
subagent_type: soc-analyst-tier-1  # Maps to Claude Code agent

iam_requirements:
  chronicle:
    roles: [roles/chronicle.viewer]
  soar:
    roles: [roles/chronicle.editor]
  gti:
    license: GTI Standard

skills:
  primary: [triage-alert, enrich-ioc, check-duplicates]
  allowed: [correlate-ioc, generate-report]
  forbidden: [hunt-apt, respond-ransomware]

workflows:
  default_triage:
    chain: [check-duplicates, triage-alert, enrich-ioc, close-or-escalate]
```

### IAM Role Requirements

Skills require specific IAM roles to function. See `skills/_roles/iam-matrix.md` for the complete mapping.

**Key Role Levels by Persona:**

| Persona | Chronicle | SOAR | GTI | Primary Use Case |
|---------|-----------|------|-----|------------------|
| Tier 1 SOC Analyst | viewer | editor | Standard | Alert triage |
| Tier 2 SOC Analyst | editor | editor | Enterprise | Deep investigation |
| Threat Hunter | editor | viewer | Enterprise+ | Proactive hunting |
| Incident Responder | admin | soarAdmin | Enterprise | Incident response |

*Note: This is a simplified view. See `skills/_roles/iam-matrix.md` for complete role mappings including Tier 3 Analyst, SOC Manager, and other personas.*

### Workflow Orchestration

**Atomic Skills**: Single-purpose skills (e.g., `/enrich-ioc`, `/check-duplicates`)

**Meta-Skills/Workflows**: Composite skills that chain atomic skills:
- `/full-alert-triage` - Complete Tier 1 workflow
- `/full-investigation` - Complete Tier 2 workflow

**Skill Chaining Example (Tier 1 Triage):**
```
check-duplicates → triage-alert → enrich-ioc → [close OR escalate]
```

## Working with the Codebase

1. The primary content lives in `rules_bank/` - edit source files there, not in the symlinked directories
2. The symlinks in `.claude/`, `.clinerules/`, and `.gemini/` automatically reflect changes made to `rules_bank/`
3. The project uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for integration with Google Cloud security services
4. Runbook actions map to specific agent tools (see `rules_bank/agent_tool_mapping.md`)

## Essential Context Sources for LLMs

This repository includes multiple layers of context to help AI assistants understand domain-specific security terminology, workflows, and relationships:

### Primary Context Files (Check These First!)
- **`LLMS-THESAURUS.md`** - Controlled vocabulary with security terminology definitions, hierarchical relationships (BT/NT/RT), and scope notes. **CRITICAL for understanding security concepts and terminology consistency.**
- **`LLMS-SITEMAP.md`** - Structural navigation providing directory overviews, content organization maps, priority markers, and cross-references. **ESSENTIAL for understanding content relationships and navigation.**
- **`agent_tool_mapping.md`** - Maps runbook actions to specific MCP tools and security platforms
- **`personas/`** - Role-specific context including responsibilities, skills, tools, and specialized slash commands

**Note on IA File Precedence:** When multiple LLMS-* files exist, prioritize the one closest to your working directory. The rules_bank/LLMS-* files take precedence for security operations, while local directory LLMS-* files provide the most specific context.

### Information Architecture Files (When Present)
- **`CONTENT_AUDIT_[date].md`** - Quality assessments and improvement recommendations
- **`CONTENT_INVENTORY_[date].md`** - Comprehensive catalogs of all content assets
- **`CONTENT_RELATIONSHIPS_[date].md`** - Dependency and relationship analysis between documents
- **`DOCUMENT_CLUSTERING_[date].md`** - Automated topic grouping and similarity analysis  
- **`TAXONOMY_[date].md`** - Hierarchical classification systems for content organization

### Specialized Enhancement Files
- **`reporting_templates.md`** - Standardized formats for security report generation
- **`./reports/`** - Real-world examples of generated security reports and investigations

### Usage Guidelines
**ALWAYS check for these essential files in directories:**
- **LLMS-THESAURUS.md** - For domain vocabulary and terminology consistency
- **LLMS-SITEMAP.md** - For structural navigation and content relationships

These files provide critical context that standard directory listings cannot convey. The specialized terminology and controlled vocabulary from LLMS-THESAURUS.md combined with the structural relationships from LLMS-SITEMAP.md are essential for maintaining consistency and accuracy in security operations.

## Code Style

When writing Python scripts:
- Follow Google Python Style Guide
- Use `pyink` for formatting
- Use `isort` for import sorting
- Line length: 88 characters
- Indentation: 2 or 4 spaces (be consistent within files)

## Report Generation

When executing security runbooks that generate reports (triage, investigations, hunts, etc.):

- **ALWAYS write reports to the `./reports/` directory**
- Use standardized naming convention: `<report_type>_<identifier>_<timestamp>.md`
- Examples:
  - `./reports/alert_triage_report_2194_20250504_1807.md`
  - `./reports/rule_triage_report_ru_99d1f620_20250720_0215.md`
  - `./reports/ioc_enrichment_report_scarfponcho.com_20250503_1856.md`
- Follow the reporting templates in `rules_bank/reporting_templates.md`
- Include proper metadata, findings, and recommendations in all reports

## Available Tools & Integrations

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Tools
The repository integrates with multiple security platforms through MCP tools:

- **`secops-mcp`** - Chronicle SIEM integration (alerts, events, rules, threat intelligence)
- **`secops-soar`** - SOAR platform integration (case management, alerts, entities, workflows)
- **`gti`** - Google Threat Intelligence (threat analysis, IOC enrichment, malware research)
- **`scc-mcp`** - Security Command Center (cloud security posture, vulnerability management)

## Important Notes & Best Practices

### Repository Guidelines
- This is primarily a documentation repository - no build, test, or lint commands exist
- **Always edit source files in `rules_bank/`** - not through symlinked directories
- Changes to `rules_bank/` automatically propagate to all AI tool configurations
- The symlink system ensures unified access across different AI platforms

### Security Operations Focus
- Specialized for defensive security operations and incident response
- Integrates with enterprise security platforms (Chronicle, SOAR, GTI, SCC)
- Follows industry-standard frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK, NIST, SANS)
- Designed for real-world SOC analyst and security engineer workflows

### Context Optimization
- **Read LLMS-THESAURUS.md files first** for domain vocabulary understanding
- Check persona files for role-specific context and available tools
- Reference agent_tool_mapping.md for MCP tool capabilities
- Use reporting templates for consistent output formatting
