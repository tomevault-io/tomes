# Suspicious Login Triage Skill

Guide initial triage of suspicious login alerts (impossible travel, untrusted location, multiple failed logins) for Tier 1 SOC Analysts.

## Inputs

- `CASE_ID` - SOAR case ID containing the alert(s)
- `ALERT_GROUP_IDENTIFIERS` - Alert group identifiers from the case
- *(Optional)* `USER_ID` - The user ID if known upfront
- *(Optional)* `SOURCE_IP` - The source IP if known upfront

## Workflow

### Step 1: Get Case Context

```
secops-soar.get_case_full_details(case_id=CASE_ID)
```

### Step 2: Extract Key Entities

```
secops-soar.list_events_by_alert(case_id=CASE_ID, alert_id=ALERT_ID)
```

Parse events to extract:
- `USER_ID` - The user account
- `SOURCE_IP` - The login source IP
- `HOSTNAME` - The target/source hostname (if available)

### Step 3: User Context (SIEM)

```
secops-mcp.lookup_entity(entity_value=USER_ID)
```

Record: Recent activity, first/last seen, related alerts.

### Step 4: Source IP Enrichment

Use `/enrich-ioc` with IOC_TYPE="IP Address":
- GTI reputation and geolocation
- SIEM entity summary
- IOC match status

### Step 5: Hostname Context (if available)

```
secops-mcp.lookup_entity(entity_value=HOSTNAME)
```

### Step 6: Recent Login Activity

Search for login patterns over the last 96 hours:

```
secops-mcp.search_security_events(
    text='metadata.event_type IN ("USER_LOGIN", "AUTH_ATTEMPT") AND principal.user.userid = "USER_ID"',
    hours_back=96
)
```

Analyze for:
- Logins from unusual IPs
- Successful logins after failures
- Geographic anomalies (impossible travel)
- Concurrent sessions from different locations

### Step 7: Check Related Cases

Use `/find-relevant-case` with search terms: `[USER_ID, SOURCE_IP, HOSTNAME]`

### Step 8: (Optional) Identity Provider Check

If IDP tools available (e.g., Okta):
- Account status
- MFA enrollment
- Recent legitimate logins
- Password change history

### Step 9: Synthesize & Document

Use `/document-in-case` with findings summary:

```
Suspicious Login Triage for USER_ID from SOURCE_IP:
- User SIEM Summary: [...]
- Source IP GTI: [reputation, geo]
- Login Pattern: [normal/anomalous]
- Related Cases: [...]
- Recommendation: [Close as FP | Escalate to Tier 2]
```

## Required Outputs

**After completing this skill, you MUST report these outputs:**

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `LOGIN_VERDICT` | Assessment: `legitimate`, `suspicious`, or `malicious` |
| `ANOMALY_INDICATORS` | What made the login suspicious (impossible travel, new device, etc.) |
| `RELATED_ACTIVITY` | Other suspicious activity from user or source IP |
| `RISK_SCORE` | Numerical risk assessment (0-100) based on findings |

## Decision Matrix

| Finding | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Known VPN/corporate IP + normal pattern | Close as FP |
| User confirmed travel + MFA used | Close as Benign TP |
| Malicious IP reputation | Escalate |
| Impossible travel + no MFA | Escalate urgently |
| Multiple failures then success from new IP | Escalate |
| Pattern matches user's normal behavior | Close as FP |

## Key Patterns to Detect

**Impossible Travel:**
- Login from NYC, then London 30 mins later
- Check if VPN or cloud service could explain

**Credential Stuffing:**
- Many failures across multiple accounts from same IP
- Success after many failures

**Account Takeover:**
- Login from new device/location
- Followed by password change or MFA modification

**Lateral Movement:**
- Same user logging into many systems rapidly
- Unusual service account activity
