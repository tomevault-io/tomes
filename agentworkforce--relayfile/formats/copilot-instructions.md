# Trail

Record your work as a trajectory for future agents and humans to follow.

For this repository, use `npm run trail -- ...` for trajectory commands. The
wrapper pins `TRAJECTORIES_PROJECT` to `AgentWorkforce/relayfile` so artifacts
do not record local workstation paths.

## Usage

If `trail` is installed globally, run commands directly:
```bash
trail start "Task description"
```

If not globally installed, use npx to run from local installation:
```bash
npx trail start "Task description"
```

## When Starting Work

Start a trajectory when beginning a task:

```bash
trail start "Implement user authentication"
```

With external task reference:
```bash
trail start "Fix login bug" --task "ENG-123"
```

## Recording Decisions

Record key decisions as you work:

```bash
trail decision "Chose JWT over sessions" \
  --reasoning "Stateless scaling requirements"
```

For minor decisions, reasoning is optional:
```bash
trail decision "Used existing auth middleware"
```

**Record decisions when you:**
- Choose between alternatives
- Make architectural trade-offs
- Decide on an approach after investigation

## Recording Reflections

Periodically step back and synthesize progress:

```bash
trail reflect "Workers aligned on auth approach, API layer progressing well" \
  --confidence 0.8
```

With focal points and adjustments:
```bash
trail reflect "Frontend and backend duplicating validation logic" \
  --focal-points "duplication,ownership" \
  --adjustments "Reassigning validation to backend team" \
  --confidence 0.7
```

**Record reflections when you:**
- Have received several updates and need to synthesize the big picture
- Notice workers or tasks diverging from the plan
- Want to course-correct before continuing
- Are coordinating multiple agents and need to assess overall progress

Reflections differ from decisions: decisions record a specific choice,
reflections record a higher-level synthesis of what's happening and whether
the current approach is working.

## Completing Work

When done, complete with a retrospective:

```bash
trail complete --summary "Added JWT auth with refresh tokens" --confidence 0.85
```

After completing work, compact the finished trajectory or merged PR into a
durable summary. When the compacted summary is sufficient, discard the raw
source trajectories so `.trajectories/index.json` and list output stay focused:

```bash
trail compact --discard-sources
# or after a PR merge:
trail compact --pr 42 --discard-sources
```

`--discard-sources` removes the source trajectory JSON/Markdown/trace files and
updates the index. Use it after confirming the compacted artifact is the record
you want to keep.

**Confidence levels:**
- 0.9+ : High confidence, well-tested
- 0.7-0.9 : Good confidence, standard implementation
- 0.5-0.7 : Some uncertainty, edge cases possible
- <0.5 : Significant uncertainty, needs review

## Abandoning Work

If you need to stop without completing:

```bash
trail abandon --reason "Blocked by missing API credentials"
```

## Checking Status

View current trajectory:
```bash
trail status
```

## Listing and Viewing Trajectories

List all trajectories:
```bash
trail list
```

View a specific trajectory:
```bash
trail show <trajectory-id>
```

Export a trajectory (markdown, json, timeline, html):
```bash
trail export <trajectory-id> --format markdown
```

## Compacting Trajectories

After a PR merge, compact related trajectories into a single summary and prune
raw source trajectories when the summary should replace them:

```bash
trail compact --pr 42 --discard-sources
```

Compact by branch (finds trajectories with commits not in the specified base branch):
```bash
trail compact --branch main --discard-sources
```

Compact by specific commits:
```bash
trail compact --commits abc123,def456 --discard-sources
```

Compaction consolidates decisions and creates a grouped summary. Adding
`--discard-sources` makes the compacted artifact the durable record by removing
the raw trajectories and their index entries.

## Why Trail?

Your trajectory helps others understand:
- **What** you built (commits show this)
- **Why** you built it this way (trajectory shows this)
- **What alternatives** you considered
- **What challenges** you faced

Future agents can query past trajectories to learn from your decisions.

# OpenAPI Spec

`openapi/relayfile-v1.openapi.yaml` is the authoritative HTTP contract for this service.

Keep it in sync with `internal/httpapi/server.go` at all times:

- Adding a handler → add the path entry to the spec.
- Adding a query parameter → add it to the endpoint or to `components/parameters`.
- Adding a request/response field → update `components/schemas`.
- Adding a new status code → add it to the endpoint's `responses` map.

After server changes, run `scripts/check-contract-surface.sh` to check for drift.

# Digest Runtime Contract

Relayfile runtime changes that write provider records must keep
`/digests/today.md` and `/digests/yesterday.md` current.

- Any new ingest, sync, bulk-write, or provider mutation path must emit
  filesystem events and trigger digest regeneration for non-digest paths.
- Digest regeneration must not recurse on `/digests/*` writes, but digest file
  updates must still emit normal file events so mounted workspaces receive the
  changed digest files.
- Preserve terminal provider state as data. Do not represent `closed`,
  `merged`, `archived`, `completed`, `canceled`, or `resolved` as a file delete
  unless the upstream object was actually deleted.
- Add tests for both the event path and the digest artifact path when changing
  ingest behavior.

Full rule: `.claude/rules/relayfile-integration-digests.md`.
