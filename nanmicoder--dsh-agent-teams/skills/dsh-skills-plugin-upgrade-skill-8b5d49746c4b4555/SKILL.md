# plugin-upgrade

Safely handle three task types: read-only update inspection, installed-plugin upgrades, and DSH host version compatibility migration. If user intent is unclear, confirm the mode first; never let "help me check for updates" slide into installing or changing code.

Note: the version cards and reference docs under `references/` are in English; card IDs and cited commands are language-neutral.

## Step 0: choose a mode

| Mode | User intent | Default allowed action |
|---|---|---|
| A · inspect | Check for updates or assess impact from a DSH release | Read-only investigation and report; then stop |
| B · update | Upgrade an installed plugin to an explicit version | Plan and confirm before changing composition or dependencies |
| C · author-migrate | Upgrade a plugin author's source repository for a newer DSH host | Baseline, build the version corridor and touchpoint inventory, then implement the approved migration |

This skill does not handle "upgrade DSH core only and leave the plugins alone," and it must not modify DSH core to conceal plugin incompatibility.

## Global DSH host upgrades (agent discipline)

Upgrading the dsh host itself (`npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh@…`) is not Mode B/C plugin
work — and when the requesting agent runs INSIDE a dsh session it is structurally fatal:
the session IS the host process, npm removes/replaces the very package tree it executes
from, the host dies mid-install (the tool call never returns), and the interrupted install
leaves package content present WITHOUT regenerated shims — the `dsh` command itself is
gone until an external pinned re-install repairs it. Never execute the global host
upgrade from inside a session on that host; hand the user the external procedure:

1. fully stop every dsh process (a running host holds native-module file locks → EBUSY;
   a browser refresh is not a host stop);
2. from an EXTERNAL terminal, run the pinned install
   `npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh@<exact-version>` (a bare package name resolves to the
   `latest` dist-tag and can silently downgrade to an older line);
3. restart `dsh web`, hard-refresh the browser, verify version markers and plugins.

Because the host is fully stopped before npm runs, nothing crashes mid-install — a crash
during the upgrade is a signature of doing it wrong, not a risk to tolerate. If an install
was already interrupted: repair from an external shell by re-running the pinned formal
install (never hand-copy package directories or hand-write shims).

## Shared read-only preparation

1. Read the target repository's rules such as `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`; check branch, HEAD, working tree, and submodules. Stop and report unfamiliar changes or untracked files; never auto-stash, reset, clean, or checkout.
2. Record source identity and installation identity separately: registry package, Git checkout, workspace/junction, or copied install; record the source repository/URL, Git SHA, actual package name, the plugin's own version, the declared/resolved DSH dependency cohort, and current DSH/Node versions. A plugin release version (for example `0.6.4 → 0.7.0-alpha.0`) is not the DSH host corridor (`0.1.0-rc.6 → 0.1.2-alpha.4`). GitHub owner/repo and registry scope/package are independent coordinates — do not derive or rewrite one from the other.
3. Preserve file ownership boundaries:
   - `package.json` / lockfile: package and dependencies;
   - `dsh-plugin.json`: community-standard manifest (if adopted);
   - `cordis.patch.yml` / `agent.cordis.yml` / legacy `cordis.yml`: profile composition;
   - resolved config: runtime composition result, used for verification only; never write the whole object back.
4. Verify the target version's source, tag/package name, compatibility range, release notes, install scripts, and known breaking changes. Never read, print, or commit tokens, `.npmrc` contents, credentials, or session logs.
5. Record the rollback baseline: current HEAD/package version, lockfile, and hashes/paths for configuration that may change. Describe recovery only for the explicit paths owned by this task; do not promise rollback of arbitrary third-party script side effects.

## Mode A · inspect (read-only)

Report: current/available versions, source, compatibility range, breaking changes, recommended target, risks, and a validation plan. Do not edit files, install dependencies, run lifecycle scripts, `git pull`, or switch versions. If the user decides to proceed, enter Mode B or C with separate confirmation.

## Mode B · update (upgrade an installed plugin)

1. Choose the single update mechanism that matches the resolved package identity and installation track; when a lockfile exists, use only its package manager — do not mix npm/pnpm/bun, and do not rewrite a registry package name to match a GitHub owner.
2. Produce a change plan: exact target version, commands to run, files that will change, lifecycle scripts that may run, configuration migration, and rollback steps.
3. Obtain explicit user confirmation before any write or install, even when no breaking change is known.
4. Make minimal changes in a dedicated branch/worktree; patch configuration by path and preserve unknown fields. For Git sources, fetch and compare an explicit tag or commit first; never `git pull` a dirty worktree.
5. Successful dependency installation does not mean DSH has enabled the plugin; verify the target profile's composition actually resolves to the target package, remove old source lines owned by this upgrade if any exist, and confirm the runtime entry is active.
6. Run "Validation and reporting"; on failure, restore only the paths owned by this task and report residual side effects.

## Mode C · author-migrate (migrate a plugin source repository with a DSH upgrade)

0. Run the baseline first: in the repository's own dependency state (no target pin, no target env) run the mechanical suite (build / typecheck / tests; these run package scripts, so first show the commands to be executed per the safety boundaries and obtain confirmation), and record pre-existing failures as an exemption list (see R-06 in [references/rollup-0.1.2.md](references/rollup-0.1.2.md); later corridors follow the same pattern). The migration must not add or worsen failures; pre-existing failures are exempted per the baseline.
1. Confirm exact from/to tags; connect version corridors by the `from → to` metadata in [references/README.md](references/README.md) — never by filename lexicographic order. If the source is older than the earliest card, mark that segment as an unsupported gap and derive it from exact-tag source, packed declarations, and reproducible tests; do not pretend a later card covers it.
2. Read the full corridor first and compute the final net state. When a field is removed in an intermediate version and restored in the target, do not delete and re-add it.
3. Scan the seven touchpoint classes per [pre-flight.md](references/pre-flight.md): source patches, events, services/Remote, host filesystem, UI/commands/tools, custom channels, subprocess/output. You may first run the read-only [migration planner](scripts/README.md) to generate paths/line numbers and candidate cards, but its results remain heuristic; zero hits still require checking dependencies/imports and running build plus a real mount.
4. Keep only cards that intersect the hit touchpoints and the actual face (Host / Web Client / ordinary plugin). Cards are a curated list, not a complete API diff; when corridor edges or API coordinates are missing, mark them unsupported/pending instead of changing things from memory.
5. Produce a source-migration plan grouped by Host/Web Client seam, listing hit files, cards, target behavior, and tests; obtain confirmation before implementing in a dedicated branch/worktree. Keep the DSH cohort exact and coherent in `package.json` and the lockfile; a successful install with mixed old/new peers is not a migration. If a selector or callback unexpectedly becomes `any`, run one diagnostic typecheck with `skipLibCheck: false` and declare the packages that own the consumed declarations directly. `capability` cards are suggestions only — never adopt them automatically.
6. After compatibility changes pass, choose and apply the plugin's own SemVer bump separately. Verify the packed filename and packed manifest both carry that plugin version; never use the DSH host version as the plugin release version by accident. For the removed `dsh-client-runtime`, keyed chat snapshots, command execution signature, or Workspace navigation (`connectWorkspace` / `pickDirectory`), use [the alpha.2 API ledger](references/api-migration-0.1.2-alpha.2.md) and [DSH-0.1.2-A1-32](references/v0.1.2-alpha.1.md).

## Safety boundaries

- Show the plan and obtain confirmation before any file write, install, version fetch/switch, or package script run;
- Never auto-stash/reset/clean/force-update, and never overwrite user or other agents' work;
- Never expose credentials; diagnostics may report only whether something is configured and non-sensitive versions/sources;
- Do not retry unknown `gateway/internal` or other failures by default; retry only when the error is retryable, the operation is idempotent, and policy allows;
- When a migration approach cannot be determined with high confidence from primary sources or reproducible behavior, stop automatic changes and mark it "pending review";
- When local observation conflicts with a primary source, record both, reproduce, and report — do not silently pick one side.

## Validation and reporting

Validate at least the applicable layers:

1. Dependency resolution: the package manager, lockfile, and dependency graph change only as expected; scan the full lockfile for the old DSH cohort and removed packages, not only top-level dependencies;
2. Enablement resolution: the target profile's composition points to the expected package identity, with no old source or duplicate rows;
3. Static: build, typecheck, and plugin tests; for the alpha.2 corridor, close out [references/precision-checklist.md](references/precision-checklist.md), keeping type declarations separate from runtime module/service activation and preserving existing channel protocols when applying the Connection auth gate;
4. Runtime: cold-start a real DSH profile; verify entry activation and that required/provided Cordis services do not remain pending — [verify-runtime.mjs](scripts/verify-runtime.mjs) runs this layer end-to-end in an isolated profile and reports failure attribution (plugin-code / dependency-resolution / profile-config / dsh-runtime). For a Web Client plugin, exchange the printed token URL for its cookie, read the host boot manifest, request the advertised client artifact, and prove registration/mount rather than accepting a bare HTTP 200;
5. Behavior: execute one core plugin path; host migrations must complete at least one message → tool → response flow, or an equivalent dedicated flow;
6. Wrapper: verify exit code, stdout, stderr, cancellation, and teardown.

Structure the report as:

- pre-existing (Mode C with the baseline run; other modes note "not collected"): the list of failures from the baseline (untouched, not attributed to this migration);
- **Completed**: versions, files, cards, and validation;
- **Skipped**: non-hits or inapplicable items with evidence;
- **Pending/residual risk**: missing sources, untested platforms, lifecycle-script side effects;
- **Rollback**: recorded baseline and recoverable paths;
- **Recommendations**: optional capabilities and follow-up work migrating to public seams.
