Project-specific guidance for Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Project Overview

Sindri is a complete AI-powered cloud development forge running on Fly.io infrastructure. It provides cost-optimized,
secure virtual machines with persistent storage for AI-assisted development without requiring local installation.
Like the legendary Norse blacksmith, Sindri forges powerful development environments from cloud infrastructure,
AI tools, and developer workflows.

## Development Commands

### VM Management

```bash
./scripts/vm-setup.sh --app-name <name>  # Deploy new VM
./scripts/vm-suspend.sh                  # Suspend to save costs
./scripts/vm-resume.sh                   # Resume VM
./scripts/vm-teardown.sh                 # Remove VM and volumes
flyctl status -a <app-name>             # Check VM status

# CI/Testing deployment (disables SSH daemon, health checks)
CI_MODE=true ./scripts/vm-setup.sh --app-name <test-name>
flyctl deploy --strategy immediate --wait-timeout 60s  # Skip health checks
```

### On-VM Commands

```bash
extension-manager list                            # List available extensions
extension-manager --interactive                   # Interactive extension setup
extension-manager install <name>                  # Install specific extension
extension-manager install-all                     # Install all active extensions
claude                                            # Authenticate Claude Code
npx claude-flow@alpha init --force               # Initialize Claude Flow in project
new-project <name> [--type <type>]               # Create new project with enhancements
clone-project <url> [options]                    # Clone and enhance repository
```

## Key Directories

### User Workspace (developer-owned, writable)

- `/workspace/developer/` - Developer home directory (persistent)
- `/workspace/scripts/` - User scripts and extension-generated helpers
- `/workspace/projects/active/` - Active development projects
- `/workspace/config/` - User configuration files
- `/workspace/bin/` - User binaries (in PATH)
- `/workspace/docs/` - Workspace-wide documentation

### System Directories (managed by Sindri)

- `/docker/lib/` - System libraries and extension definitions (immutable, from Docker image)
- `/docker/lib/extensions.d/` - Extension definitions and templates
- `/workspace/.system/` - System runtime files (do not modify directly)
  - `bin/` - System binaries (symlinked to /docker)
  - `lib/` - System libraries (symlinked to /docker)
  - `manifest/` - Extension activation configuration

All user data in `/workspace` persists between VM restarts. System files in `/docker` are immutable
and updated only via Docker image rebuilds. The `.system/` directory uses symlinks for efficiency.

## Development Workflow

### Daily Tasks

1. Connect via SSH: `ssh developer@<app-name>.fly.dev -p 10022`
   - Alternative: `flyctl ssh console -a <app-name>` (uses Fly.io's hallpass service)
2. Work in `/workspace/` (all data persists)
3. VM auto-suspends when idle
4. VM auto-resumes on next connection

### Project Creation

```bash
# New project
new-project my-app --type node

# Clone existing
clone-project https://github.com/user/repo --feature my-feature

# Both automatically:
# - Create CLAUDE.md context
# - Initialize Claude Flow
# - Install dependencies
```

## Extension System (v1.0)

Sindri uses a manifest-based extension system to manage development tools and environments.

### Extension Management

```bash
# List all available extensions
extension-manager list

# Interactive setup with prompts (recommended for first-time setup)
extension-manager --interactive

# Install an extension (auto-activates if needed)
extension-manager install <name>

# Install all active extensions from manifest
extension-manager install-all

# Check extension status
extension-manager status <name>

# Validate extension installation
extension-manager validate <name>

# Validate all installed extensions
extension-manager validate-all

# Uninstall extension
extension-manager uninstall <name>

# Reorder extension priority
extension-manager reorder <name> <position>

# Upgrade commands (Extension API v2.0)
extension-manager upgrade <name>         # Upgrade specific extension
extension-manager upgrade-all            # Upgrade all extensions
extension-manager upgrade-all --dry-run  # Preview upgrades
extension-manager check-updates          # Check for updates
extension-manager upgrade-history        # View upgrade history
```

### Automatic Dependency Resolution (Extension API v2.2)

Extensions automatically install their dependencies without manual intervention:

```bash
# Example: Install openskills (requires nodejs + git)
extension-manager install openskills
# → Auto-installs nodejs first
# → Auto-installs git
# → Installs openskills

# Show dependency tree without installing
extension-manager resolve playwright
# Output: nodejs, playwright
```

**Dependency Graph:**

- `openskills` → nodejs, git
- `monitoring` → python
- `playwright` → nodejs
- `nodejs-devtools` → nodejs

**How It Works:**

1. System detects `EXT_DEPENDENCIES` metadata from extension files
2. Builds dependency graph with cycle detection
3. Performs topological sort to determine install order
4. Adds all dependencies to manifest in correct order
5. Installs dependencies first, then target extension

**Benefits:**

- No manual dependency management required
- Prevents "missing prerequisite" errors
- Ensures correct installation order
- Automatically updates manifest

### Activation Manifest

Extensions are defined in the Docker image at `/docker/lib/extensions.d/`. Your active extensions are
configured in `/workspace/.system/manifest/active-extensions.conf`, which is initialized from
`docker/lib/extensions.d/active-extensions.conf.example` (development) or `active-extensions.ci.conf` (CI mode).

Example manifest:

```bash
# Base system (pre-installed in Docker image, always available):
# - Workspace structure (/workspace directories)
# - mise (tool version manager)
# - SSH environment (non-interactive session support)
# - Claude Code CLI

# Foundational languages
nodejs
python

# Additional language runtimes
golang
rust

# Infrastructure tools
docker
infra-tools
```

### Extension API

Each extension implements 6 standard functions (API v1.0) or 7 functions (API v2.0):

- `prerequisites()` - Check system requirements
- `install()` - Install packages and tools
- `configure()` - Post-install configuration
- `validate()` - Run smoke tests
- `status()` - Check installation state
- `remove()` - Uninstall and cleanup
- `upgrade()` - Upgrade installed tools (API v2.0+)

#### DNS Checks (API v2.1+)

Extensions can declare required domains via the `EXT_REQUIRED_DOMAINS` metadata field:

```bash
EXT_REQUIRED_DOMAINS="example.com github.com registry.npmjs.org"
```

These domains are:

- Automatically checked in `prerequisites()` via `check_required_domains()` helper
- Aggregated and checked once upfront during `extension-manager install-all`
- Used to provide clear DNS error messages before installation attempts

Extensions without external domain dependencies can simply omit this field

## mise Tool Manager

Sindri uses **mise** (https://mise.jdx.dev) for unified tool version management across multiple languages and runtimes.
mise provides a single, consistent interface for managing Node.js, Python, Rust, Go, Ruby, and their associated tools,
replacing multiple version managers (NVM, pyenv, rbenv, rustup, etc.) with one tool.

**Note:** mise is pre-installed in the Docker image and is always available.
It does not need to be installed manually.

### mise-Managed Extensions

The following extensions use mise for tool installation and version management (mise is pre-installed):

- **nodejs**: Node.js LTS via mise (replaces NVM)
  - Manages Node.js versions
  - npm package manager
  - Per-project version configuration

- **python**: Python 3.13 + pipx tools via mise
  - Python runtime versions
  - pipx-installed tools (uv, black, ruff, etc.)
  - Virtual environment support

- **rust**: Rust stable + cargo tools via mise
  - Rust toolchain versions
  - Cargo package manager
  - Development tools (clippy, rustfmt)

- **golang**: Go 1.24 + go tools via mise
  - Go language versions
  - Go toolchain utilities
  - Development tools (gopls, delve, golangci-lint)

- **ruby**: Ruby 3.4.7 + Rails + gems via mise
  - Ruby runtime versions
  - gem and bundle package managers
  - Rails framework (development mode only)
  - Development gems (rubocop, rspec, pry, etc.)

- **nodejs-devtools**: npm global tools via mise
  - TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier
  - nodemon, goalie
  - Managed via mise npm plugin

### Common mise Commands

```bash
# List all installed tools and versions
mise ls

# List versions of a specific tool
mise ls node
mise ls python
mise ls rust
mise ls go
mise ls ruby

# Install or switch tool versions
mise use node@20          # Switch to Node.js 20
mise use python@3.11      # Switch to Python 3.11
mise use rust@stable      # Switch to stable Rust
mise use go@1.24          # Switch to Go 1.24
mise use ruby@3.4.7       # Switch to Ruby 3.4.7

# Update all tools to latest versions
mise upgrade

# Check for configuration issues
mise doctor

# View current environment
mise env

# Install tools from mise.toml
mise install

# Uninstall a tool version
mise uninstall node@18
```

### Per-Project Tool Versions

Create a `mise.toml` file in your project root to specify tool versions:

```toml
[tools]
node = "20"
python = "3.11"
rust = "1.75"
go = "1.24"

[env]
NODE_ENV = "development"
```

mise automatically switches to the specified versions when you enter the directory:

```bash
# Create project with specific versions
cd /workspace/projects/active/my-project
cat > mise.toml << 'EOF'
[tools]
node = "20"
python = "3.11"

[env]
NODE_ENV = "production"
EOF

# mise automatically detects and switches versions
node --version    # v20.x.x
python --version  # Python 3.11.x
```

### Benefits of mise

- **Unified Interface**: One tool for all language runtimes
- **Automatic Switching**: Changes versions based on directory
- **Fast**: Written in Rust, faster than shell-based managers
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Per-Project Config**: Each project defines its own versions
- **Global Fallback**: Global versions used when no project config exists
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Supports 100+ tools via plugins
- **Backwards Compatible**: Works with .nvmrc, .python-version, etc.

## Testing and Validation

No specific test framework enforced - check each project's README for:

- Test commands (npm test, pytest, go test, etc.)
- Linting requirements
- Build processes

Always run project-specific linting/formatting before commits.

## CI/CD & GitHub Actions

Sindri uses a unified GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing with a sequential, fail-fast testing strategy.

### Unified Integration Testing Architecture

**Single Entry Point**: All CI/CD testing flows through `integration.yml`, which
orchestrates 6 sequential phases with controlled concurrency (max 3 jobs).

**Sequential Execution Flow**:

```text
quick-checks (inline, fail-fast ✗)
    ↓
manifest-validation (static, fail-fast ✗)
    ↓
dependency-chain (3 VMs, fail-fast ✗)
    ↓
infrastructure (1 VM, fail-fast ✗)
    ↓
individual-extensions (N VMs, 3 max concurrent, fail-after-all-complete ⚠)
    ↓
extension-combinations (N VMs, 3 max concurrent, fail-after-all-complete ⚠)
```

**Legend**:

- ✗ = Fail immediately, stop entire workflow
- ⚠ = Let all running jobs complete, then fail workflow

### Testing Phases

#### Phase 1: Quick Checks (2-5 minutes, inline)

- Shellcheck validation for all shell scripts
- YAML syntax validation for workflows and actions
- Extension manager syntax check
- Fails immediately on any validation error

#### Phase 2: Manifest Validation (2 minutes, no VM)

- Static validation of extension syntax
- Static dependency chain verification (files exist)
- Manifest template validation
- Extension metadata validation
- Fails immediately if validation errors found

#### Phase 2.5: Dependency Chain Tests (3-5 minutes, max 3 VMs)

- Runtime testing of automatic dependency resolution
- Tests: nodejs-devtools→nodejs, openskills→nodejs+git, playwright→nodejs
- Verifies extension manager automatically installs dependencies
- Fails immediately if dependency resolution broken

#### Phase 3: Infrastructure Tests (5-7 minutes, 1 VM)

- VM deployment and configuration (minimal tier: 1GB/1CPU)
- SSH connectivity verification
- Volume mount and persistence testing
- Auto-suspend functionality
- Secrets management (SOPS + age)
- Basic developer workflow validation
- Fails immediately if infrastructure issues found

#### Phase 4: Individual Extensions (15-20 minutes, N VMs, 3 max concurrent)

- Matrix of all 20+ extensions
- Each extension runs complete test suite:
  - Installation with dependencies
  - Validation
  - API compliance (validate, status functions)
  - Key functionality testing
  - Idempotency verification
  - Upgrade functionality (API v2.0+)
- Tier-based resources (minimal/standard/heavy/xheavy)
- **Fail behavior**: Let all running jobs complete before failing

#### Phase 5: Extension Combinations (10-12 minutes, N VMs, 3 max concurrent)

- Multi-extension scenario testing
- Common stacks: mise-stack, full-node, fullstack, systems, enterprise, ai-dev
- Performance tier resources (16GB/4CPU)
- **Fail behavior**: Let all running jobs complete before failing

### Main Workflow

**Integration Tests (`integration.yml`)**

- Single entry point for all CI/CD testing
- Runs on: push to main/develop, pull requests, weekly schedule (Saturday 2:00 AM UTC)
- Orchestrates 5 sequential phases with controlled concurrency
- Provides comprehensive test summary at the end
- Location: `.github/workflows/integration.yml`

### Reusable workflow_call Workflows

**Manifest Validation (`manifest-validation.yml`)**

- Called by integration.yml after quick-checks
- Location: `.github/workflows/manifest-validation.yml`

**Dependency Chain Tests (`dependency-chain-tests.yml`)**

- Runtime testing of automatic dependency resolution
- Tests 3 representative dependency chains with max 3 concurrent VMs
- Verifies extension manager auto-installs dependencies
- Called by integration.yml after manifest-validation
- Location: `.github/workflows/dependency-chain-tests.yml`

**Infrastructure Tests (`infrastructure-tests.yml`)**

- Single VM for infrastructure validation
- Consolidates: VM deployment, SSH, volumes, persistence, secrets, mise-stack
- Called by integration.yml after manifest-validation
- Location: `.github/workflows/infrastructure-tests.yml`

**Per-Extension Tests (`per-extension-tests.yml`)**

- Matrix of all extensions with complete test suite
- Max 3 concurrent extension tests
- Called by integration.yml after infrastructure tests
- Location: `.github/workflows/per-extension-tests.yml`

**Extension Combinations (`extension-combinations.yml`)**

- Builds and pushes Docker images to Fly.io registry
- Automatic triggers on Dockerfile/docker/\* changes
- Tags: PR-specific, branch-specific, and latest
- Enables ~75% faster CI/CD by reusing images
- Location: `.github/workflows/build-image.yml`

### Concurrency Control

**Maximum 3 Jobs Concurrent**:

- Quick checks, manifest validation, infrastructure: Run sequentially (1 job at a time)
- Individual extensions: Max 3 extensions tested concurrently
- Extension combinations: Max 3 combinations tested concurrently
- **Result**: Controlled resource usage, predictable cost

**Fail-Fast Behavior**:

- Early phases (quick-checks, manifest-validation, infrastructure): Stop immediately on failure
- Extension phases (individual-extensions, extension-combinations): Let all running jobs
  complete before failing
- **Benefit**: Save CI time on early failures, get complete results for extension testing

### Weekly Scheduled Testing

The unified integration workflow runs weekly on Saturday at 2:00 AM UTC, ensuring regular
quality gates without slowing down daily development.

### Pre-Built Docker Images

Sindri uses pre-built Docker images to dramatically improve CI/CD performance:

**Setup (First-Time Only)**:

```bash
# Create registry app (one-time setup)
flyctl apps create sindri-registry --org personal
```

**How It Works**:

- Images are built once and reused across all test jobs
- Automatic rebuilding when Dockerfile or docker/\* files change
- Conditional reuse when no Docker changes detected
- ~75% reduction in workflow execution time

**Image Tags**:

- Pull Requests: `registry.fly.io/sindri-registry:pr-<number>-<sha>`
- Branch Builds: `registry.fly.io/sindri-registry:<branch>-<sha>`
- Latest (main): `registry.fly.io/sindri-registry:latest`

**Performance Impact**:

- Integration Tests: 15min → 4min (**73% faster**)
- Extension Tests: 45min → 12min (**73% faster**)
- Per-Extension Tests: 6min → 1.5min (**75% faster**)

## Agent Configuration

Agents extend Claude's capabilities for specialized tasks. Configuration:

- `/workspace/config/agents-config.yaml` - Agent sources and settings
- `/workspace/.agent-aliases` - Shell aliases for agent commands

Common agent commands:

```bash
agent-manager update       # Update all agents
agent-search "keyword"     # Search available agents
agent-install <name>       # Install specific agent
cf-with-context <agent>    # Run agent with project context
```

## Memory and Context Management

### Project Context

Each project should have its own CLAUDE.md file:

```bash
# Create project-specific CLAUDE.md
cat > CLAUDE.md << 'EOF'
# [PROJECT_NAME]

## Project Overview
[Brief description of the project]

## Development Commands
[Add common commands here]

## Architecture Notes
[Add architectural decisions and patterns]

## Important Files
[List key files and their purposes]
EOF
```

### Claude Flow Memory

- Persistent memory in `.swarm/memory.db`
- Multi-agent coordination and context retention
- Memory survives VM restarts via persistent volume

### Global Preferences

Store user preferences in `/workspace/developer/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

- Coding style preferences
- Git workflow preferences
- Testing preferences

## Secrets Management

Sindri uses automatic, transparent secrets management with SOPS + age encryption. Secrets are encrypted at rest
and never exposed in environment variables or process lists.

### Adding Secrets

Secrets are automatically synced from Fly.io secrets to an encrypted file on every VM boot:

```bash
# On host machine - set secrets via Fly.io
flyctl secrets set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... -a myapp
flyctl secrets set GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_... -a myapp
flyctl secrets set PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-... -a myapp

# VM restarts automatically
# Secrets are encrypted and tools are pre-authenticated
```

**Supported Secrets:**

**AI/Development Tools:**

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Claude Code authentication
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - GitHub CLI authentication
- `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` - Goalie research assistant
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - OpenRouter API access
- `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` - Gemini CLI
- `XAI_API_KEY` - xAI Grok SDK

**Cloud Provider Credentials:**

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` - AWS CLI
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID` - Azure CLI

### Using Tools with Secrets

```bash
# SSH to VM
ssh developer@myapp.fly.dev -p 10022

# Everything just works - secrets already configured
claude              # Already authenticated
gh pr create        # Already authenticated
goalie "research"   # API key pre-configured
```

### Advanced: Direct Secret Management

Secrets management commands are installed as standalone scripts in `/workspace/bin`, making them
available in both interactive and non-interactive shells (CI/CD):

```bash
# View decrypted secrets
view-secrets

# Edit secrets without VM restart
edit-secrets

# Load secrets into current shell (must be sourced)
source load-secrets

# Run command with secrets loaded
with-secrets some-command
```

**Note:** `load-secrets` must be sourced (not executed directly) to load secrets into your current
shell environment. Use `source load-secrets` or `. load-secrets`.

### Security Features

- **Encrypted at rest**: Secrets stored in `~/.secrets/secrets.enc.yaml` (600 permissions)
- **age encryption**: Modern cryptography, more secure than PGP
- **No environment exposure**: Secrets never in `ps aux`, `env`, or shell history
- **No plaintext**: Secrets not stored in `.bashrc` or configuration files
- **Automatic cleanup**: Environment variables cleared after encryption

### Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. On host: Add API key
flyctl secrets set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-abc123 -a sindri-dev

# 2. VM restarts (automatic or manual)
flyctl machine restart <machine-id> -a sindri-dev

# 3. SSH to VM
ssh developer@sindri-dev.fly.dev -p 10022

# 4. Use Claude - already authenticated
claude

# Secret is encrypted in ~/.secrets/secrets.enc.yaml
# Never appears in environment or process list
```

## Common Operations

### Troubleshooting

```bash
flyctl status -a <app-name>          # Check VM health
flyctl logs -a <app-name>            # View system logs
flyctl machine restart <id>          # Restart if unresponsive
ssh -vvv developer@<app>.fly.dev -p 10022  # Debug SSH
```

### Cost Monitoring

```bash
./scripts/cost-monitor.sh            # Check usage and costs
./scripts/vm-suspend.sh              # Manual suspend
```

## SSH Architecture Notes

The environment provides dual SSH access:

- **Production SSH**: External port 10022 → Internal port 2222 (custom daemon)
- **Hallpass SSH**: `flyctl ssh console` via Fly.io's built-in service (port 22)

In CI mode (`CI_MODE=true`), the custom SSH daemon is disabled to prevent port conflicts with Fly.io's hallpass service,
ensuring reliable automated deployments.

### CI Mode Limitations and Troubleshooting

**SSH Command Execution in CI Mode:**

- Complex multi-line shell commands may fail after machine restarts
- Always use explicit shell invocation: `/bin/bash -c 'command'`
- Avoid nested quotes and complex variable substitution
- Use retry logic for commands executed immediately after restart

**Volume Persistence Verification:**

- Volumes persist correctly, but SSH environment may need time to initialize after restart
- Add machine readiness checks before testing persistence
- Use simple commands to verify mount points and permissions

**Common Issues:**

- `exec: "if": executable file not found in $PATH` - Use explicit bash invocation
- SSH connection timeouts after restart - Add retry logic with delays
- Environment variables not available - Check shell environment setup

**Best Practices for CI Testing:**

- Always verify machine status before running tests
- Use explicit error handling and debugging output
- Split complex operations into simple, atomic commands
- Add volume mount verification before persistence tests

## Important Instructions

- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files to creating new ones
- NEVER proactively create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- Only use emojis if explicitly requested by the user
