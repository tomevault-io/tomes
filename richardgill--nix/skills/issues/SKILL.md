# Issue Management

Manage the project's persistent work tracker in `thoughts/shared/issues/`.

## Issue & Plan Storage

Issues and plans are tracked in `./issues/` with numbered phases:

```
./issues/
├── 10-phase-name/           # Single issue = flat folder
│   └── plan.md
├── 20-another-phase/
│   ├── plan.md
│   └── design.md          # Optional
├── 30-multi-issue-phase/    # Multiple parallel issues = nested
│   ├── feature-a/
│   │   ├── plan.md
│   │   └── design.md
│   └── feature-b/
│       └── plan.md
└── done/                    # Completed issues moved here
```

**Conventions:**
- **Single issue phase** → `NN-phase-name/` (flat)
- **Multi-issue phase** → `NN-phase/issue-name/` (nested, all parallel)
- **Gaps in numbers** (10, 20...) = room to insert phases later
- Each issue has `plan.md` + optional `design.md`
- **Completed issues** → move to `done/`

**Workflow:**
1. Work through phases in order (10 → 20 → 30...)
2. Within a phase folder, pick any issue - they're independent
3. Read issue's `plan.md` for scope

## Commands

### List Active Issues
```bash
ls -1d thoughts/shared/issues/*/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v done/
```

### Show What's Next
```bash
ls -1d thoughts/shared/issues/*/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v done/ | head -1
```

### Create Issue

1. Check existing phases: `ls thoughts/shared/issues/`
2. Pick phase number (use gaps like 10, 20, 30 for flexibility)
3. Create folder:
   - Single issue: `thoughts/shared/issues/NN-issue-name/`
   - Multi-issue phase: `thoughts/shared/issues/NN-phase/issue-name/`
4. Add `plan.md` with scope and implementation details
5. Optionally add `design.md` for design notes

### Complete Issue

Move to done when fully implemented:
```bash
mkdir -p thoughts/shared/issues/done
mv thoughts/shared/issues/NN-issue-name thoughts/shared/issues/done/
```

### Show Progress
```bash
echo "Active:" && ls -1d thoughts/shared/issues/*/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v done/ | wc -l
echo "Done:" && ls -1d thoughts/shared/issues/done/*/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

### Triage/Prioritize

1. Review all phases: `ls -la thoughts/shared/issues/`
2. Check recent work to identify completed issues:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -20
   git diff main~10..main --stat
   ```
3. Move completed issues to done
4. Renumber folders to reorder priority
5. Move items between phases as needed
6. Update any `plan.md` files with new scope
