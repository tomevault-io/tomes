# oneshot

Outer loop: `sdp-orchestrate` (or `sdp orchestrate` if available) drives phases. You execute @build and @review inline.

**Run orchestrate:** Either `sdp-orchestrate` on PATH, or from project root: `go run ./cmd/sdp-orchestrate`. See AGENTS.md for build/install.

## Rules

0. **Scope** — Do not change workstream scope mid-run. If scope must change, stop and start a new run.
1. **Get next action** — Run `sdp-orchestrate --feature F{XX} --next-action`. Parse the JSON output (schema: `sdp/schema/next-action.schema.json`).
2. **Execute phase and advance** — For `build`: run @build {ws_id}, commit, then `sdp-orchestrate --feature F{XX} --advance --result $(git rev-parse HEAD)`. For `review`: run @review F{XX}, fix P0/P1 until approved (max 3 iterations), then `sdp-orchestrate --feature F{XX} --advance`. **One advance per phase** — run `--advance` exactly once after build, exactly once after review. PR and CI run automatically. When action is `done`, output only: `CI GREEN - @oneshot complete`.

## Post-compaction

If context was compacted, read `.sdp/checkpoints/F{XX}.json` and `git checkout $(jq -r .branch .sdp/checkpoints/F{XX}.json)`. Resume from step 1.

## Claude Code

Use Task tool to spawn @build and @review subagents. Each subagent gets a fresh context window. Stop hook blocks premature exit when CI phase is incomplete.
