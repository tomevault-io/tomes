  # Dashboard Layout Patterns

  ## When to Use
  - Creating new dashboard pages
  - Adding sidebar navigation sections
  - Building responsive grid layouts for data panels

  ## Instructions
  1. Use the existing DashboardShell component as the page wrapper
  2. Sidebar items defined in src/config/navigation.ts
  3. Grid layouts use CSS Grid with Tailwind: grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3
  4. All panels should have loading skeletons
  5. Mobile: sidebar collapses to hamburger menu
