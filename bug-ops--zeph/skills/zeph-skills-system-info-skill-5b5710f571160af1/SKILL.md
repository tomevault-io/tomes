# System Info

Collect host diagnostics and resource metrics.

Before running commands, detect the OS and load the matching reference for
platform-specific syntax:

- **Linux** — `references/linux.md` (procfs, sysfs, GNU coreutils)
- **macOS** — `references/macos.md` (sysctl, vm_stat, diskutil, system_profiler)
- **Windows** — `references/windows.md` (PowerShell: Get-CimInstance, Get-Counter, Get-Process)

OS detection:
```bash
uname -s 2>/dev/null || echo Windows
```

## Workflow

1. Gather only the metrics the user requested — do not dump everything.
2. Prefer read-only, non-invasive commands. Never change system settings unless explicitly asked.
3. If a command is unavailable, check the OS reference for a fallback.
4. Return a short summary with key numbers (percentages, GB, top processes).
5. Flag values that indicate problems (see thresholds below).

## Diagnostic categories

### OS and kernel
Identify the operating system, distribution, kernel version, hostname, and architecture. Useful as a starting point for any troubleshooting session.

Key information to collect:
- OS name and version (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04, macOS 15.2, Windows 11 23H2)
- Kernel version
- System architecture (x86_64, arm64)
- Hostname

### Uptime and load average
Determine how long the system has been running and its current load.

Interpreting load average (Unix):
- Three numbers represent 1-minute, 5-minute, and 15-minute averages
- Compare against CPU core count: load equal to core count means full utilization
- Load consistently above core count indicates CPU contention
- Rising trend (1min > 5min > 15min) means load is increasing

### CPU
Inspect processor model, core count, current utilization, and per-core activity.

| Metric | Healthy | Warning | Critical |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| Overall utilization | < 70% | 70-90% | > 90% sustained |
| Load avg / core count | < 1.0 | 1.0-2.0 | > 2.0 |
| I/O wait | < 10% | 10-30% | > 30% |

### Memory
Check total, used, free, available, cached, and buffered memory plus swap usage.

| Metric | Healthy | Warning | Critical |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| Available memory | > 20% of total | 10-20% | < 10% |
| Swap usage | < 10% of total swap | 10-50% | > 50% |

Interpreting memory on Linux:
- "available" (not "free") is the true indicator of remaining capacity
- High "buff/cache" is normal and healthy — the kernel uses spare RAM for caching
- Swap usage above zero is not inherently bad, but heavy swap I/O indicates memory pressure

Interpreting memory on macOS:
- `vm_stat` reports in pages (typically 16384 bytes on Apple Silicon, 4096 on Intel)
- `memory_pressure` gives a simple "normal / warn / critical" assessment
- "Pages purgeable" and "Pages cached" are reclaimable — not a concern

### Disk and filesystem
Review disk space, mount points, inode usage, and I/O throughput.

| Metric | Healthy | Warning | Critical |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| Disk usage | < 80% | 80-90% | > 90% |
| Inode usage | < 80% | 80-90% | > 90% |

Common culprits for disk pressure:
- Log files (`/var/log/`, application logs)
- Build artifacts (`target/`, `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`)
- Docker images and volumes
- Package manager caches

### Processes
List running processes, identify top resource consumers, find specific processes by name or PID.

Useful views:
- Top CPU consumers (top 10 by CPU %)
- Top memory consumers (top 10 by RSS)
- Process tree (parent-child relationships)
- Zombie or defunct processes
- Processes by a specific user

### Network
Inspect network interfaces, IP addresses, open ports, active connections, and routing.

Common checks:
- List interfaces and their IP addresses
- Show listening ports and the processes bound to them
- Display active connections (established TCP)
- Check DNS resolution
- Test connectivity to a remote host

### Hardware
Retrieve details about physical hardware: CPU model, RAM modules, GPU, storage devices, USB peripherals.

### Installed software
List installed packages, language runtimes, and key tool versions. Useful for environment replication and debugging compatibility issues.

## Quick reference: cross-platform command map

| Task | Linux | macOS | Windows (PowerShell) |
|------|-------|-------|---------------------|
| OS version | `cat /etc/os-release` | `sw_vers` | `Get-ComputerInfo` |
| Kernel | `uname -r` | `uname -r` | `[Environment]::OSVersion` |
| Uptime | `uptime` | `uptime` | `(Get-Date) - (gcim Win32_OS).LastBootUpTime` |
| CPU info | `lscpu` | `sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string` | `gcim Win32_Processor` |
| Memory | `free -h` | `vm_stat` | `gcim Win32_OperatingSystem` |
| Disk space | `df -h` | `df -h` | `Get-PSDrive -PSProvider FileSystem` |
| Top processes | `ps aux --sort=-%cpu \| head` | `ps aux -r \| head` | `Get-Process \| Sort CPU -Desc \| Select -First 10` |
| Open ports | `ss -tlnp` | `lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN` | `Get-NetTCPConnection -State Listen` |
| Network IFs | `ip addr` | `ifconfig` | `Get-NetIPAddress` |

## Output interpretation guidelines

When presenting results to the user:

1. **Lead with the answer.** State the key finding first ("Disk is 94% full on `/`"), then provide supporting data.
2. **Use human-readable units.** Always prefer GB/MB over raw bytes, percentages over absolute numbers where both are available.
3. **Highlight anomalies.** If any metric falls in the Warning or Critical range, call it out explicitly.
4. **Provide actionable next steps.** If disk is full, suggest what to clean. If a process is consuming excessive CPU, name it and suggest investigation commands.
5. **Compare against baselines.** When the user asks "is this normal?", use the threshold tables above as reference points.

## Common troubleshooting patterns

### System is slow
1. Check load average vs core count (CPU contention).
2. Check available memory and swap activity (memory pressure).
3. Check disk I/O wait (storage bottleneck).
4. Identify top CPU and memory consumers.

### Out of disk space
1. Check `df -h` for filesystem usage.
2. Find largest directories with `du -sh /* | sort -rh | head`.
3. Check for large log files, build artifacts, and package caches.
4. Check inode usage (`df -i`) — many small files can exhaust inodes before space.

### Process investigation
1. Find the process by name or PID.
2. Check its CPU and memory usage over time.
3. Examine open files and network connections (`lsof -p PID`).
4. Check parent process to understand how it was started.

### Network connectivity issues
1. Check if the interface is up and has an IP address.
2. Test DNS resolution (`dig`, `nslookup`).
3. Test connectivity with `ping` or `curl`.
4. Check listening ports and firewall rules.
5. Review routing table for misconfigurations.
