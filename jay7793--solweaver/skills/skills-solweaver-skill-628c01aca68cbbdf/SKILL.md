# Solweaver

Coordinate execution without delegating orchestration itself. Keep the main
agent on the critical path. Work solo or use the smallest team that materially
improves speed, context isolation, or review quality.

## Preflight

1. Classify the request before spawning agents.
2. Read applicable `AGENTS.md` files and repository guidance. Confirm the
   working directory, branch or worktree, and existing changes before assigning
   ownership.
3. Keep the active parent as orchestrator. Require `gpt-5.6-sol` as the parent
   model, but allow any reasoning effort reported by the current `turn_context`.
   This skill cannot select or prove the runtime.
4. Inspect agent availability only when the selected path actually needs an
   agent. Auto or solo execution with standard assurance does not require a
   worker or reviewer to be available. Do not silently substitute a missing
   agent when an explicit mode or assurance gate requires it.
5. Describe model evidence precisely:
   - **Observed**: current session `turn_context` reports model and effort.
   - **Configured**: a validated agent definition pins the value, but runtime
     metadata does not expose it.
   - **Unverified**: neither source establishes the value.
6. If the observed parent model is not `gpt-5.6-sol`, stop before
   implementation and direct the user to select that model. Do not reject an
   observed Sol parent based on its reasoning effort. If the parent model or
   effort metadata is unavailable, do not claim the parent runtime gate passed.
7. Enforce the package-owned child identity matrix: `terra_worker` requires
   `model == "gpt-5.6-terra"` and `effort == "max"`; `luna_worker` requires
   `model == "gpt-5.6-luna"` and `effort == "max"`; and
   `solweaver_reviewer` requires `model == "gpt-5.6-sol"` and
   `effort == "max"`.
8. After every package-owned child turn, inspect the child session
   `turn_context` before accepting its report or verdict. If the active surface
   omits it, search the persisted child rollout before declaring runtime
   metadata unavailable; use `scripts/extract_child_runtime.py` to bind the
   rollout to the expected parent, child role/path, worktree, model, and effort,
   and record its hash plus ordinals or version-gated physical record indices.
   If either value differs or no actual
   `turn_context` can be proved, mark the lane mismatched or unverified and apply
   the handling in [references/contracts.md](references/contracts.md). A
   model-generated self-report, task label, UI name, or agent definition is not
   runtime proof.
9. Do not impose a fixed model gate on optional platform specialists that this
   package does not define. Report their runtime as observed, configured, or
   unverified, and honor any explicit runtime requirement from the user.
10. Preserve user changes, repository boundaries, and explicit external-action
    approval requirements.
11. Keep Solweaver project-neutral. Discover language, framework, commands,
    repository layout, product contracts, and evidence conventions from the
    active workspace. Keep project-specific names, paths, requirements, and
    governance in task-local artifacts rather than the Solweaver package.
12. After installing or changing Solweaver definitions, run
    `scripts/validate_install.py`, restart Codex or open a new task, and follow
    [references/runtime-smoke-test.md](references/runtime-smoke-test.md) before
    describing the workflow as runtime-certified.
13. Build a repository verification profile once from applicable `AGENTS.md`,
    package scripts, CI, task runners, and Compose configuration. Separate
    narrow `FOCUSED_CHECKS` used during implementation from repository-wide
    `CANDIDATE_CHECKS` and any full `COMPOSE_CHECK`. Treat full verify, full
    build, full E2E, and full Compose rehearsals as candidate-boundary gates
    unless the repository or user explicitly requires an earlier run.
14. For every feature, bug fix, refactor, or behavior change, load the bundled
    `$test-driven-development` skill before writing production code. It owns the
    RED-GREEN-REFACTOR discipline while Solweaver continues to own orchestration,
    integration, and candidate verification. When writing or changing tests,
    read its `writing-good-tests.md` reference. Pass the same requirement to
    every production-code worker. If the bundled skill is missing or fails
    installed-copy integrity validation, stop before implementation and repair
    the installation. Do not force TDD onto documentation, research,
    operations-only work, generated code, configuration-only changes, or an
    explicitly authorized throwaway prototype beyond the TDD skill's own
    applicability and exception contract.

## Choose execution mode

- Use **auto mode** when the user does not name a mode. Sol chooses local solo
  execution or the smallest useful team; invoking Solweaver alone does not
  require a subagent.
- For small, low-risk, low-coupling tasks in auto mode, prefer local solo
  execution with standard assurance. Do not spawn a worker or reviewer, create
  final-strict artifacts, or add phase machinery merely because Solweaver was
  invoked.
- Use **solo mode** when the user wants Sol alone. Sol plans, implements,
  verifies, and delivers without spawning any worker or reviewer. Solo supports
  standard assurance only.
- Use **solo-reviewed mode** when the user wants Sol to implement alone with an
  independent final gate. Do not spawn implementation workers; after parent
  verification at the final-strict boundary, spawn one fresh
  `solweaver_reviewer` at a time and apply final-strict acceptance, including a
  fresh review after a fix round only while review budget remains.
  Solo-reviewed always uses final-strict assurance.
- Use **team mode** when the user explicitly requests delegation. Spawn at
  least one bounded implementation worker, while Sol retains integration and
  verification. Add the fresh reviewer only when a final-strict assurance unit
  reaches its gate.
- Honor an explicit mode without silently changing it. If solo mode conflicts
  with a user-requested or risk-triggered independent review, stop before
  implementation and ask the user to choose solo with standard assurance,
  solo-reviewed, or auto/team execution with final-strict assurance.

In auto mode, spawn only when at least one concrete benefit outweighs the
coordination cost: a disjoint lane can shorten the critical path, context
isolation reduces material risk, or the worker is a substantially better fit
for a bounded assignment. File count, task size labels, or skill invocation
alone are not reasons to delegate. Prefer one worker; add another only for
independent write scopes that can make useful progress concurrently.

## Choose assurance

- Use **standard assurance** for ordinary work in auto, solo, or team execution.
  Sol inspects the complete diff, reruns proportionate verification, and
  accepts or returns the work without final-strict artifacts or a reviewer.
- Use **final-strict assurance** when the user wants one independent review over
  a coherent completed phase or delivery unit, or when the change affects auth,
  authorization, secrets, tenant isolation, money, data integrity, migrations,
  destructive behavior, concurrency, public APIs, production-critical paths,
  or a wide architectural refactor. Before implementation, assign a stable
  `ASSURANCE_UNIT_ID`, set `REOPEN_GENERATION`, choose a durable
  `LEDGER_LOCATION` plus an exclusive `ATTEMPT_COORDINATION_LOCATION`, and
  record the exact base state, objective, acceptance criteria, final boundary,
  and cumulative evidence. Derive the identity from repository and product
  authority such as repository, track, and canonical phase or delivery ID;
  never derive it from a task, thread, worktree, branch, timestamp, or candidate
  SHA.
  Apply focused parent verification after every intermediate checkpoint, do
  not spawn `solweaver_reviewer` yet, and report only `checkpoint-ready`.
- At the declared final boundary, inspect the complete cumulative diff from the
  recorded base, run the repository-owned candidate checks and applicable full
  Compose rehearsal once for the frozen candidate, then pass the referenced
  final-strict readiness gate before applying the fresh reviewer gate and
  final-strict acceptance rules.
- Final-strict is Solweaver's only independent-review assurance mode. Auto and
  team use standard assurance unless final-strict is requested or
  risk-triggered; solo-reviewed always uses final-strict. Readiness must lead
  to a fresh `solweaver_reviewer` attempt; parent self-review never satisfies
  the independent gate.
- Record `REVIEW_BUDGET_MODE` before reviewer call 1. New assurance units use
  `default` with `TARGET_REVIEW_CALLS = 1` and `MAX_REVIEW_CALLS = 3`; the third
  call is contingency, not a target. Existing durable units keep their already
  recorded maximum, including historical `default` units capped at 2.
  `extended` remains a backwards-compatible legacy label for a predeclared
  maximum of 3 and grants no calls beyond the new default. Once any call is
  reserved, never increase or change the mode or maximum. Count every
  `solweaver_reviewer` spawn that
  begins execution, including attempts with missing or mismatched runtime
  metadata or an unusable verdict. Carry `REVIEW_CALLS_USED` across tasks,
  chats, continuations, worktrees, branches, spec revisions, and candidate
  commits. Never exceed the recorded maximum or reset it by renaming,
  splitting, or reopening unchanged scope. A three-call budget is not a
  substitute for making the assurance unit coherent and reviewable.
- Keep the assurance-unit ledger in the repository's existing phase, build, or
  evidence log when one is authoritative. Otherwise choose a user-authorized
  durable artifact before implementation. It must survive task context and be
  recoverable from another worktree or continuation. Never create a competing
  generic ledger when repository guidance defines another authority. If a
  prior final-strict attempt is mentioned or discoverable but its exact call
  count cannot be reconstructed, treat the remaining budget as unknown and do
  not spawn a reviewer as though the count were zero.
- Keep reviewer-attempt coordination in a durable sidecar or repository-provided
  lock/CAS facility outside the frozen behavior candidate. A Markdown journal
  alone is not a lock: record and use an exact atomic primitive, path or key,
  acquisition result, protected state transition, and release. It must support
  an exclusive atomic reservation across tasks and worktrees. Before a spawn,
  reserve one call with a unique `REVIEW_ATTEMPT_ID` and `CALL_STATE: reserved`;
  a reservation occupies the remaining budget. A lock-busy contender creates
  no reservation and consumes no call. After the child begins, mark it
  `started` and increment `REVIEW_CALLS_USED`. Release a reservation as
  `cancelled-before-start` only when exact tool evidence proves the child never
  began. After interruption or ambiguous recovery, count the reservation as
  consumed. If exclusive reservation is unavailable, reviewer spawn is
  forbidden.
- A missed-runtime terminal correction is the only evidence-only exception to
  terminal closure. Use it only when a generation was prematurely set to
  `blocked` or `blocked-external-boundary` solely because actual child
  `turn_context` was thought unavailable, exact persisted rollout evidence later
  proves the expected runtime, the candidate and closure evidence are unchanged,
  a predeclared call remains unreserved and unused, and no protected boundary
  was crossed. Under the same exclusive primitive, preserve terminal history and
  all counters, correct the completed attempt, set `UNIT_STATUS: open` with
  `REVIEW_READY: no`, then rerun refreeze, adversarial, closure-matrix, and full
  readiness gates before reserving the remaining call. This is not a generation
  reopen and never replenishes budget. Read the exact gate in
  [references/contracts.md](references/contracts.md).
- Record a `FROZEN_CANDIDATE_ID` for the complete declared behavior scope and a
  separate `ASSURANCE_PACKET_ID` for the ledger, attempt journal, and evidence
  snapshot. Exclude only the declared ledger and coordination artifacts from
  the behavior-candidate identity; never omit product, test, contract, or other
  changed scope. Attempt accounting changes the assurance packet but does not
  invalidate the frozen candidate. Any change outside those declared artifacts
  requires candidate refreeze and a full readiness rerun.
  Include staged, unstaged, and untracked files inside the declared scope;
  `git diff` alone is not a complete candidate identity when untracked files
  exist.
- Before reserving any reviewer call, write a canonical
  `FINAL_STRICT_READINESS_RECORD` and run
  `scripts/validate_final_strict_packet.py` against the exact ledger, attempt
  journal, reviewer packet, and candidate manifest, plus the delivery manifest
  when applicable. Persist its passing JSON proof and SHA-256 identities at
  `FINAL_STRICT_READINESS_RECORD_LOCATION`. Prose assertions or a manually
  assembled packet do not replace this machine gate. Any later mutation makes
  the proof stale and requires regeneration before reservation.
- When installed, generated, or runtime-loaded copies are part of the declared
  acceptance boundary, bind their actual content into `FROZEN_CANDIDATE_ID`
  with a deterministic `DELIVERY_ARTIFACT_MANIFEST`. Point-in-time parity alone
  is evidence, not immutable identity. Use
  `scripts/compute_delivery_manifest.py` with stable logical labels and persist
  its full versioned per-file records, aggregate, and exact command at
  `DELIVERY_ARTIFACT_MANIFEST_LOCATION`; an unexplained aggregate is not
  reproducible. For Solweaver package installation or release, include both the
  installed `solweaver` and `test-driven-development` skill trees plus agent
  definitions; the bundled TDD license and provenance are part of the delivery
  boundary. Mark installed copies not applicable only when they are genuinely
  outside the boundary.
- Permit final-strict execution during high-risk implementation only
  while it remains reversible and no protected boundary is crossed. Before a
  destructive migration, real money movement, production auth or authorization
  change, deploy, merge, release, or other irreversible external mutation,
  complete the final-strict gate for the relevant cumulative change or stop.
- Before the first reviewer call, pass the referenced reviewability gate: one
  coherent objective, explicit invariant and risk surfaces, a complete diff
  that one reviewer can inspect in a single full pass, and captured cross-unit
  interactions. If it fails, redefine the delivery units before call 1;
  extended budget cannot repair incoherent scope. After a reviewer begins,
  splitting or renaming scope never replenishes the budget. Never omit parts
  of the diff merely to preserve the one-review target.
- Never describe solo execution or a parent self-review as independent review.
  Never describe an intermediate final-strict checkpoint as `ship` or
  final-strict acceptance.

## Plan and decompose

1. Form a short outcome-focused plan before implementation or delegation.
2. Record `TDD_REQUIRED: yes` for production-code behavior changes or
   `TDD_REQUIRED: no` with the exact applicability reason. When required,
   identify the first observable test seam and RED command before implementation.
3. Identify the immediate blocker and keep it with the parent when local
   progress depends on it.
4. Split only bounded work. Parallelize only assignments that are independent
   and have disjoint write ownership.
5. Read [references/contracts.md](references/contracts.md) before the first
   delegated write or final-strict review in a task.
6. Send every worker the complete task packet from that reference. Use
   `fork_turns="none"` when selecting a custom worker so the packet, not leaked
   parent context, defines the assignment.
7. Keep delegated communication and reports in English by default. Set another
   report language explicitly in the task packet only when the user-facing
   workflow or parent integration needs it. Repository content still follows
   the task and repository conventions.
8. Keep shared-file edits, unresolved design decisions, and dependency chains
   serial.

## Select agents

Apply the selected execution mode before routing:

- In solo mode, do not spawn any agent.
- In solo-reviewed mode, spawn no implementation worker and reserve reviewer
  spawns for the final-strict gate and any required re-review.
- In team mode, spawn at least one bounded implementation worker.
- In auto mode, spawn only agents that materially improve the outcome.

- Use `terra_worker` for the default implementation path and for ambiguous,
  coupled, multi-file, architecture-sensitive, backend, frontend, database,
  integration, debugging, and refactoring work.
- Use `luna_worker` when the assignment is narrow, low-coupling, mechanical, or
  high-throughput with explicit acceptance criteria. Good fits include isolated
  tests, fixtures, documentation-adjacent code, repetitive migrations, and
  independent file clusters.
- Use `solweaver_reviewer` only as a fresh, read-only reviewer. It never
  implements its own findings.
- Prefer Terra and final-strict assurance when incorrect routing could affect a
  high-risk boundary.
- Use `code_mapper`, `tester`, `reviewer`, or `security_reviewer` only when the
  current runtime exposes them and their specialization materially helps.
- Use another implementation agent only when the user explicitly requests it.

When workers are allowed, parallelize disjoint assignments within the
configured concurrency limit; the limit is a ceiling, not a target. Terra and
Luna may run together only when their ownership is disjoint.

## Coordinate execution

Apply these rules to active subagents. In solo mode, keep all execution local
to the parent.

1. Tell every writing agent it is not alone in the codebase, must preserve
   unrelated edits, and owns only its assigned scope.
2. Assume native subagents share the active working tree unless the host
   explicitly reports an isolated worktree. Disjoint file ownership is not the
   same as filesystem isolation.
3. Create a separate user-visible task or worktree only when the user explicitly
   authorizes that action and the current surface supports it.
4. Continue parent-owned inspection, integration planning, or blocker work
   while independent agents run.
5. Track dependencies and progress. Correct missing evidence or scope drift in
   the responsible worker; do not create a replacement merely to avoid a
   correction loop.
6. Resolve overlaps and conflicts centrally. Never ask workers to orchestrate
   the team.
7. If a Terra or Luna runtime gate fails, do not accept the worker report as
   evidence or count that lane as correctly routed. Inspect the shared
   worktree and complete diff, preserve all unrelated changes, and never roll
   back child edits automatically.
8. In auto mode, Sol may take ownership of inspected changes and verify them
   locally, but must report the failed worker lane. In explicit team mode,
   pause before further implementation and make at most one corrected
   re-dispatch when the expected runtime is available; otherwise request user
   direction. Never downgrade an explicit team request silently.

## Integrate and verify

1. When workers exist, treat their reports as claims. In every mode, inspect
   the working tree, complete diff, and changed-file scope.
2. Review for correctness, maintainability, contract compatibility, and
   interaction with concurrent edits.
3. When `TDD_REQUIRED: yes`, verify that each behavior slice has observed RED
   evidence from the real test seam before its production implementation,
   minimal GREEN evidence, and a green REFACTOR check. A test written after the
   implementation or a full candidate suite run cannot retroactively satisfy
   TDD. Keep this evidence focused; it does not trigger repository-wide gates.
4. During implementation and intermediate checkpoints, run only the narrowest
   focused checks that can catch the current defect or regression. Do not rerun
   repository-wide verify/build/E2E commands or a full Compose rehearsal after
   every edit, worker return, or checkpoint.
5. Use the repository verification profile to define the candidate boundary:
   immediately before independent review in final-strict or solo-reviewed work,
   and immediately before commit or final delivery in standard assurance. At
   that boundary, run each applicable repository-wide `CANDIDATE_CHECK` once
   against the complete candidate. Start or reuse the local Compose environment
   once, health-check it, run the full `COMPOSE_CHECK` once, and tear it down
   once when repository policy requires teardown. File presence alone does not
   make Compose applicable; require repository guidance, a declared script, or
   acceptance criteria.
6. If a candidate gate fails, use focused checks while fixing the failure, then
   run one new complete candidate-gate pass after the fixes are batched. Do not
   blindly repeat successful full lanes between edits. A changed behavior
   candidate normally invalidates prior full-gate evidence; reuse it only when
   repository-owned caching/affected semantics or direct scope proof establishes
   that the command's inputs are unchanged.
7. When only declared assurance metadata changes and `FROZEN_CANDIDATE_ID` is
   unchanged, reuse the exact bound candidate verification and Compose receipts;
   rerun only packet/readiness validation. Distinguish static, unit,
   integration, runtime, acceptance, delivery, and production evidence; one
   level does not prove another.
8. Compare the evidence with the original acceptance criteria and note anything
   not run or not proved. Repository or user instructions that explicitly
   require a particular early gate override the default deferral; high-risk
   focused integration evidence may also run early when it directly reduces
   money, migration, concurrency, or destructive-operation risk.
9. In final-strict mode at each intermediate checkpoint, update the durable
   assurance-unit ledger with changed scope, verification, decisions, and
   known gaps.
   Do not spawn the final-strict reviewer and do not claim more than
   `checkpoint-ready`.
10. At the final-strict boundary, re-establish the recorded base, inspect the
   complete cumulative diff, reconcile every checkpoint with the assurance-unit
   acceptance criteria, and bind the fresh candidate-check and Compose receipts
   to the exact frozen candidate.
   Then perform a distinct parent adversarial pass over the frozen scope. Build
   a proportionate risk-surface map and counterexample matrix; inspect negative
   paths, changed-to-unchanged interactions, fix-induced regressions, and
   test-sensitivity evidence. Mark an item not applicable only with a concrete
   reason. This parent challenge is not independent review.
11. If final-strict work approaches a protected irreversible or production
   boundary before the declared end, treat that boundary as the final gate for
   the relevant accumulated change. Do not cross it with deferred review.
12. At a final-strict boundary, including solo-reviewed execution, complete the
   referenced readiness gate. Require a durable loaded ledger, stable identity,
   recorded review-budget mode, exact base, `FROZEN_CANDIDATE_ID`,
   `ASSURANCE_PACKET_ID`, fully classified acceptance criteria, resolved product
   and architecture decisions, a passed reviewability gate, complete cumulative
   diff, any required `DELIVERY_ARTIFACT_MANIFEST`,
   `PARENT_ADVERSARIAL_READY: yes`, every applicable parent gate green
   with no `missing` or `not_run`, fresh candidate-bound full verification and
   Compose evidence when applicable, justified `not-applicable` entries, working
   exclusive attempt coordination with durable acquisition proof,
   `UNIT_STATUS: open`, and `REVIEW_READY: yes`. A known gap is
   allowed only when the acceptance contract explicitly permits it and it
   cannot hide blocking risk. If any item fails, remain `checkpoint-ready`; the
   reviewer is forbidden and no review call is consumed.
13. When readiness is green, acquire exclusive attempt coordination, reread the
   durable ledger, and atomically verify the intended identity and generation,
   `UNIT_STATUS: open`, `REVIEW_READY: yes`, remaining budget, and no active
   reservation. Record `THIS_CALL`, a unique `REVIEW_ATTEMPT_ID`, and
   `CALL_STATE: reserved` before releasing the lock. Then spawn a fresh
   `solweaver_reviewer` with `fork_turns="none"` after parent verification and
   send both candidate and assurance-packet identities. When the child begins,
   reacquire coordination and atomically mark the attempt `started` plus
   increment `REVIEW_CALLS_USED`. If exact tool evidence proves it never began,
   mark `cancelled-before-start` and release the reservation. On interruption
   or uncertainty, recover the reservation as consumed. Require exactly
   `ship`, `fix-first`, or `rethink` and never rely on an in-memory-only counter.
14. Before accepting the verdict, inspect the reviewer child session
   `turn_context`. If it is absent from the active surface, run
   `scripts/extract_child_runtime.py` against the exact persisted child rollout
   before classifying the gate. Accept it only when `model == "gpt-5.6-sol"` and
   `effort == "max"`. Reject missing or mismatched metadata and do not count the
   verdict as final-strict-review evidence. Never use a model-generated
   self-report as runtime proof. The failed attempt still consumes one review
   call because it began execution. Under exclusive coordination, finish the
   attempt as `completed` with its observed runtime gate and verdict or unusable
   outcome, then clear `ACTIVE_REVIEW_RESERVATION`. In the same protected
   transition set `UNIT_STATUS: ship` for an accepted `ship`, leave it `open`
   only when a predeclared call remains, or set
   `REVIEW_STATUS: review-exhausted` with `UNIT_STATUS: parent-recovery` after a
   non-`ship` final budget call. Any status other than `open` forbids another
   reservation in that generation even when numeric budget remains.
   Before completing a `fix-first` attempt, allow one bounded
   `SAME_ATTEMPT_METADATA_CLOSURE` only when the reviewer classifies every
   blocker as `assurance-metadata-only`, reports `BEHAVIOR_BLOCKERS: none`,
   `CANDIDATE_CHANGE_REQUIRED: no`, and `AUDIT_COMPLETENESS: complete`. Keep the
   same child, reservation, `REVIEW_ATTEMPT_ID`, and frozen candidate; edit only
   declared assurance metadata, regenerate and pass the machine readiness
   proof in `same-attempt-metadata-closure` phase with the active attempt ID,
   then send one follow-up to that same reviewer. This is not another
   spawn or review call. One closure round is the maximum; any behavior change,
   incomplete audit, new blocker, or second non-`ship` result completes the
   attempt and enters normal re-review handling.
15. After any consumed call that does not produce a valid accepted `ship`,
   close that reviewer. If recorded budget remains, enter the universal
   re-review preparation gate. This includes `fix-first`, `rethink`, an
   unusable or malformed verdict, and a missing or mismatched runtime gate.
   Return concrete findings to the responsible worker, or fix them in the
   parent for solo-reviewed execution; reconcile architecture and scope on
   `rethink`; and correct packet, capacity, or runtime prerequisites for an
   unusable attempt.
   Use focused checks while implementing behavior fixes. After all fixes are
   batched, refreeze the candidate and run the candidate-bound full verification
   and Compose gates once for that new frozen candidate. When no behavior or
   candidate input changed, reuse the prior bound receipts. Then rerun parent
   adversarial readiness and the complete readiness gate, and complete the
   referenced `re-review closure matrix` before reserving the next call. The
   matrix is required even when no source file changed. Each fresh reviewer
   still inspects the full cumulative diff and may reject closure or raise a
   new finding, but every blocker must meet the referenced evidence bar and
   later-call findings must classify their origin. Scope, outcome type, or
   candidate changes never reset the budget.
   If the prior runtime gate was missing or mismatched, configured agent files
   do not close it: require `RUNTIME_AVAILABILITY_CLOSURE` with exact platform
   evidence that child `turn_context` will be exposed for the intended role
   before spending another call. Persisted actual child `turn_context` recovered
   with `scripts/extract_child_runtime.py` is exact proof for that completed
   attempt. If a premature runtime-only terminal transition already occurred,
   apply the missed-runtime terminal correction gate before any readiness rerun;
   otherwise terminal state remains closed. If the prerequisite cannot be
   proved, do not spawn and preserve the remaining call.
16. When a call does not produce a valid `ship` and no recorded budget remains,
   atomically set `REVIEW_STATUS: review-exhausted` and
   `UNIT_STATUS: parent-recovery`, then enter parent-owned completion. Review
   is closed, but parent recovery in the same generation may refreeze the
   candidate without creating or replenishing reviewer budget.
   Perform the referenced design/acceptance reconciliation, make the narrowest
   conservative decisions consistent with the original goal and repository
   contracts, implement every addressable fix with focused checks, inspect the
   complete diff, then run candidate-bound full verification once after the
   recovery candidate is stable. Do not ask the user merely to resolve
   review exhaustion. Do not exceed the recorded maximum, raise the budget,
   reset the counter, switch workflows, lower the review bar, or claim
   final-strict completion.
17. Only a valid `ship` within the recorded budget permits final-strict
   acceptance. Without it, finish authorized reversible work as
   `WORK_STATUS: complete`, `ACCEPTANCE_STATUS: met`, `KNOWN_BLOCKERS: none`,
   `INDEPENDENT_ATTESTATION: not-obtained-within-budget`, and
   `FINAL_STATUS: parent-completed` with
   `ASSURANCE_STATUS: final-strict-not-achieved` only after every addressable
   blocker is resolved. If a genuine external decision or protected boundary
   prevents completion, report the exact blocked status instead. Atomically
   finish recovery as `UNIT_STATUS: parent-completed`, `blocked`, or
   `blocked-external-boundary`; none permits another reviewer reservation.
   Never invent
   authority for deploy, merge, release, money movement, destructive migration
   execution, or another protected external action; leave it unexecuted.
   A terminal `parent-completed` unit may cross a specifically named protected
   release boundary only through `OWNER_ACCEPTED_PARENT_COMPLETED_RELEASE`:
   require exact user acceptance of the unit, frozen candidate or commit, the
   `final-strict-not-achieved` limitation, and the named action; require current
   release preflight to be green; record the authority and scope durably; and
   keep `FINAL_STATUS`, `ASSURANCE_STATUS`, and reviewer verdict unchanged.
   This is explicit risk acceptance, never reviewer `ship`, and never implied
   authority for destructive migration execution or real money movement.
   Release preflight must classify external findings as
   `candidate-introduced`, `candidate-exposure-increased`, or
   `baseline-unchanged`. The first two remain blockers. A baseline-unchanged
   finding is tracked and may proceed only under explicit owner acceptance;
   it must not be mislabeled as a candidate blocker without a reachable changed
   interaction.
18. A valid `ship` or a terminal parent-recovery result closes the current
   assurance unit generation. Review exhaustion closes only the independent
   review lane; it does not forbid addressable parent recovery inside the same
   generation and never replenishes calls. Non-behavioral evidence or status
   closure does not reopen it, except the narrowly defined missed-runtime
   terminal correction for a premature runtime-only `blocked` result. That
   correction restores the same generation and remaining budget; it never
   resets either.
   Later behavior-changing work requires an explicitly authorized incremented
   `REOPEN_GENERATION`, a durable reason, and material new scope. Never reopen
   unchanged code or unresolved findings merely to obtain more review calls.
19. After every terminal result—valid `ship`, `parent-completed`, `blocked`, or
   `blocked-external-boundary`—record the referenced post-phase retrospective.
   Capture candidate attempts, evidence reruns, reserved and started reviewer
   calls, finding classes, preventable waste, and at most three generalizable

## Deliver

Lead with the usable outcome. Report changed files, verification actually run,
the execution mode, assurance mode, final-strict base and boundary when
applicable, `ASSURANCE_UNIT_ID`, `REOPEN_GENERATION`, ledger location,
attempt-coordination location, `FROZEN_CANDIDATE_ID`, `ASSURANCE_PACKET_ID`,
repository verification profile, focused checks, candidate-wide verification
and Compose receipts, full-gate execution counts and any justified evidence
reuse, readiness record and machine-gate result, reviewer verdict, reserved and
started call counts, attempt states, same-attempt metadata closure, re-review
rounds, child runtime checks and any mismatched or unverified
lanes, review-budget mode and exhaustion, `WORK_STATUS`, `ACCEPTANCE_STATUS`,
`KNOWN_BLOCKERS`, `INDEPENDENT_ATTESTATION`, final and assurance status when
applicable, owner-accepted release authority and delta-risk classification when
used, post-phase retrospective status, remaining risks or unsupported behavior,
and any protected external action left unexecuted. Lead with work and
acceptance state so lack of independent attestation is not mistaken for
unfinished implementation. Do not describe configured routing as observed
runtime, or repository checks as live production evidence. Do not deploy,
mutate production, commit, merge, push, or open a pull request unless the user
authorized that external action.
