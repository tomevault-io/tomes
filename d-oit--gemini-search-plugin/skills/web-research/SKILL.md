# Web Research with Gemini Search

This skill enables efficient web research using the gemini-search agent, which provides context isolation for 30-40% token savings and includes built-in caching to avoid redundant searches.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when you need to:
- Research documentation from official sources
- Gather best practices and examples
- Find current information about tools, libraries, or frameworks
- Research GitHub workflows, CI/CD patterns
- Look up API documentation
- Find examples of code patterns
- Research security best practices
- Gather information about error messages or issues

## How It Works

This skill uses the **gemini-search agent** (available in this plugin) which:
- Performs web searches in an isolated context (saves 30-40% tokens)
- Caches results for 1 hour (configurable via `GEMINI_SEARCH_CACHE_TTL`)
- Tracks analytics (cache hits, query patterns, token savings)
- Provides structured, relevant results

## Research Patterns

```

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Research Pattern

**Step 1:** Invoke the gemini-search agent via Task tool

```
Use the Task tool with:
- subagent_type: "gemini-search:gemini-search"
- description: "Research [topic]"
- prompt: "[Detailed research request as shown in patterns above]"
```

**Step 2:** Process the results

The agent will return structured results including:
- Summary of findings
- Key points and recommendations
- Source URLs for reference
- Relevant examples or code snippets

**Step 3:** Apply the research

Use the research findings to:
- Answer user questions with current information
- Implement features based on best practices
- Troubleshoot issues with verified solutions
- Make informed technical decisions

### Advanced Usage

**Multi-query research:**

When you need to research multiple related topics, invoke the agent multiple times with different queries:

```
1. Search for general overview/documentation
2. Search for specific best practices
3. Search for examples and use cases
4. Search for troubleshooting and common issues
```

**Targeted documentation search:**

For official documentation, include source constraints in your query:

```
"Claude Code skills documentation site:docs.claude.com"
"GitHub Actions workflow syntax site:docs.github.com"
"ShellCheck documentation site:shellcheck.net"
```

## Token Efficiency

### Why This Saves Tokens

**Context isolation:**
- Agent runs in isolated context
- Only returns final results to main conversation
- Doesn't include intermediate search results in main context
- Saves 30-40% tokens on research-heavy tasks

**Caching:**
- Results cached for 1 hour (default)
- Repeated queries use cache (no additional API calls)
- Cache hit rate tracked in analytics

**Structured output:**
- Agent formats results concisely
- Removes redundant information
- Focuses on actionable content

### Monitoring Token Savings

Check analytics to see token savings:

```bash
/gemini-search:search-stats
```

This shows:
- Total searches performed
- Cache hit rate
- Estimated token savings
- Top queries

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Control caching and behavior:

```bash
# Cache TTL (seconds)
export GEMINI_SEARCH_CACHE_TTL=3600  # 1 hour (default)

# Cache directory
export GEMINI_SEARCH_CACHE_DIR="/tmp/gemini-search-cache"

# Analytics directory
export GEMINI_ANALYTICS_DIR="/tmp/gemini-analytics"

# Enable debug logging
export DEBUG=true
```

### Cache Management

Clear cache if needed:

```bash
/gemini-search:clear-cache
```

This removes all cached search results and resets analytics.

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific in Queries

**Good:**
```
"GitHub Actions workflow syntax for release automation with semantic versioning 2025"
```

**Less effective:**
```
"GitHub Actions workflow"
```

### 2. Include Context

Provide context in your research prompts:

```
Research GitHub Actions workflow best practices for a Claude Code plugin repository.
Focus on:
- Shell script linting (ShellCheck)
- JSON validation
- Release automation with semantic versioning
- Security scanning

Include current (2025) best practices and working examples.
```

### 3. Leverage Caching

For repeated research on the same topic, rely on cached results to save time and tokens.

### 4. Verify Sources

Always check the source URLs provided by the agent to ensure information comes from:
- Official documentation
- Reputable technical sites
- Recent publications (prefer 2024-2025)

### 5. Combine with Local Knowledge

Use web research to supplement, not replace, local knowledge:
- Research when local docs are insufficient
- Verify current best practices
- Find recent changes or updates
- Discover new tools or patterns

## Examples

### Example 1: Research Claude Code Skills

```
Task tool parameters:
- subagent_type: "gemini-search:gemini-search"
- description: "Research Claude Code skills"
- prompt: "Search for comprehensive documentation about Claude Code skills.

  Focus on:
  1. What skills are and how they work
  2. Skill structure and YAML frontmatter format
  3. Best practices for skill creation
  4. Examples of well-designed skills
  5. Tool access restrictions with allowed-tools

  Please provide a structured summary with key points and official documentation URLs.

  Include current information from docs.claude.com."
```

### Example 2: Research GitHub Actions Best Practices

```
Task tool parameters:
- subagent_type: "gemini-search:gemini-search"
- description: "Research GitHub Actions CI/CD"
- prompt: "Research GitHub Actions CI/CD best practices for a shell script project.

  Include:
  1. Workflow structure and organization
  2. Matrix testing across platforms
  3. Caching strategies for dependencies
  4. Security scanning integration
  5. Release automation patterns

  Focus on 2025 best practices with working examples.

  Include information from docs.github.com and reputable sources."
```

### Example 3: Troubleshoot ShellCheck Issue

```
Task tool parameters:
- subagent_type: "gemini-search:gemini-search"
- description: "Research ShellCheck SC2086"
- prompt: "Research ShellCheck warning SC2086: 'Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting'.

  Find:
  1. What causes this warning
  2. Why it's important to fix
  3. Common fix patterns with examples
  4. Cases where it can be safely ignored

  Provide practical examples from shellcheck.net and trusted sources."
```

## Limitations

### When NOT to Use This Skill

**Don't use for:**
- Local file reading (use Read tool instead)
- Code analysis (use Grep/Glob tools)
- Local repository information (use Bash with git commands)
- Information already in context
- Very specific codebase questions (use local search first)

**Do use for:**
- Current best practices and standards
- Official documentation not in context
- Error message troubleshooting
- Tool comparisons and recommendations
- Recent updates or changes to tools
- Examples from the broader community

### Rate Limiting

The gemini-search agent uses the Gemini API which may have rate limits:
- Respect API limits
- Use caching to reduce API calls
- Space out multiple searches if needed
