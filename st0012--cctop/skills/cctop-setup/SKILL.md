# cctop Setup Skill

Helps install the cctop app required for session monitoring.

## When to Use

**Run installation guidance when:**
- Hook fails with "cctop-hook not found"
- User asks to set up cctop monitoring
- Session tracking is not working

## Installation

### Step 1: Check if cctop.app is installed

```bash
ls /Applications/cctop.app/Contents/MacOS/cctop-hook 2>/dev/null || ls ~/Applications/cctop.app/Contents/MacOS/cctop-hook 2>/dev/null
```

If not found, the user needs to install cctop.app.

### Step 2: Install cctop

**Option A: Homebrew (recommended)**
```bash
brew install --cask st0012/cctop/cctop
```

**Option B: Download from GitHub**
Download the latest release from https://github.com/st0012/cctop/releases/latest and move `cctop.app` to `/Applications/`.

### Step 3: Verify installation

```bash
/Applications/cctop.app/Contents/MacOS/cctop-hook --version
```

### Step 4: Launch the app

```bash
open /Applications/cctop.app
```

## After Installation

The hooks registered by this plugin will now work. Session data will be written to `~/.cctop/sessions/` when Claude Code hooks fire.

The menubar app will show session status in the macOS menu bar.
