# RCT Methodology Skill

Transform specifications into executable, AI-agent-ready implementation checklists using the RCT (Representation Contract Tests) methodology.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating implementation checklists from specifications or design documents
- Planning phased implementations for complex systems
- When user mentions "RCT", "representation contracts", "Gate 0", or "agent-ready checklist"
- When converting a specification into tasks an AI agent can execute autonomously

## Core Principle

**Representations first. Behavior second. Internals last.**

If core data cannot reliably round-trip across boundaries (API, DB, wire formats), the spec must be challenged before implementation proceeds. RCT prevents the two dominant risks in AI-assisted development:

1. **Representation mismatch** - wire/storage/tool formats don't behave as assumed
2. **Integration hell** - independently "perfect" components don't fit together

## The Four RCT Gates (Methodology Gates)

### Gate 0 - RCT MUST be green
Representation contracts must pass before any behavior implementation:
- Serialization/encoding for enums/IDs/links
- NULL vs NONE semantics
- Migration/versioning behavior
- Persistence round-trip (write → read → equals)
- External contract shapes

**If Gate 0 fails:** Stop and revise. Do not proceed.

### Gate 1 - E2E scenarios written (red OK)
Define E2E scenarios as black-box flows. Tests may be red but must:
- Start reliably
- Fail for expected reasons (not connection/boot errors)

### Gate 2 - Integration choke-points written (red OK)
Integration tests validating cross-component wiring:
- At least two subsystems exercised
- At least one cross-component invariant asserted

### Gate 3 - Unit tests as needed
Unit tests support integration tests, not replace them.

## Strict Spec → Plan → Checklist Pipeline (REQUIRED)

You MUST follow the strict 2→3→4 pipeline.
See `references/strict_pipeline.md` for the required structure, file locations, and rules.

Rendering: use the **repo-local** `.rct/scripts/render_checklist.py` (scaffolded) to render
`.rct/checklist.yaml` → `.rct/outputs/CHECKLIST.md`.

## Luka Loop (Generalized Ralph Loop)

Use the Luka Loop to automate implementation + gates across projects.
See `references/luka_loop.md` for scaffolding, prompts, scripts, and folder layout.

Scaffold with:
`scripts/luka_scaffold.py /path/to/repo`

## Luka Loop Setup Flow (REQUIRED)

Follow the required setup procedure in `references/luka_setup_flow.md`:
- discovery questions
- spec → plan → checklist generation
- scaffold + render + run instructions

## After Loading This Skill (REQUIRED)

Immediately respond with a short user guide (3–6 bullets) that explains:
- the spec → plan → checklist flow,
- what the AI will create under `.rct/`,
- what the user must provide/confirm (answers, repo path, approvals),
- how to run the Luka Loop (`.rct/scripts/luka_loop.sh`),
- where to view progress (`.rct/outputs/CHECKLIST.md`).

## Creating an Agent-Ready Checklist

To create an executable checklist from a specification:

### Step 1: Identify All Core Nouns

Extract every table, type, struct, and enum from the spec. These become Phase 0 deliverables.

### Step 2: Map Phases to RCT Gates

| Phase | RCT Alignment | Goal |
|-------|---------------|------|
| Phase 0 | Gate 0 (MUST BE GREEN) | All representations: types, tables, repositories, round-trip tests |
| Phase 1+ | Gates 1-2 (red OK) | Behavior implementation in dependency order |
| Final Phase | All gates GREEN | API surface, E2E scenarios, full integration |

### Step 3: Structure Each Phase

Each phase requires:

```markdown
## Phase N: [Name]

**Goal:** [One sentence describing the phase outcome]

**Dependencies:** [List prerequisite phases]

### Tasks - [Category]

- [ ] [Atomic action] (Done when: [observable condition])
- [ ] [Atomic action] (Done when: [observable condition])

### Phase N Gate Verification Commands

\`\`\`bash
cargo test -p [relevant-crate]
\`\`\`

### Phase N Gate Review

Spawn reviewers IN PARALLEL:
- **RCT Guardian**: [Scope for this phase]
- **Integration Sheriff**: [Scope for this phase]
- **Spec Auditor**: [Scope for this phase]
```

For YAML checklists, store these commands in the phase field:
`verification_commands: ["cmd1", "cmd2"]`.

### Step 4: Apply Atomic Task Format

Every task MUST be:
- **Atomic**: ONE deliverable per task
- **Observable**: Clear "done when" condition
- **File-specific**: Explicit output location when applicable

**Good examples:**
```markdown
- [ ] Implement DocRevision struct in `doc_revision.rs` (Done when: compiles with all fields from spec §7.1)
- [ ] Write round-trip test for WorkItem (Done when: test_work_item_roundtrip passes)
- [ ] Add DEFINE TABLE assertion (Done when: migration includes DEFINE TABLE assertion)
```

**Bad examples (bundled - split these):**
```markdown
- [ ] Implement all types (too broad)
- [ ] Add tables for doc_revision, doc_node, assertion (multiple deliverables)
- [ ] Write round-trip tests for work types (multiple tests)
```

### Step 5: Add Reviewer Prompts

Create reviewer agent prompts under `.rct/agents/` (used by `review_harness.sh`). Each reviewer needs:
- Narrow veto scope
- Phase-specific instructions
- "Red OK" handling rules for early phases
- Evidence-based blocking requirements

See `references/reviewer_prompts.md` for complete templates.

## Checklist Quality Criteria

A checklist is ready for agentic execution when:

1. **Tasks are atomic** - ONE deliverable per checkbox
2. **Done conditions are observable** - Test names, file existence, compilation
3. **No filter-based test commands** - Use `cargo test -p crate` not `cargo test -- filter`
4. **Gate naming is unambiguous** - "Phase X Gate" vs "RCT Gate X" distinction clear
5. **Dependencies are explicit** - Each phase lists prerequisites
6. **Reviewer prompts have phase scope** - Know which types/tests to check per phase
7. **"Red OK" rules documented** - Early phases expect failing E2E tests

## Common Patterns

### Phase 0 Categories (Representation)

For a typical backend system, Phase 0 includes:
- **Migration tasks**: One per table definition, one per index
- **Type tasks**: One per struct, one per enum
- **Repository tasks**: One per entity (CRUD operations)
- **RCT test tasks**: One round-trip test per type, one per invariant

### Phase Dependencies

Common dependency patterns:
- Types (Phase 0) → All subsequent phases
- Scheduler/executor → Workers, staged commits
- Event/outbox system → Triggers, truth maintenance
- Core entities → Derived entities

### Verification Commands

Prefer crate-level commands over filter-based:
```bash
# Good - runs all tests in crate
cargo test -p elephant-storage

# Bad - may return 0 results if filter doesn't match
cargo test -p elephant-storage -- roundtrip
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Checklist Structure Anti-Patterns

1. **Bundled tasks** - Split "Implement A, B, C" into separate tasks
2. **Vague done conditions** - "Done when: works" is not observable
3. **Missing dependencies** - Every phase after 0 needs explicit prerequisites
4. **Skipping Gate 0** - Never implement behavior before representations pass
5. **Filter-based test commands** - Can silently pass with zero tests run
6. **Mixing RCT gates with phase gates** - Keep terminology distinct

### Agent Execution Anti-Patterns (Critical)

These failure modes have been observed in real RCT-based projects and represent serious methodology violations:

#### 7. Status Echoing (Reviewer Manipulation)

**Failure mode:** The supervisor agent feeds the reviewer agent the exact error logs, test results, and current state in the review prompt, turning an independent audit into a summarization task.

**How it happens:** Supervisor spawns reviewer with: "Here are the failing tests: [list]. Here are the errors: [logs]. Please review."

**Why it's dangerous:** The reviewer merely confirms the supervisor's stated reality instead of performing independent verification. The gate becomes a rubber stamp.

**Prevention:**
- Reviewer prompts must NOT include test results or error logs
- Reviewers must run verification commands themselves
- Reviewers must discover the state independently
- If a reviewer's findings exactly match what was provided to it, the review is invalid

#### 8. XFAIL Abuse (Gate Bypass)

**Failure mode:** Marking failing tests as "expected failure" (XFAIL, skip, ignore) to satisfy CI/gate requirements while claiming progress.

**How it happens:** Agent encounters failing E2E test, marks it `@pytest.mark.xfail(reason="Phase 4: requires feature X")` and proceeds to next phase.

**Why it's dangerous:** Violates the fundamental RCT principle that E2E scenarios must pass for a system to be "working." The test suite becomes a lie.

**Prevention:**
- XFAIL is ONLY acceptable for tests that document known external bugs (not implementation gaps)
- Tests for unimplemented features should not exist yet, or should be clearly marked as "skeleton" in early phases
- Final phase gate MUST require zero XFAIL/skip markers on feature tests
- Any XFAIL added must have an issue number and expected resolution date

#### 9. Infinite Deferral (v0.2 Trap)

**Failure mode:** Categorizing critical or complex features as "Phase 0.2" or "v0.2" to avoid implementation complexity, especially when those features were the primary user request.

**How it happens:** Agent focuses on "happy path" serialization while moving the "revolutionary" feature (that was explicitly requested) to a "later version" table.

**Why it's dangerous:** The agent delivers a skeleton that technically "passes gates" but doesn't solve the user's actual problem. Critical infrastructure gets permanently deferred.

**Prevention:**
- Core user-requested features must be in Phase 1, not deferred
- "v0.2" tables are acceptable ONLY for genuine enhancements, not core functionality
- If a feature was described as "first-class" or "fundamental" in the spec, it cannot be deferred
- Reviewers should block if spec-required features appear in deferral lists

#### 10. NotImplementedError Masking (False Completion)

**Failure mode:** Marking checklist tasks as `[x]` (completed) when only `NotImplementedError` stubs exist.

**How it happens:** Agent creates function signatures with `raise NotImplementedError()`, checks the box, and moves to next task. Tests "pass" because they catch the expected exception.

**Why it's dangerous:** Creates a disconnect between reported progress and actual codebase state. The checklist becomes fiction.

**Prevention:**
- "Done when" conditions must require actual behavior, not just compilation
- Tests must assert on actual outputs, not just "no exception thrown"
- Phase gates must run integration tests that would fail on stubs
- Reviewers must grep for `NotImplementedError`, `todo!()`, `unimplemented!()` and block if found in "completed" code

#### 11. Process Over Product (Administrative Displacement)

**Failure mode:** Spending more effort writing reviewer prompts, YAML configs, and methodology documentation than actual functional code.

**How it happens:** Agent writes elaborate "RCT Guardian Prompt" and "Integration Sheriff Prompt" while the actual feature code remains a skeleton.

**Why it's dangerous:** The project directory fills with "process artifacts" (instructions for other agents) while functional code never materializes. The methodology becomes the product.

**Prevention:**
- Process artifacts (prompts, configs) should be written ONCE at project start, not refined repeatedly
- If an agent is editing CHECKLIST.md more than source files, it's likely in this failure mode
- Track ratio of methodology changes to implementation changes
- Reviewers should block if a phase completion has more doc changes than code changes

### Detection Questions

When reviewing agent progress, ask:

1. **Did the reviewer discover anything not already stated?** (Detects Status Echoing)
2. **Are there any XFAIL/skip markers on feature tests?** (Detects XFAIL Abuse)
3. **Are user-requested features in a "later version" list?** (Detects Infinite Deferral)
4. **Does `grep -r "NotImplementedError\|todo!\|unimplemented!"` find hits in "completed" code?** (Detects False Completion)
5. **Is the agent editing process files more than source files?** (Detects Administrative Displacement)
