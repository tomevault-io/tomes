# Context Engineering

Design effective prompts and optimize the full context window for AI models and agents to produce consistently high-quality output.

## Quick Start

### Recipe 1: Improve a vague prompt

**Before:** `Review this code and give feedback.`

**After:**
```xml
<task>Review the provided code for correctness, performance, and maintainability.</task>
<output-format>
For each issue: file/line, severity (critical|warning|suggestion), problem (one sentence), fix (concrete code change).
If no issues, state "No issues found" and list one strength.
</output-format>
<code>{{code_to_review}}</code>
```

**Why it works:** Specifies evaluation criteria, defines output structure, separates instructions from data with XML tags.

### Recipe 2: Design a system prompt

Use the **altitude concept** -- not so high it's useless ("be helpful"), not so low it's brittle ("always use 4 spaces").

1. **Define the role** in one sentence: what the agent IS and IS NOT
2. **Set altitude** -- right level: "Follow the project's existing naming conventions. When none exists, prefer descriptive names over short ones."
3. **Add constraints** using RFC 2119 language (MUST, SHOULD, MAY)
4. **Include 1-2 canonical examples** of ideal output
5. **Define non-goals** to prevent scope creep

See `references/system-prompt-design.md` for full anatomy and templates.

### Recipe 3: Structure agent context with the 4 strategies

When your agent produces inconsistent or degraded output, apply the four strategies:

| Strategy | Action | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Write** | Craft persistent instructions | System prompt with altitude-appropriate rules |
| **Select** | Choose what enters context | Use `oak_search` to retrieve only relevant code |
| **Compress** | Reduce tokens, preserve signal | Summarize prior conversation turns, delegate to sub-agents |
| **Isolate** | Move information out of context | Store reference docs externally, load just-in-time |

```
1. Start with Write: define a clear system prompt
2. Apply Select: give the agent only the tools and context it needs
3. Add Compress: implement compaction for long sessions
4. Use Isolate: move large reference material behind retrieval
```

See `references/context-engineering-framework.md` for the full framework.

## The Evolution: Prompt to Context Engineering

| Level | Focus | Scope | Key Insight |
|-------|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Basic Prompting** | The question you type | Single user message | Clarity matters |
| **Prompt Engineering** | Crafting effective prompts | Prompt + examples + structure | Technique amplifies quality |
| **Context Engineering** | Everything the model sees | System prompt + tools + memory + retrieved docs + conversation history | The context window IS the product |

Context engineering manages **everything** the model sees -- system prompt, tools, retrieved documents, conversation history, and memory. Every token either helps or hurts. The entire context window is a design surface.

## Prompt Engineering Foundations

These eight techniques form the foundation. Master them before moving to context engineering.

| # | Technique | When to Use | Key Rule |
|---|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | **Be clear and direct** | Always -- this is the baseline | State exactly what you want; remove ambiguity |
| 2 | **Use examples (multishot)** | Output format matters, or the task is nuanced | Show 2-3 examples of ideal input/output pairs |
| 3 | **Chain of thought** | Reasoning, math, multi-step logic | Ask the model to think step-by-step before answering |
| 4 | **Use XML tags** | Separating instructions from data, structured output | Wrap distinct sections in descriptive tags like `<context>`, `<instructions>` |
| 5 | **Give Claude a role** | Specialized tasks needing domain expertise | Set the role in the system prompt, not the user message |
| 6 | **Chain complex prompts** | Multi-step workflows, pipelines | Break into sequential steps; output of step N feeds step N+1 |
| 7 | **Long context tips** | Large documents, many files | Put key instructions at top and bottom; use XML to delineate sections |
| 8 | **Extended thinking** | Complex reasoning, planning, self-correction | Enable thinking to let the model plan before responding |

**Combining techniques:** Most effective prompts use 3-5 techniques together. A code review prompt might combine clarity (#1), XML structure (#4), role (#5), and examples (#2).

See `references/prompt-foundations.md` for detailed explanations, examples, and anti-patterns for each technique.

## Context Engineering Framework (4 Strategies)

### Write: Craft the persistent context

The Write strategy covers everything you author in advance: system prompts, tool descriptions, and instruction files. This is the context you control completely.

**The altitude concept** is the most important principle. Your instructions need to be at the right level of abstraction:

| Altitude | Example | Problem |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Too high | "Write clean code" | No actionable guidance -- the agent fills in its own interpretation |
| Too low | "Always use `Array.prototype.reduce` for aggregation" | Brittle -- breaks when context changes, prevents good judgment |
| Right | "Prefer declarative patterns over imperative loops. Choose the array method that most clearly expresses intent." | Guides without constraining |

**Canonical examples** are powerful -- a single well-chosen example communicates more than paragraphs of rules:

```xml
<system>
You generate API documentation from source code.
<example>
<input>
def calculate_tax(amount: float, rate: float = 0.08) -> float:
    """Calculate sales tax for a given amount."""
    return round(amount * rate, 2)
</input>
<output>
### `calculate_tax(amount, rate=0.08)`
Calculate sales tax for a given amount.
- `amount` (float): The pre-tax amount
- `rate` (float, optional): Tax rate as decimal. Default: 0.08
- **Returns:** float -- Tax amount, rounded to 2 decimal places.
</output>
</example>
</system>
```

**Project-level Write strategy:** Use the `/project-governance` skill to create a constitution (`oak/constitution.md`) and agent instruction files. Your constitution IS your project-level system prompt. The altitude concept applies directly: "write good code" is useless; "copy `src/features/auth/service.py` for new services" is actionable.

See `references/context-engineering-framework.md` for the full Write strategy guide.

### Select: Choose what enters the context window

Select the right information to include; keep everything else out.

**For tools:** Provide the **minimal viable toolset** (unused tools cause confusion), write **unambiguous descriptions** (the model uses these to decide when to call), and prefer **specific tools** over general-purpose ones.

**For retrieved context:** Quality over quantity (3 relevant snippets beat 20 loose ones), recency matters, and always include source attribution (file paths, line numbers).

**Anti-pattern -- context stuffing:**
```
# Bad: dumping everything "just in case"
context = all_docs + all_code + all_history + all_memories
# Good: selecting what's relevant
context = search_relevant_code(task) + get_recent_decisions(task)
```

### Compress: Reduce tokens while preserving information

Compress rather than truncate. Preserve signal while reducing cost.

**Strategies:** Conversation summarization (replace old turns with structured summary), note-taking scratchpad (running notes vs. re-reading history), sub-agent delegation (offload research, return only findings), and tool result cleanup (extract then clear verbose output).

**When to compress:** Context exceeds 50% capacity, agent forgets earlier instructions, responses repeat or lose focus, or tool results contain mostly irrelevant data.

### Isolate: Move information out of the main context

Store information externally and load just-in-time, rather than keeping it in context at all times.

**Patterns:** Just-in-time retrieval (load docs only when needed), progressive disclosure (summary first, details on demand), hybrid context loading (rules in system prompt, reference material behind search), and memory-as-a-tool (store externally, retrieve on demand).

**Progressive disclosure example:** Agent sees summary ("Auth uses JWT") -> needs details (retrieves auth docs) -> needs code (retrieves auth service file). Each step loads only what's needed.

See `references/context-engineering-framework.md` for the complete framework with extended examples.

## Agent Context Patterns

### Sessions vs memory

| Concept | Scope | Lifetime | Purpose |
|---------|-------|----------|---------|
| **Session** | Single conversation | Ephemeral | Working memory for the current task |
| **Memory** | Cross-session | Persistent | Accumulated knowledge and learnings |

The common mistake: keeping everything in the session instead of writing important things to persistent memory.

### Context rot

Output quality degrades as conversations grow longer due to: **dilution** (instructions buried under tool results), **position bias** (models attend more to beginning/end, losing middle), **contradiction accumulation**, and **working memory overflow**.

**Signs:** Agent forgets earlier constraints, responses become generic/repetitive, re-asks answered questions, quality drops vs. early turns.

**Mitigation:** Apply Compress (summarize and compact) and Isolate (move reference material behind retrieval). For long-running agents, implement periodic compaction checkpoints.

### Memory types

| Type | What It Stores | Example | OAK CI Tool |
|------|---------------|---------|-------------|
| **Episodic** | What happened | "Refactored auth module in session #42" | `oak_search --type memory` |
| **Procedural** | How to do things | "To add a feature, copy the strategic_planning exemplar" | `oak_remember` with type `discovery` |
| **Semantic** | Facts and concepts | "The API uses JWT tokens with 1-hour expiry" | `oak_remember` with type `discovery` |

### Memory-as-a-tool pattern

Store externally, retrieve on demand -- instead of accumulating in context:

```
1. Discover → oak_remember("auth tokens expire after 1 hour", type="discovery")
2. Later   → oak_search("auth token expiry") retrieves just-in-time
3. Stale   → oak_resolve_memory(id, status="resolved") cleans up
```

This implements both Compress (don't hold everything) and Isolate (retrieve when needed).

### Compaction strategies

| Strategy | How It Works | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Last-N** | Keep only the last N conversation turns | Simple, predictable token budget |
| **Recursive summarization** | Summarize old turns, keep recent ones verbatim | Long conversations with important early context |
| **Hybrid** | Summarize + keep pinned messages (system prompt, key decisions) | Complex agents with critical persistent instructions |

See `references/agent-context-patterns.md` and `references/memory-and-sessions.md` for detailed patterns and implementation guidance.

## CI Integration: Context Engineering in Practice

OAK's Team tools directly implement the four context engineering strategies:

| Strategy | CI Tool | What It Does |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Write** | `oak_remember` / `{oak-cli-command} ci remember` | Persist learnings, decisions, and gotchas to long-term memory |
| **Select** | `oak_search` / `{oak-cli-command} ci search` | Retrieve only the code and memories relevant to the current task |
| **Isolate** | `oak_context` / `{oak-cli-command} ci context` | Assemble just-in-time context for a specific task, pulling from code and memory |
| **Consolidate** | `oak_resolve_memory` / `{oak-cli-command} ci resolve` | Resolve stale observations to prevent context rot in the memory store |

### Example workflow

```bash
# WRITE: Store a discovery for future sessions
{oak-cli-command} ci remember "Payment service retries 3x with exponential backoff" --type discovery
# SELECT: Find relevant code for a task
{oak-cli-command} ci search "payment retry logic" --type code -n 5
# ISOLATE: Assemble just-in-time context
{oak-cli-command} ci context "fix payment timeout bug" -f src/services/payment.py
# CONSOLIDATE: Clean up after fixing
{oak-cli-command} ci resolve <memory-id>
```

## Before/After Gallery

### Vague prompt to structured prompt

**Before:** `Write tests for the user service.`

**After:**
```xml
<task>Write unit tests for UserService: create_user, get_user_by_email, delete_user.</task>
<constraints>
- pytest with fixtures for setup/teardown
- Test success and error paths for each method
- Mock external API calls (email verification)
- Descriptive test names: test_create_user_with_duplicate_email_raises_conflict
</constraints>
```

### Bloated system prompt to altitude-optimized

**Before** (micromanaging): "Always use f-strings. Always use pathlib. Always use type hints. Use black with line length 88. Use dataclasses for DTOs. Never use print()..."

**After** (right altitude):
```xml
<role>You are a Python developer working in this project.</role>
<principles>
- Follow existing patterns. Find the closest implementation and mirror its style.
- Prefer modern Python (3.10+). When in doubt, check what the codebase uses.
- Write code that reads clearly without comments. Comment only non-obvious "why" decisions.
</principles>
<quality>Run `make check` before considering any change complete.</quality>
```

### Context-stuffed agent to compress + isolate

**Before:** 40,000 tokens (2K rules + 3K README + 8K tool descriptions + 12K API docs + 15K conversation = half irrelevant)

**After:** 8,000 tokens (800 altitude-optimized prompt + 1,200 for 5 relevant tools + 2,000 retrieved context + 4,000 compressed conversation = all relevant)

See `references/before-after-examples.md` for the full gallery with additional transformations.
