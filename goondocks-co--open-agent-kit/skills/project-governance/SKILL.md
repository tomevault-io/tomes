# Project Governance

Create, modify, and maintain project constitutions and agent instruction files that guide AI agents. Also supports RFC/ADR documents for formalizing technical decisions.

## Quick Start

### Create a constitution

```bash
# Analyze the project, then create oak/constitution.md
# See references/constitution-guide.md for the full process
```

### Create agent instruction files

```bash
{oak-cli-command} rules detect-existing      # Discover all configured agent instruction files
{oak-cli-command} rules sync-agents          # Sync constitution references to all agent files
```

## Commands Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `{oak-cli-command} rules detect-existing` | Discover all configured agent instruction files |
| `{oak-cli-command} rules detect-existing --json` | Machine-readable output of agent files |
| `{oak-cli-command} rules sync-agents` | Sync constitution references to all agent instruction files |
| `{oak-cli-command} rules sync-agents --dry-run` | Preview what files will be checked/updated |

## When to Use

- **Creating a new constitution** for a project that doesn't have one
- **Creating agent instruction files** for a new project (use `{oak-cli-command} rules detect-existing` to discover correct file names)
- **Adding rules** when you identify patterns that should be standardized
- **Syncing agent files** after constitution changes
- **Learning context engineering theory** behind effective rule writing -- see `/context-engineering` for the altitude concept, canonical examples, and structured context patterns

## Constitution Structure

A good constitution is **explicit, enforceable, and anchored**:

| Quality | Good | Bad |
|---------|------|-----|
| Specificity | "All API endpoints MUST validate input using Pydantic models" | "Use best practices" |
| Anchors | "Copy `src/features/auth/service.py` for new services" | "Follow good patterns" |
| Non-goals | "This tool is NOT a CI/CD orchestrator" | (no boundaries) |
| Gates | "`make check` must pass for all changes" | "Add tests if needed" |

Required sections: Metadata, Scope and Non-Goals, Golden Paths with Anchor Index, Architecture Invariants, No-Magic-Literals, CLI Behavior, Quality Gates. See `references/constitution-guide.md` for the full structure and creation process.

## Key Workflows

### Creating agent instruction files

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT guess agent file names. Always discover them dynamically.

1. **Discover** the correct file names and paths: `{oak-cli-command} rules detect-existing`
2. **Read** the output — it shows each configured agent, the expected file path, and whether the file already exists
3. **Create** only the files listed as "not found", using the exact paths from the output
4. **Content** should follow the template in `references/agent-file-good-example.md`
5. **Verify** all files are detected: `{oak-cli-command} rules detect-existing` (all should show ✓)

### Adding a rule to an existing constitution

1. **Read** the current constitution (`oak/constitution.md`)
2. **Add** the full rule to the appropriate section using RFC 2119 language (MUST, SHOULD, MAY)
3. **Sync** to all agent files: `{oak-cli-command} rules sync-agents`

**CRITICAL:** Rules MUST be added to the constitution FIRST, then synced to agent files. Never add a rule only to an agent file.

## Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| "Use best practices" | Not enforceable | Specify the practice |
| "When possible" | Loophole generator | Define when it's required |
| No anchors | Agents freestyle | Point to specific files |
| No non-goals | Scope creep | Explicitly exclude things |
| "Add tests if needed" | Permission to skip | Define coverage requirements |
| "Make reasonable assumptions" | Inconsistent patterns | Say "ask if uncertain" |

## Files

- Constitution: `oak/constitution.md` or `.constitution.md`
- Agent files: Run `{oak-cli-command} rules detect-existing` to discover all agent instruction files
- RFCs: `oak/rfc/RFC-XXX-short-title.md`

## Deep Dives

For detailed guidance, consult the reference documents:

### Constitution & Agent Files
- **`references/constitution-guide.md`** — Full constitution creation process and structure
- **`references/constitution-good-example.md`** — Complete example of a well-structured constitution
- **`references/constitution-bad-example.md`** — Anti-patterns to avoid
- **`references/agent-files-guide.md`** — Creating and syncing agent instruction files
- **`references/agent-file-good-example.md`** — Well-structured agent file example
- **`references/agent-file-bad-example.md`** — Poorly structured agent file example

### RFCs (secondary)
- **`references/creating-rfcs.md`** — Detailed RFC creation workflow
- **`references/reviewing-rfcs.md`** — RFC review checklist and feedback format

## RFC Support

RFCs formalize technical decisions that may eventually become constitution rules. This is a secondary capability — see the dedicated references for full details.

### RFC commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `{oak-cli-command} rfc create --title "..." --template <type>` | Create a new RFC |
| `{oak-cli-command} rfc list` | List all RFCs |
| `{oak-cli-command} rfc validate <path>` | Validate RFC structure and content |
| `{oak-cli-command} rfc show <path>` | Show RFC details |
| `{oak-cli-command} rfc adopt <path>` | Mark RFC as adopted |
| `{oak-cli-command} rfc abandon <path> --reason "..."` | Mark RFC as abandoned |

### RFC templates

| Template | Use For |
|----------|---------|
| `feature` | New features, capabilities |
| `architecture` | System architecture changes |
| `engineering` | Development practices, tooling |
| `process` | Team processes, workflows |

### RFC lifecycle

1. **Create**: `{oak-cli-command} rfc create --title "..." --template feature --author "Name"`
2. **Fill in**: Problem context, proposed solution, trade-offs, alternatives
3. **Review**: Use the review checklist (see `references/reviewing-rfcs.md`)
4. **Adopt or abandon**: `{oak-cli-command} rfc adopt <path>` or `{oak-cli-command} rfc abandon <path> --reason "..."`

### RFC review checklist (summary)

- Structure: Clear title, correct status, all required sections
- Context: Problem clearly stated, "why now?" addressed, scope defined
- Decision: Solution clear, technical approach explained
- Consequences: Positive/negative outcomes listed, mitigations proposed
- Alternatives: Other options considered, reasons for rejection explained
