# Background Terminals

Use `bg_start` for long-running commands; use regular `bash` for quick commands.

## Start

Call `bg_start` with:

- `command`: shell command to run
- `title`: short recognizable label
- `working_dir`: project directory when different from the current directory
- `timeout_seconds`: optional deadline for finite work such as builds, tests, or migrations; omit for servers and watchers

Background commands receive no stdin. Never use them for interactive prompts.

After starting, continue useful work instead of polling. The terminal sends one completion message when it exits or times out.

## Inspect and stop

- Use `bg_status` only when current output or status is needed.
- Use `bg_list` to inventory all tracked terminals.
- Use `bg_kill` when a process is no longer needed or is stuck; termination continues even if the tool wait is aborted.
- Tell the user they can open `/ps` to inspect live output and kill terminals interactively.

Prefer meaningful titles and avoid starting duplicate servers or watchers. Full output is captured to spill files; tool and completion output shows a concise tail. Terminals are session-scoped and are stopped during shutdown or reload.
