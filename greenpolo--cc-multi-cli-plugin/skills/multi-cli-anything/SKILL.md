# Add a new CLI to cc-multi-cli-plugin

cc-multi-cli-plugin is a **multi-plugin marketplace**. Adding a new CLI means adding a new plugin to the marketplace plus wiring a new adapter into the shared companion runtime in the `multi` plugin.

## Step 0 — Research the CLI first

Before writing any code, pull everything you need to know about the CLI so you don't have to guess or ask the user later. Extract:

- **Install status and binary name** — is the user's machine set up? What's the exact command (`cursor-agent`? `agent`? `qwen`? `aider`?)
- **Structured transport** — does it support ACP, ASP, or structured stdout? (See prerequisites below.)
- **Exact model identifiers** the CLI accepts (or `auto` if offered). Hardcoding a wrong model string causes 400 errors at runtime.
- **Available slash commands and modes** — e.g., `/research`, `/review`, `/plan`, `/debug`, `/ask`, or whatever the CLI exposes. These determine which roles you'll map to slash-command prefixes in `buildPrompt()`.
- **Runtime flags** — sandbox, read-only, effort, background, resume — what does the CLI's `--help` actually use?
- **Authentication mechanism** — env var, OAuth, device code, API key header, etc.
- **Known quirks** (Windows shell requirements, PATH issues, version-specific behavior).

**Pick sources proportional to the question.** Do NOT run every source for every fact. Start cheap and authoritative; escalate only if unclear.

### First: search for an existing Claude Code integration of this CLI

Before doing anything else, **search exa for an existing implementation**. The community has wired up many CLIs already (Cursor's ACP adapter, the Gemini plugin port, etc.) — finding one collapses days of trial-and-error into "read their adapter, adapt to our marketplace structure."

Useful queries (try in this order, stop when you find a working example):

```
<cli-name> claude code plugin
<cli-name> ACP adapter
<cli-name> claude-code marketplace
<cli-name> agent client protocol
<cli-name> @anthropic-ai claude
```

A reference implementation reveals things probes don't:

- **Spawn quirks** — does the CLI need `shell: true` on Windows? A specific env var to init?
- **ACP protocol completeness** — many "ACP-supporting" CLIs implement the protocol incompletely; an existing adapter shows what edge cases break.
- **Auth flow specifics** — env vars, token paths, OAuth dance details.
- **Model ID conventions** — version suffixes, deprecated aliases. (Gemini's `-preview` suffix trap is the canonical example.)
- **Schema-validation pitfalls** — does the CLI's config reject unknown keys? Strict-mode JSON?

If you find one:
1. Read its full adapter implementation. Note any "this CLI is weird about X" comments.
2. Note any pre-handshake config it requires (extra params in the `initialize` call, custom auth methods, etc.).
3. Cite the source in your file (NOTICE attribution, plus a comment in the new adapter).
4. Adapt — don't blindly copy. Our marketplace structure differs from theirs; the principles transfer, the file paths don't.

If you don't find one (or it's stale / not maintained), proceed with the verification ladder below. Looking is cheap; not looking is how you spend 4 hours debugging an ACP handshake that needed one specific param.

### Verification sources, in order of cost/authority

1. **`<cli> --help`, `<cli> models`, `<cli> about`** — fastest, no network, authoritative for "what does this binary accept right now."
2. **Prompt the CLI itself** (when no listing subcommand exists):
   ```bash
   <cli> -p "List the exact <thing> strings this CLI accepts. One per line."
   ```
3. **Vendor docs via context7** — `resolve-library-id` → `query-docs`. Good for canonical names and deprecation context.
4. **exa web search** — for changelogs, forum posts, obscure flags context7 doesn't have.
5. **CLI source on GitHub** — `config/models.ts` constants. Slowest; use only when 1–4 disagree or come up empty.

For a yes/no question ("does this CLI have ACP?") use source 1 or 3 and stop. For a canonical ID that gets hardcoded into files, use 1 plus 3 or 4 to cross-check — two sources is enough.

**Hard rules:**
- **Never ask one CLI about another CLI's features.** It hallucinates as badly as you would. A CLI is a source only for itself.
- **Preview-suffix trap:** Many CLIs qualify unstable IDs with a suffix (`-preview`, `-beta`, `-exp`). Don't hardcode the unsuffixed variant — it will 404 at runtime. Gemini 3.x IDs all end in `-preview`.
- **Resolving disagreements:** CLI wins for "does it work right now"; docs win for "should I use this."
- **Record the source you used** inline in your response so the user can catch a bad citation.
- **Check existing adapters** in `plugins/multi/scripts/lib/adapters/` as reference templates for the transport pattern you'll reuse.

Proceed without asking the user to confirm facts you can verify yourself.

## Prerequisites — confirm the CLI speaks a structured transport

Check in this order:

### 1. Does it support ACP (Agent Client Protocol)?

ACP is a cross-vendor standard. Check the CLI's `--help` output for:
- `--acp` flag (used by Gemini, Copilot)
- `acp` subcommand (used by Cursor)
- An `--stdio` or `--server` mode that outputs NDJSON/JSON-RPC

If yes, this is the easy path. Skip to "ACP integration" below.

### 2. Does it support ASP (App Server Protocol)?

ASP is OpenAI's flavor — HTTP + SSE, as used by Codex (`codex --app-server`). If the CLI has a similar flag, you can reuse much of the Codex adapter pattern.

### 3. Does it have a structured headless output mode?

Some CLIs have `-p` or `--print` modes with `--output-format=json` or similar. Not as rich as ACP/ASP but workable — wrap subprocess invocation and parse the JSON stream.

### 4. None of the above?

The CLI is probably not a good fit yet. Suggest filing a feature request upstream for ACP support.

## ACP integration (easiest path)

### Step 1 — Pick a short CLI name

Use the CLI's brand name, lowercased. E.g., `qwen`, `opencode`, `aider`. This becomes the `--cli <name>` flag value and the slash-command namespace.

### Step 2 — Create the adapter inside `multi`

Copy the canonical Cursor adapter as a template:

```bash
cp plugins/multi/scripts/lib/adapters/cursor.mjs plugins/multi/scripts/lib/adapters/<new-cli>.mjs
```

Edit the new file:

1. **Rename functions** from `*Cursor` to `*<NewCli>` (e.g., `runAcpPromptCursor` → `runAcpPromptQwen`).
2. **Update `buildPrompt(role, userTask)`** — map role names to slash-command prefixes the CLI understands.
3. **Update the CLI binary name / args.** ACP subcommand: `args: ["acp"]`. ACP flag: `args: ["--acp"]` or `["--acp", "--stdio"]`.
4. **Update the `adapter` export:**
   ```js
   export const adapter = {
     name: "<new-cli>",
     isAvailable: get<NewCli>Availability,
     isAuthenticated: get<NewCli>AuthStatus,
     invoke: runAcpPrompt<NewCli>,
     cancel: interruptAcpPrompt<NewCli>,
     getSession: undefined,
   };
   ```
5. Syntax-check: `node --check plugins/multi/scripts/lib/adapters/<new-cli>.mjs`.

### Step 3 — Register the adapter in the companion

Edit `plugins/multi/scripts/multi-cli-companion.mjs`:

1. Add import near the other adapter imports:
   ```js
   import * as <newCli> from "./lib/adapters/<new-cli>.mjs";
   ```
2. Extend `ADAPTERS`:
   ```js
   const ADAPTERS = { codex, gemini, cursor, copilot, <newCli> };
   ```
3. Extend `executeTaskRun`'s dispatch with an `else if (cli === "<new-cli>")` branch mirroring the cursor branch exactly, substituting `<newCli>.adapter.invoke(...)`.
4. Extend `buildTaskRunMetadata`'s label map so jobs get a CLI-specific title.
5. Syntax-check: `node --check plugins/multi/scripts/multi-cli-companion.mjs`.

### Step 3.5 — Verify ACP behavior empirically

ACP is a standard, but every CLI implements it slightly differently. The contract a CLI advertises in `--help` doesn't always match what its `acp` mode actually does. Before declaring the integration done, run a real prompt that exercises the tools the user will rely on (shell exec, file writes, MCP, web search) and watch the wire.

Set `ACP_TRACE=1` and check a real run end-to-end:

```bash
ACP_TRACE=1 node plugins/multi/scripts/multi-cli-companion.mjs task \
  --cli <new-cli> --role <role> --write \
  "Run \`echo hello\`, then write a file, then call an MCP tool."
```

Then look at stderr for incoming JSON-RPC traffic from the agent. The `[acp-trace] <- REQ <method>` lines tell you which client-side ACP methods the agent expects you to provide; `<- NOTIF session/update[<kind>]` lines show streaming progress.

Things to verify (don't have to be in order — just check whichever is relevant for what the user wants this CLI to do):

- **Permission gate.** Does the agent send `session/request_permission` over ACP, or does it gate tool use through some out-of-band mechanism (a config file, a flag, a pre-approval list)? If you see `tool_call_update` go to `in_progress` and never `completed` with no incoming REQs, it's almost always an out-of-band gate. (Cursor, for example, uses `~/.cursor/cli-config.json`'s `permissions.allow` array — see `ensureCursorAllowlist` in `cursor.mjs`.)
- **Terminal handling.** Some agents implement `terminal/*` RPCs themselves (just declare `clientCapabilities.terminal=true` in the handshake and `acp-client.mjs`'s `buildAutoApproveRequestHandler` services them). Others run terminals internally and skip ACP entirely. Watching for `<- REQ terminal/create` tells you which.
- **MCP wiring.** `session/new` accepts an `mcpServers` array, but some agents silently ignore it in ACP mode (Cursor staff has confirmed this for `agent acp`). If the agent reports your MCP tools as missing, see if the CLI has a per-CLI MCP config file (e.g. `~/.cursor/mcp.json`) you should populate instead.
- **Mode setting.** `session/set_mode` semantics vary: for Cursor, "agent" gives full tool access while "plan"/"ask" restrict it; for Gemini, the equivalent is `approvalMode: "yolo"` for max permissions. Try setting and not setting it during testing.
- **CLI-side flags.** A CLI's interactive `--yolo` / `--force` / `--approve-mcps` flags often **don't apply to ACP mode** — they're for the interactive REPL or `-p` print mode. Don't assume they're a fix; verify on the wire.
- **Version sensitivity.** The same CLI can change behavior across builds (e.g. Cursor 2026.04.14 → 2026.04.17 broke MCP tool use in ACP). If something works locally and breaks in the field, check version specifics.

**The Cursor adapter is the worked example for everything above.** When in doubt, read `plugins/multi/scripts/lib/adapters/cursor.mjs` end-to-end — it shows the full set of workarounds that actually shipped: handshake capability declaration, mode-setting per role, allowlist file injection, version-specific warnings, and spawn flags. Adapt the patterns that apply to the new CLI; not all of them will.

For straightforward CLIs (clean ACP impl, no out-of-band gates), most of the above will be no-ops and the basic adapter scaffold from Step 2 will just work. Don't add guards for problems the CLI doesn't have.

### Step 4 — Add subagents for each role

Create one subagent file per role in `plugins/multi/agents/<new-cli>-<role>.md`:

```markdown
---
name: <new-cli>-<role>
description: Use when the user asks for <role-appropriate tasks> via <NewCli>.
model: sonnet
tools: Bash
---

You are a thin forwarding wrapper around the cc-multi-cli-plugin companion runtime for <NewCli>.

Use exactly one `Bash` call:
  `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/multi-cli-companion.mjs" task --cli <new-cli> --role <role> ...`

Preserve task text verbatim. Return stdout exactly. No commentary.
```

Subagent names are `<cli>-<role>` (e.g., `qwen-writer`). Invocation path: `subagent_type: "multi:<cli>-<role>"`.

### Step 5 — Create the new plugin directory

```bash
mkdir -p plugins/<new-cli>/.claude-plugin plugins/<new-cli>/commands
```

Write `plugins/<new-cli>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "<new-cli>",
  "description": "Delegate <roles> to <NewCli> CLI. Part of cc-multi-cli-plugin. Requires the `multi` plugin.",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "author": { "name": "greenpolo", "url": "https://github.com/greenpolo" },
  "license": "Apache-2.0",
  "keywords": ["claude-code", "<new-cli>", "<role>", "acp"]
}
```

### Step 6 — Write command files

One markdown per role in `plugins/<new-cli>/commands/<role>.md`:

```markdown
---
description: <what this does>
argument-hint: "[--model <model>] <what to do>"
allowed-tools: Bash(node:*), AskUserQuestion, Agent
---

Dispatch to the `multi:<new-cli>-<role>` subagent via the `Agent` tool.

Raw user request:
$ARGUMENTS

Return the subagent's output verbatim.
```

Command filename becomes the part after the colon in the slash: `plugins/qwen/commands/write.md` → `/qwen:write`.

### Step 7 — Register the new plugin in the marketplace

Edit `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (at the repo root) and add a new entry to the `plugins` array:

```json
{
  "name": "<new-cli>",
  "description": "Adds /<new-cli>:<roles>. Requires multi.",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "author": { "name": "greenpolo" },
  "source": "./plugins/<new-cli>"
}
```

Validate: `claude plugin validate <repo-root>` should pass.

### Step 8 — Install and test

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update cc-multi-cli-plugin
claude plugin install <new-cli>@cc-multi-cli-plugin
claude plugin install multi@cc-multi-cli-plugin --force   # pick up new subagent files
```

Restart Claude Code. Try `/<new-cli>:<role> <prompt>`.

## ASP integration (medium difficulty)

ASP requires a different transport (HTTP + SSE vs stdio JSON-RPC). If the new CLI uses ASP-style servers:

1. Study `plugins/multi/scripts/lib/app-server.mjs` and `plugins/multi/scripts/lib/adapters/codex.mjs`.
2. Model the new adapter on `codex.mjs` instead of `cursor.mjs`.
3. Steps 3–8 above still apply — the `ADAPTERS` registration and plugin scaffolding are protocol-agnostic.

This is more code than ACP integration — only take this path if the new CLI genuinely requires it.

## Subprocess + stream-json integration (fallback)

If the CLI lacks ACP/ASP but has a headless JSON-output mode, write an adapter that:
1. Spawns the CLI with `-p --output-format=json` (or equivalent).
2. Parses the JSON stream or final output.
3. Normalizes to the same result shape as other adapters: `{ sessionId, text, fileChanges, error }`.

The `adapter` export interface (`name`, `isAvailable`, `invoke`, etc.) stays identical — only the transport differs.

## Tested examples

OpenCode has been tested successfully via ACP. Qwen and Aider have similar ACP support and should work the same way. Any CLI that speaks a structured protocol is a candidate.

## Things NOT to change when adding a new CLI

- `plugins/multi/scripts/lib/acp-client.mjs`, `job-control.mjs`, `state.mjs`, `render.mjs` — shared infrastructure.
- `plugins/multi/scripts/lib/adapters/codex.mjs`, `gemini.mjs`, `cursor.mjs`, `copilot.mjs` — existing adapters.
- `plugins/multi/hooks/hooks.json` — unless the new CLI specifically needs a hook.

## Closing

After adding a new CLI, consider contributing the adapter back upstream. The plugin welcomes new CLIs that demonstrate working adapters — it's part of why the architecture is modular.
