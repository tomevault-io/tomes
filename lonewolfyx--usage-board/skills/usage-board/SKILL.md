# Code Convergence and Abstraction Boundary

Use this skill for any code implementation, refactor, cleanup, or review in this repository where duplication, abstraction boundaries, naming convergence, shared logic, or architectural shape are involved.

## Reference Map

Always read [references/00-goals-principles.md](references/00-goals-principles.md), [references/01-convergence-triggers.md](references/01-convergence-triggers.md), and [references/02-non-convergence-exceptions.md](references/02-non-convergence-exceptions.md) first. Then read every reference file that matches the files or behavior being changed.

Read all reference files for broad refactors, cleanup work, code reviews, or changes that cross module boundaries.

Core decision files:

- [references/00-goals-principles.md](references/00-goals-principles.md): goals, principles, abstraction value, and one-trusted-entry expectations.
- [references/01-convergence-triggers.md](references/01-convergence-triggers.md): conditions that require convergence.
- [references/02-non-convergence-exceptions.md](references/02-non-convergence-exceptions.md): allowed cases for leaving repetition in place.

Detailed prohibition files:

- [references/10-duplicate-functions-logic.md](references/10-duplicate-functions-logic.md): duplicate functions, callbacks, business logic, data processing, conversion, formatting, validation, error handling, async state, and fallbacks.
- [references/11-thin-wrappers-pseudo-encapsulation.md](references/11-thin-wrappers-pseudo-encapsulation.md): thin wrappers, fake encapsulation, meaningless helpers, pseudo-composables, premature interfaces, and no-value third-party wrappers.
- [references/12-types-pseudo-types.md](references/12-types-pseudo-types.md): duplicate types, pseudo-types, DTO/VO/Form/Model duplication, repeated enums, repeated const maps, and runtime/type value drift.
- [references/13-components-composables.md](references/13-components-composables.md): duplicate components, props, emits, slots, composables, hooks, UI behavior, and `useXxx` naming.
- [references/14-api-requests.md](references/14-api-requests.md): duplicate API entry points, request construction, response normalization, request boundaries, cache, retry, timeout, and cancellation.
- [references/15-state-store.md](references/15-state-store.md): duplicate state, stores, filters, pagination, sorting, cache, refresh, derived state, local/store/query boundaries, and server state.
- [references/16-events-side-effects.md](references/16-events-side-effects.md): event listeners, subscriptions, timers, keyboard shortcuts, resize, scroll, visibilitychange, watch, and side-effect cleanup.
- [references/17-style-ui-variants.md](references/17-style-ui-variants.md): repeated Tailwind classes, base component styles, UI state styles, variants, dark mode, responsive layout, and design tokens.
- [references/18-magic-values-constants.md](references/18-magic-values-constants.md): magic strings, magic numbers, routes, keys, regexes, intervals, page sizes, defaults, and repeated constants.
- [references/19-naming-concept-drift.md](references/19-naming-concept-drift.md): naming drift, concept drift, vague utility buckets, public import paths, export names, and terminology.
- [references/20-config-templates.md](references/20-config-templates.md): repeated tsconfig, eslint, vite, vitest, tailwind, bundler configs, scripts, dependency rules, env, and build/test flows.
- [references/21-dependencies.md](references/21-dependencies.md): duplicate dependency capabilities and dependency introduction checks.
- [references/22-tests.md](references/22-tests.md): duplicate tests, meaningless tests, mock-only tests, helpers, fixtures, and behavior coverage.
- [references/23-docs-comments.md](references/23-docs-comments.md): duplicate docs, comments, examples, TODOs, FIXME, and comment value.
- [references/24-files-directories.md](references/24-files-directories.md): duplicate files, directories, shared/common/utils/helpers boundaries, barrel exports, and public API paths.
- [references/25-pseudo-architecture.md](references/25-pseudo-architecture.md): pseudo-architecture, over-layering, design patterns, provider/adapter/driver, registry/factory, and valid abstraction conditions.
- [references/26-complexity.md](references/26-complexity.md): nesting, deep branches, God functions/classes, mixed responsibilities, complex conditions, and complexity reduction.
- [references/27-mirrors.md](references/27-mirrors.md): mirror constants, mirror variables, mirror function bodies, derived mirrors, and intermediate mirror constants.

Convergence practice files:

- [references/30-function-convergence.md](references/30-function-convergence.md): function-level convergence patterns.
- [references/31-type-convergence.md](references/31-type-convergence.md): type convergence patterns.
- [references/32-component-convergence.md](references/32-component-convergence.md): component convergence patterns.
- [references/33-request-convergence.md](references/33-request-convergence.md): request convergence patterns.
- [references/34-state-convergence.md](references/34-state-convergence.md): state convergence patterns.
- [references/35-style-convergence.md](references/35-style-convergence.md): style convergence patterns.

The reference files are the complete source of truth for this skill. Apply them exactly.

## Operating Rules

- Enforce the reference rules as mandatory project constraints.
- Do not paraphrase the rules into weaker guidance when deciding whether code is acceptable.
- Do not create mirror constants, mirror variables, mirror function bodies, derived mirrors, or intermediate mirror constants.
- Prefer one trusted entry point for each stable capability, business rule, type, API call, style variant, state pattern, and shared behavior.
- Allow local repetition only when the reference explicitly allows it.
- Reject abstractions that do not add semantic value, type unification, behavioral unification, a stable entry point, an isolated variation point, lower maintenance cost, lower test cost, or lower caller cognitive load.

## Hard Ban: No Thin Single-Purpose Helpers

Treat the following as prohibited by default, not style preferences:

- one-line wrappers that only rename an expression;
- one-line wrappers that only rename a standard-library or existing helper call;
- single-call-site helpers that only hide an inline `trim`, `split`, `join`, `basename`, `dirname`, regex `test`, numeric guard, or nullish fallback;
- tiny parsing helpers that only wrap `typeof`, `Number.isFinite`, `Math.trunc`, or `toISOString` without creating a real shared business rule;
- wrapper chains such as `a -> b -> c` where each layer only forwards parameters or renames the same operation.

The following patterns are explicitly banned unless they unify a real cross-module rule:

- `function toNumber(value) { return typeof value === 'number' ... }`
- `function toOptionalNumber(value) { return typeof value === 'number' ... }`
- `function isX(name) { return /.../.test(name) }`
- `function getSessionId(filePath) { return basename(filePath, '.jsonl') }`
- `function getConfigPath(root) { return join(root, 'config.toml') }`
- `function getTraceId(record) { return normalizeStringValue(record.traceId) || ... }`
- `function getAttributeString(attrs, key) { return normalizeStringValue(attrs[key]) }`

Before introducing any helper function, require all of the following to be true:

- it is used by more than one meaningful call site, or it marks a stable external boundary;
- its name captures a real domain rule, not a mechanical transformation;
- inlining it back at the call site would clearly make the code harder to change or easier to misuse.

If those conditions are not met, inline the expression directly.

## Review Checklist

When touching code, check for:

- duplicated logic, data conversion, formatting, validation, error handling, async state, and fallback behavior;
- thin wrappers, fake encapsulation, meaningless layers, and premature abstractions;
- duplicated or semantically identical types, enums, const maps, DTOs, VOs, Forms, and Models;
- duplicated components, props, emits, slots, composables, hooks, UI interaction logic, and UI variants;
- duplicated API entry points, request paths, query construction, response normalization, headers, caching, retry, timeout, and cancellation logic;
- duplicated store state, local state, URL query state, cache logic, refresh logic, subscriptions, timers, and side effects;
- magic strings, magic numbers, repeated constants, scattered keys, scattered routes, and mirror values;
- naming drift, concept drift, multiple public import paths, vague utility buckets, and barrel exports that hide unclear boundaries;
- duplicated configs, dependencies, tests, docs, comments, files, directories, and pseudo-architecture;
- uncontrolled function, module, condition, and responsibility complexity.

## Output Requirements

- Mention the main convergence or boundary decision when it affects the implementation.
- If leaving repetition in place, state which allowed exception from the reference applies.
- If rejecting or removing an abstraction, state the concrete missing value.
