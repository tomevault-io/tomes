# AdCP Media Buy Protocol

This skill enables you to execute the AdCP Media Buy Protocol with sales agents. Use the standard MCP tools (`get_products`, `create_media_buy`, `sync_creatives`, etc.) exposed by the connected agent.

## Overview

The Media Buy Protocol provides 8 standardized tasks for managing advertising campaigns:

| Task | Purpose | Response Time |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `get_products` | Discover inventory using natural language | ~60s |
| `list_authorized_properties` | See publisher properties | ~1s |
| `list_creative_formats` | View creative specifications | ~1s |
| `create_media_buy` | Create campaigns | Minutes-Days |
| `update_media_buy` | Modify campaigns | Minutes-Days |
| `sync_creatives` | Upload creative assets | Minutes-Days |
| `list_creatives` | Query creative library | ~1s |
| `get_media_buy_delivery` | Get performance data | ~60s |

## Typical Workflow

1. **Discover products**: `get_products` with a natural language brief
2. **Review formats**: `list_creative_formats` to understand creative requirements
3. **Create campaign**: `create_media_buy` with selected products and budget
4. **Upload creatives**: `sync_creatives` to add creative assets
5. **Monitor delivery**: `get_media_buy_delivery` to track performance

## Key Concepts

### Brand identity

Brand context is provided by domain reference:

```json
{
  "brand": {
    "domain": "acmecorp.com"
  }
}
```

The agent resolves the domain to retrieve the brand's identity (name, colors, guidelines, etc.) from its `brand.json` file.

### Format IDs

Creative format identifiers are structured objects:
```json
{
  "format_id": {
    "agent_url": "https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org",
    "id": "display_300x250"
  }
}
```

The `agent_url` specifies which creative agent defines the format. Use `https://creative.adcontextprotocol.org` for standard IAB formats.

### Pricing Options

Products include `pricing_options` array. Each option has:
- `pricing_option_id`: Use this in `create_media_buy`
- `pricing_model`: "cpm", "cpm-auction", "flat-fee", etc.
- `price`: Base price (for fixed pricing)
- `floor`: Minimum bid (for auction)

For auction pricing, include `bid_price` in your package.

### Asynchronous Operations

Operations like `create_media_buy` and `sync_creatives` may require human approval. The response includes:
- `status: "pending"` - Operation awaiting approval
- `task_id` - For tracking async progress

Poll or use webhooks to check completion status.

## Error Handling

Common error patterns:

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid parameters - check required fields
- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid or missing authentication token
- **404 Not Found**: Invalid product_id, media_buy_id, or creative_id
- **422 Validation Error**: Schema validation failure - check field types

Error responses include:
```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
      "message": "budget must be greater than 0",
      "field": "packages[0].budget"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Testing Mode

For testing without real transactions, agents may support:
- `X-Dry-Run: true` header - Preview without side effects
- Test products with `test: true` flag
- Sandbox environments

Ask the agent about testing capabilities before creating real campaigns.
