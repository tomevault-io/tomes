description: Add an entity, resource, model, table or CRUD feature to an Arandu (Go) application. Use when the request is to "create a model", "add a resource", "scaffold CRUD", "add invoices", "make a posts table", "generate a module", or any new domain object with a database table and rules about who may touch it. In Arandu the model writes a YAML specification and a deterministic generator writes the Go — never write the entity, repository, policy or migration by hand. Covers aru schema, aru generate, the ten column types, the five actions, and the custom blocks that survive regeneration. Use when this capability is needed.

# Adding a module to an Arandu application

You do not write the Go. You write a specification and a deterministic generator
writes the entity, the policy, the repository, the service, the request, the
routes and the tests.

This is not a preference. A new framework is in nobody's training set, so a
model asked for Go here fills the gap with the frameworks it does know and
produces a service container, a fillable model, a facade — none of which exist.
A specification is small enough to be right, and a wrong one fails validation
instead of becoming Go that does not compile.

## The procedure

**1. Read the schema.** It is generated from the validator's own constants, so
it cannot drift from what the generator accepts.

```sh
aru schema
```

**2. Write the specification.** One file, six top-level properties, and the
schema refuses any property it does not know.

```yaml
# invoice.yaml
version: "1"
name: invoice
description: An invoice sent to a customer.
tenant: true
fields:
  - name: reference
    type: string
    required: true
    unique: true
  - name: total
    type: money
  - name: sent_at
    type: timestamp
permissions:
  view: [member, admin]
  create: [admin]
  update: [admin]
  delete: [admin]
```

**3. Check it before anything is written.**

```sh
aru generate invoice.yaml --check
```

Everything wrong with the document is reported at once. Fix all of it and check
again.

**4. Generate.**

```sh
aru generate invoice.yaml
```

**5. Wire it.** The generator prints the lines to paste into `bootstrap/app.go`.
It does not edit that file, on purpose: a generator that changes the wiring
behind you is a generator whose output nobody can explain.

**6. Run the gates.**

```sh
export GOWORK=off
aru view:build && go build ./... && go vet ./... && go test -race ./... && aru doctor
```

## The two closed sets

Column types, and nothing else is accepted:

`string` `text` `int` `decimal` `money` `bool` `date` `timestamp` `uuid` `email`

`money` is stored in cents as an integer. `decimal` is never money — a
fractional binary number is the wrong shape for an amount and the schema says so.

Actions, and nothing else: `view` `create` `update` `delete` `list`.

They are closed because an open set is a type system, and a type system is a
language somebody maintains forever.

## What falls outside

A case the specification cannot express is written in Go, between the markers
the generator preserves:

```go
// arandu:begin custom
// Your code here survives the next `aru generate`.
// arandu:end custom
```

Do not widen the specification to fit one case. That is how a schema becomes a
language.

## What the generated code guarantees, and you must not undo

- Every repository method takes `security.Grant` before the id. Removing it to
  make something compile is removing the only thing that makes the query safe.
- The tenant comes from `data.Tenant(g)`. Never from a path segment, a body, a
  query or a header.
- The generated policy denies every action, with no allow-everything branch to
  delete later. Open it deliberately, one action at a time.

If you find yourself wanting to reach a repository without a Grant, stop. There
is no correct way to do it, and the compiler is what says so.
