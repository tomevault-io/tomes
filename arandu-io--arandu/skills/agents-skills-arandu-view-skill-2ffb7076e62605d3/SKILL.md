description: Write or change a page, layout, template, HTML fragment or component usage in an Arandu (Go) application — anything under resources/views. Use when the request is to "add a page", "change the layout", "make a form", "render a list", "style this", or when an HTMX fragment is involved. The templates are .kyse.go files compiled to Go, and the syntax, the escaping rules and the Content-Security-Policy constraints are not the ones any other template engine uses. Covers @extends, @section, @foreach, the typed data struct, escaped versus raw interpolation, and why an inline style or an Alpine shorthand will not work. Use when this capability is needed.

# Writing a view

A view is Go. You write `resources/views/home.kyse.go`; `aru view:build`
compiles it to `storage/framework/views/home.go`, which is build output and is
gitignored. An error points at the line you wrote, not at generated code.

## The shape of the file

```go
//go:build kyse

package views

import "github.com/arandu-io/kyse/components"

@go
// InvoiceData is what the controller hands this page.
type InvoiceData struct {
	view.Page

	// Invoices is what the table draws.
	Invoices []models.Invoice
}
@endgo

@extends('layouts.app')

@section('content')
	<h1>{{ .PageTitle() }}</h1>

	@foreach(.Invoices as invoice)
		<p>{{ invoice.Reference }}</p>
	@endforeach

	{!! components.Button(components.ButtonProps{Label: "New"}) !!}
@endsection
```

The build tag is what keeps the compiler out of the file. Everything before the
first tag is Go the compiler would reject; the tag is why it never sees it.

## The procedure

1. Write the `.kyse.go`.
2. `aru view:build` — it names the line if the template is wrong.
3. `go build ./...` — it names the line if the Go is wrong.
4. `aru doctor` — it names the line if the escaping is wrong.

## Directives

`@extends` `@section`/`@endsection` `@yield` `@if`/`@elseif`/`@else`/`@endif`
`@foreach`/`@endforeach` `@forelse`/`@empty`/`@endforelse` `@for`/`@endfor`
`@go`/`@endgo` `@csrf`

`{{ }}` escapes. `{!! !!}` does not. `{{-- --}}` is stripped and never reaches
the page.

## The rules that will bite you

**The data is a struct that embeds `view.Page`. Never a map.** A typo in a map
key is a blank space on a page that answered 200; a typo in a field name is a
build error. `aru doctor` fails a map.

**`{!! !!}` is for a call, not a value.** It is entitled to skip escaping only
because a component function escaped everything it interpolated when it was
generated. A field that already holds markup has been through nothing, and the
first time one of them comes from a person it is stored cross-site scripting.
Write `{{ x }}` or return it from a component.

**`@` starts a directive, so Alpine's `@click` shorthand does not work.** Write
`x-on:click`. The compiler refuses the shorthand rather than guessing.

**No expression goes inside `x-on:`, `x-bind:`, `:` or `x-data`.** Dynamic data
travels in an ordinary `data-*` attribute, where the escaper can see it. This is
what keeps the escaping guaranteed, and it is also what the security policy
requires: pages are served under `script-src 'self'`, so a string compiled into
a function at run time would not execute.

**A style attribute is refused too.** `style-src 'self'` drops `style="..."` as
surely as it drops an inline script. Use a class.

**A loop binding is an ordinary Go name.** `@foreach(.Rows as row)` is fine, and
so is `s`, `err` or `d`. What the compiler refuses is a Go predeclared
identifier — `nil`, `len`, `string` — and it says so with the file and the line.

## Components

Imported, never copied. A component is an exported Go function taking its own
props struct, so a component that does not exist and a field that does not exist
are both build errors.

```sh
go get github.com/arandu-io/kyse/components
```

Do not write a component in the application when the library has one. Do not
copy one out of the library either — a copy stops receiving fixes.

## What is not here

No `node_modules`, no `package.json`, no bundler, no CDN. CSS is Tailwind
through a standalone binary the CLI downloads and pins. If you are about to add
a JavaScript dependency, you are about to be wrong: `resources/` holds no `.js`
at all, and a test fails the build if one appears.
