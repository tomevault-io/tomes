name: papers-query-knowledge-base
description: Queries the local `obsidian-vault/analysis/` notes for research. Finds papers by title, task path, technique tags, venue, or year; summarizes methods and evidence across papers; cites core_operator and primary_logic from analysis frontmatter. When present, `obsidian-vault/index/index.jsonl` serves as the fast filter layer and `obsidian-vault/index/` pages serve navigation and backlink exploration. Use when this capability is needed.

# Paper Knowledge Base

Use this skill to query the local paper corpus across conversations and projects.
The main evidence layer is **obsidian-vault/analysis** (analysis notes with
TL;DR, semantic method/evidence sections, and PDF links). When it exists,
**obsidian-vault/index/index.jsonl** is the fast filter layer for large
vaults, while the Markdown pages in **obsidian-vault/index/** remain useful
for Obsidian jumps and backlink-friendly browsing.

**Where the knowledge base lives:** Under the current repository root that contains `obsidian-vault/analysis/` and `obsidian-vault/paperPDFs/`. `obsidian-vault/index/` is a generated companion layer created by `papers-build-index`.

## Paths

- Use repo-relative paths rooted at the folder that contains `obsidian-vault/analysis/` and `obsidian-vault/paperPDFs/`.
- When invoking from another workspace, replace these with the correct absolute repository path for your machine.

## Where things live

Relative to the repository root:

- **Analysis notes**: `obsidian-vault/analysis/<Topic>/<Venue_Year>/<Year>_<Title>.md` or flat venue folders such as `obsidian-vault/analysis/ICLR_2026/<Title>.md`; PDF path in frontmatter `pdf_ref`.
- **Generated index / navigation**: `obsidian-vault/index/index.jsonl`, `obsidian-vault/index/paper_index.md`, `_AllPapers.md`, `by_topic/`, `by_method/`, `by_dataset/`, `by_venue_year/`.
- **Public placeholder**: `obsidian-vault/index/README.md` is tracked as a stable explanation file and is not overwritten by index generation.

All paths use forward slashes.

## How to use for research

1. **Find papers** — Search `obsidian-vault/analysis/` directly by title, task folder, tags, venue, year, `core_operator`, or `primary_logic`. If `obsidian-vault/index/index.jsonl` is present, use it first to narrow a large candidate set, then read the matching notes for evidence.

2. **Read an analysis** — Open the matched analysis note directly. Each note has: **Frontmatter** (title, venue, year, tags, aliases, pdf_ref, core_operator, primary_logic, claims; no `category`, `modalities`, or `frontier`); **Quick Links & TL;DR**; method/problem/evidence sections such as `问题与动机`, `整体框架`, `核心模块与公式推导`, `实验与分析`, and `局限性与启发`; and **Local Reading** (PDF). Older notes may still use legacy mixed headings, so match semantically rather than by one exact title string.

3. **Use `obsidian-vault/index/` when helpful** — `index.jsonl` is for fast filtering; the Markdown pages are for coarse topic / method-family / dataset / merged venue-year overview pages, statistics, Obsidian jumps, or backlink exploration. Use `venue`, `year`, and `venue_year` fields for structured filtering; use `methods` for exact method names and `method_groups` for low-cardinality method-family filtering.

4. **Cite in answers** — Use **core_operator** and **primary_logic** from frontmatter for one-line method summary; **Summary** and **Key Performance** from TL;DR for comparison. Link to note: `[[analysis/.../file.md|Title]]`; to PDF: `[[paperPDFs/.../file.pdf|PDF]]`.

## Index frontmatter (for tooling)

Collection pages: `type: paper-index`, `dimension: topic | method | dataset | venue_year | all`, and optional `topic:` / `method:` / `dataset:` / `venue_year:`.

For exact paths and frontmatter schema, see [references/structure.md](references/structure.md).

## Regenerating the collection (optional)

If you want refreshed `obsidian-vault/index/index.jsonl` and the Obsidian navigation pages, from the repository root:

```bash
python .claude/skills/papers-build-index/scripts/build_paper_index.py
```

The public repository may produce an empty index until local paper rows or
analysis notes are added. Notes with clear paper evidence in frontmatter, body
metadata rows, or venue/year paths can be indexed even when `pdf_ref` still
needs repair.

## Output style

- KB-grounded answers to research questions
- evidence-backed cross-paper summaries in prose
- direct pointers to relevant `obsidian-vault/analysis/...` notes and local PDFs when useful

## Boundaries

- This skill handles both text summaries and comparison requests. When comparing papers, provide honest text-based analysis that acknowledges metric incomparability (different datasets, evaluation protocols, etc.) rather than forcing misleading tabular comparisons.
- This skill can point out evidence-backed research gaps, but it does not generate systematic idea candidates, scope cuts, or experimental roadmaps. Use `research-brainstorm-from-kb` or `idea-focus-coach` for that.
- This skill does not issue reviewer-style acceptance or rejection risk verdicts. Use `reviewer-stress-test`.
- If the retrieval goal is to support an upcoming code change, use this skill in
  code-context mode rather than the legacy `code-context-paper-retrieval` alias.
