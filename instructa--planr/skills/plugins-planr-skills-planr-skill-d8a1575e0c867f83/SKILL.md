name: planr
description: Single entry point for all Planr work. Use for any product, feature, fix, status, review, or summary request when the user has not named a specific Planr skill. Routes to the right Planr skill from live map state so the user never has to remember skill names. Use when this capability is needed.

# Planr Router

You are the dispatcher. Do not improvise workflow prompts; route to one Planr skill and follow it exactly. Skills are the prompts.

## Read State First

Apply the canonical [Evidence ownership guard](#evidence-ownership-guard) before any product-preparation or product-making route.

## Evidence Ownership Guard

Before goal preparation or product implementation that requires binding Evidence, inspect the repository's existing Evidence policy and capability. If either is absent, record the exact Planr capability gap or hold—including its gap code, capability, and next action—and stop. When they exist, planning may select their named presets and explicitly run `planr evidence migrate --from-plan <plan-id> --apply`; Planr Core compiles the schema-bound migration. Never author an Evidence policy, schema, capability manifest, adapter, full migration payload, or run index to bypass a hold unless verification infrastructure is explicitly the requested product; its owner must repair the contract before product work resumes.

Routing is decided by live state, not by guessing:

```bash
planr project show --json
planr map show --json
planr review list --open
planr approval list --open
```

If no project exists, initialize before anything else:

```bash
planr project init "Project Name" --client all
```

Initialization happens once per repository. If a project already exists, never re-init: new features, refactors, and fixes get their own feature-scoped plan (`planr plan new "Feature"`), and `planr map build --from <build-plan-id>` extends the existing map with new linked items.

## Routing Table

Evaluate top to bottom; pick the first row that matches both intent and state:

| Intent | State condition | Route |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "build until done", "loop", "finish this feature autonomously" | any | `planr-loop` |
| "set up a goal", "prepare a /goal run", or another explicitly prep-only goal request | no plan or contract for that scope | `planr-goal` (prep only, prints the loop starter) |
| status, "what's left", "what's blocked" | any | `planr-status` |
| summary of completed scope | any | `planr-summary` |
| new idea, PRD, scope, architecture | no plan, or plan needs refinement | `planr-plan` |
| new feature, refactor, or fix on an existing project | project exists, scope has no plan yet | `planr-plan` (feature-scoped plan, then extend the map) |
| plan exists but no map / map needs structure, dependencies, breakdown | build plan checked, map missing or stale | `planr-task-graph` |
| ReviewGate pending or leased | explicit material gate in the active FeatureRun | `planr-review` |
| ReviewGate has findings | active FeatureRun returns `work_packet.mode: "finding_repair"` to its responsible maker | `planr-work` |
| implement, fix, continue work | ready items exist on the map | `planr-work` |
| implement, but nothing is ready | all items blocked | `planr-status`, then report blockers to the user |

## Rules

- Route to exactly one skill per dispatch. If the request spans stages (idea -> running feature), route to `planr-loop` and let the loop sequence the stages.
- Explicit delivery language such as "implement", "work autonomously until complete", or "finish this" outranks missing plan or map state and routes to `planr-loop`. Never turn a delivery request into a prep-only handoff.
- Never skip a stage: no map items without a checked build plan, no FeatureRun completion without Binding Evidence or any explicitly required material ReviewGates, and no review verdict without evidence.
- When delegating to a subagent, prompt it with a skill reference plus item id (for example: `Use $planr-work on item <id>`), never with a hand-written workflow prompt.
- The maker never reviews its own material ReviewGate. Reviews run through `planr-review` in a separate agent or subagent only when the plan or a protected-risk transition explicitly requires one.
- If intent is genuinely ambiguous and state allows multiple routes, ask the user one short question instead of guessing.
