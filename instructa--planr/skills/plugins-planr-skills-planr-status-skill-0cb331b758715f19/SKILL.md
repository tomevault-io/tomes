# Planr Status

Use read-only Planr commands first:

```bash
planr project show --json
planr map show --json
planr map lane --critical
planr map pressure
```

For one item:

```bash
planr trace item <item-id>
planr log list --item <item-id>
```

For active work, include runtime and approval state from `trace item`, `map status`, or:

```bash
planr approval list --open
planr pick stale --older-than-seconds 900
```

## Goal Contract Check

When a loop or `/goal` run asks whether its stop condition holds, use the one-call verdict:

```bash
planr plan audit <plan-id> --json
planr evidence readiness --scope plan --id <plan-id>
planr evidence explain --scope plan --id <plan-id>
```

Audit answers `holds: true/false` from settled outcomes, explicitly required independent material ReviewGates, approvals, and canonical Evidence coverage. Binding Evidence success does not require a final product ReviewGate. Readiness reports configuration/runtime blockers before execution; explain reports exact receipt applicability and gaps. Report `contract holds` or `contract open` plus the exact unmet clauses straight from these outputs. Use `planr search "GOAL CONTRACT"` only to read the contract text itself.

## Verdicts

Use one:

- `complete`: closed with evidence and no open required child/review/approval work.
- `in progress`: concrete work remains and the next step is available.
- `blocked`: progress needs an external decision or prerequisite.
- `unclear / partially verified`: evidence is incomplete or inconsistent.

Never treat checked Markdown boxes or optimistic summaries as proof. Map state and log evidence decide.
