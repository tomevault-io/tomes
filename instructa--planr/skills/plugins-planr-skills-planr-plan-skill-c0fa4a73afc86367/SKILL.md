# Planr Plan

Read and apply the canonical [Evidence ownership guard](../planr/SKILL.md#evidence-ownership-guard) before product planning.

Use this when scope, ownership, acceptance criteria, or verification must be defined before implementation.

## Workflow

```bash
planr project show --json
planr plan new "App idea" [--platform web] [--ai] [--backend]
planr plan refine <plan-id> --note "decision, constraint, or assumption"
planr plan check <plan-id>
planr plan split <plan-id> --slice "narrow implementation slice"
planr map build --from <build-plan-id>
```

## Product Plan Standard

A product plan package must include:

- manifest;
- product spec;
- UX flows;
- design system;
- architecture;
- ADRs;
- AI spec when relevant;
- safety/privacy/security;
- API/data model;
- client and backend implementation specs;
- observability;
- QA;
- release readiness;
- executable tasks;
- references.

## Build Plan Standard

A build plan must include:

- source plan;
- a non-empty `criteria` frontmatter list whose entries contain only a stable `id` and `title`;
- scope decision;
- ownership target;
- existing leverage;
- phases;
- out of scope;
- verification;
- acceptance criteria.

Author criterion identity only in frontmatter, for example:

```yaml
criteria:
  - id: criterion-api-health
    title: API health is observable from the target service
```

Keep the `## Acceptance Criteria` section as readable narrative, never an identity source. Do not infer criterion IDs from prose or decide obligation completeness in this skill; `plan check`, explicit Evidence migration, and the canonical `app/proof` authority own those decisions.

For binding Evidence, inspect `planr evidence policy --json` and select existing named presets by
their observation semantics. The repository policy and registered capability—not the provider or
skill name in the user's prompt—own schemas and execution. If the policy default correctly covers
every criterion, no extra frontmatter is needed. Otherwise author only preset references beside the
closed criterion list:

```yaml
evidence:
  bindings:
    - criterion_id: criterion-api-health
      preset_id: live-api-health
```

Never write `payload_schema`, adapter manifests, `ProofObligation` objects, or a full migration
payload. After the build plan passes `plan check`, bind it explicitly and preflight readiness before
building the map:

```bash
planr evidence migrate --from-plan <build-plan-id> --apply
planr evidence readiness --scope plan --id <build-plan-id>
planr map build --from <build-plan-id>
```

If compilation or readiness fails, report the exact gap and stop. Do not replace trusted Evidence
with a prompt claim or continue into a paid implementation run.

## Route-Aware Tagging

Before writing the task list, check whether the project declares model routing: `planr agents list --json`. If routes exist, their `work_type` selectors are the project's use-case vocabulary (e.g. `frontend`, `backend`, `design`) — and tagging is your job, not the user's; never ask a human to name work types.

Declare the use case in the task list itself — `map build` seeds annotated tasks with that work type directly:

```markdown
### TASK-001 (backend): REST API for todos
- [ ] (frontend) Build the form and list view
```

Match by the task's actual work (UI/components/styling -> a `frontend` route, API/server/storage -> `backend`, and so on); unannotated tasks stay `code`, which the default route covers. For maps that were already built without annotations, retag instead: `planr item update <item-id> --work-type frontend`. The payoff: every pick packet then carries the right profile, model, and paired skill for its use case, so dispatch needs no human routing knowledge.

## Done

Planning is complete only when `planr plan check <plan-id>` passes, binding plans have applied their Core-compiled preset migration and passed readiness, and the next command is clear: split further, build map, or ask the user for a blocking decision.

When the map is built, linked, and tagged, end by naming the execution handoff explicitly — the user should never have to guess the next prompt: `Use $planr-loop on plan <build-plan-id>. Stop condition: all items closed, canonical Evidence coverage holds, and any explicitly required material reviews are complete.` (On hosts with a /goal primitive, `$planr-goal` wraps the same loop for long-running autonomous runs.)

`plan check` rejects empty scaffolds: build plans need a valid unique `criteria` frontmatter list plus content in `## Scope Decision`, `## Verification`, and `## Acceptance Criteria`; product plans must have content in `## Problem`, `## Requirements`, and `## Success Criteria` of `PRODUCT_SPEC.md`. Write those sections before checking — do not pad them to satisfy the gate.
