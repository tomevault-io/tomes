# Planr Goal

Read and apply the canonical [Evidence ownership guard](../planr/SKILL.md#evidence-ownership-guard) before goal preparation.

Prep only. Compile intent into durable Planr state, then stop. During goal prep, do not implement, refactor, verify, or touch product code. Allowed work is reading Planr state, clarifying material ambiguity, creating/refining/checking plans, building/linking the map, storing the contract, and printing the loop handoff.

Evaluation subcommands run only when the user explicitly requests them, the selected item's acceptance criteria require them, or the maintainer release workflow invokes them. Never invoke them as routine or opportunistic goal, loop, or task-graph work.

## Intake

Classify the request:

- specific: compile directly;
- vague: ask at most two questions about outcome and proof, then record labeled assumptions;
- existing plan: preserve its steps, files, and constraints as refinement notes;
- recovery: inspect `planr map show --json` and `planr recover sweep` before creating anything.

Capture a goal oracle: the observable test, browser flow, executed CLI, or real API response that proves the outcome runs.

## Compile

```bash
planr project show --json
planr plan new "<goal>" --platform <platform>
planr plan refine <plan-id> --note "<constraint or assumption>"
planr plan check <plan-id>
planr map build --from <plan-id>
```

Fill required plan sections directly. Give every build plan a non-empty, unique frontmatter `criteria` list with only stable `id` and `title` fields; prose under `## Acceptance Criteria` remains narrative and never supplies identity. Replace the placeholder task with independently verifiable `TASK-00n` slices before `planr map build`. A small coherent change is one implementation item with Binding Evidence; add an independent material ReviewGate only when the plan names protected risk that requires it. Larger scopes still use multiple slices where ownership, dependencies, or independently observable outcomes genuinely differ. Preserve real execution order with `blocks` links. When registry routes use `work_type`, annotate tasks before mapping or retag them afterward; this is prep work, not a user question.

When the repository provides a versioned verification policy and source-bound receipt runner, make that policy the verification owner in the plan. Record the selected profile, exact receipt path/digest, source revision, and the command that validates the receipt. Do not enumerate broad suites independently in every task when the policy already selects them.

## Durable Contract

For plans with binding Evidence, select existing repository named presets as described by `$planr-plan`, then let Planr Core compile and explicitly apply the exact migration before execution. Never write obligations, payload schemas, or full migration JSON directly, and never duplicate `app/proof` completeness rules in the goal contract. Store one contract per plan:

```bash
planr evidence migrate --from-plan <plan-id> --apply
planr evidence readiness --scope plan --id <plan-id>
planr context add "GOAL CONTRACT <plan-id>: DONE when every in-scope item is closed with implementation evidence, explicitly required material reviews are complete, approvals are clear, and canonical Evidence coverage proves <goal oracle>. Iteration budget: 10." --tag goal-contract
```

Never weaken it mid-run. Workers use `planr pick --plan <plan-id>`; termination uses `planr plan audit <plan-id> --json`. Reviews are required only where they add signal; evidence-backed setup work may close directly. Where deployment is in scope, the contract must retain human deployment approval and a bounded live oracle against the deployed result.

## Hand Off

Print: `Use $planr-loop on plan <plan-id>. Recover the goal-contract from Planr and continue until its audit holds or the iteration budget is exhausted.` Ask whether to start, refine, or stop; then stop. Execution belongs to the loop driver.
