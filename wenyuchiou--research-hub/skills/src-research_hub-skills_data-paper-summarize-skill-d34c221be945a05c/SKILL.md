description: After research-hub ingests a cluster of cited papers, fill the per-paper Key Findings + Methodology + Relevance sections in BOTH Obsidian markdown and the Zotero child note. Use when the user says \"fill the TODO Key Findings/Methodology blocks left by research-hub auto\", \"I just ran auto and don't know what these papers are about\", or \"summarize the papers in cluster X\". Invokes a supported LLM CLI on each paper's abstract. NOT for summarizing the user's own manuscript draft — that's `paper-memory-builder`. NOT for cluster-level briefs — that's `research-hub notebooklm generate`. This skill is per-cited-paper only. If the user says \"extract claims from these papers\", disambiguate before acting: their own manuscript draft → `paper-memory-builder`; a cross-paper comparison matrix → `literature-triage-matrix`; per-cited-paper Key Findings → this skill. Use when this capability is needed.

# paper-summarize

The `auto` pipeline ingests metadata + abstract only — Summary / Key Findings / Methodology / Relevance stay as `[TODO]` skeletons in both Obsidian and Zotero. Cluster-level summarization (NotebookLM brief, crystals) does NOT fill per-paper notes. So after `auto`, the user has nothing scannable per paper without opening the PDF.

This skill fills that gap. One LLM call per paper, JSON-validated, written to both vault systems atomically (rollback the markdown change if Zotero write fails so the two stay in sync).

## When to use

Trigger phrases:

- "Summarize the papers in cluster X."
- "Fill the TODO Key Findings for X."
- "I just ran `auto X` and the notes are empty — give me real summaries."
- "Update Zotero notes for cluster X with what each paper actually says."

Not for:

- Generating a single CLUSTER-LEVEL summary — that's `research-hub notebooklm generate` (NotebookLM brief).
- Filling Q&A on the cluster — that's `research-hub crystal emit/apply`.
- Reading PDFs — abstract-only by design. PDF parsing is out of scope; the LLM is told to mark "[PDF needed]" if abstract is too thin.
- Verifying brief vs source — that's `notebooklm-brief-verifier`.

## Inputs

- Cluster slug (must already exist in the vault under `raw/<slug>/`)
- Optional LLM CLI override (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `aichat`, `cursor`, or configured custom adapter)
- Optional `--apply` flag (default off, dry-run)

The skill reads each paper's frontmatter (DOI, year, zotero-key) + the `## Abstract` body block. Papers with empty abstract get a "PDF needed" marker rather than hallucinated findings.

## Outputs

For each paper, three sections are rewritten:

1. **Obsidian markdown** at `raw/<cluster>/<paper-slug>.md`:
   - `## Key Findings` callout block (3–5 bullets)
   - `## Methodology` callout block (one sentence)
   - `## Relevance` callout block (1–2 sentences linking to the cluster topic)
   - Anchor IDs (`^findings`, `^methodology`, `^relevance`) preserved.

2. **Zotero child note** for the paper's parent item (looked up via `zotero-key` frontmatter):
   - Existing note HTML overwritten with `<h1>Summary` + Abstract + Key Findings `<ul>` + Methodology + Relevance.
   - If no child note exists, one is created.

Both writes must succeed for a paper to count as "applied". A Zotero write failure rolls back the markdown change so the two systems stay in sync.

## Failure modes

- **No LLM CLI on PATH**: prompt is saved to `<vault>/.research_hub/artifacts/<cluster>/summarize-prompt.md`. The user pipes it through their LLM manually and re-runs with `--apply`, or calls the `apply_cluster_summaries` MCP tool with the parsed payload. Exit code 0; ok=True.
- **LLM returns malformed JSON**: report is `ok=False` with `error="LLM response had no parseable JSON object"`. No writes.
- **Paper slug in payload not in cluster**: that entry is skipped with reason logged; other entries still applied.
- **Empty key_findings / methodology / relevance**: entry skipped.
- **Zotero write fails for one paper**: that paper's markdown change is rolled back; other papers still applied.

## Verification

This skill's contract is exercised end-to-end by the test suite. The
suites stub the LLM CLI but execute real Obsidian markdown writes against
a fixture vault and real Zotero child-note writes against a mocked Zotero
adapter. Rollback semantics (markdown rolls back if Zotero write fails)
are explicitly tested.

```bash
# Run the full paper-summarize suite (23 tests)
python -m pytest -q \
  tests/test_v069_summarize.py \
  tests/test_v073_parallel_summarize.py \
  tests/test_v080_resummarize.py
```

Coverage breakdown:

| Test file | Count | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/test_v069_summarize.py` | 17 | Prompt builder shape, validator (rejects unknown slugs / empty fields / wrong types), Obsidian + Zotero apply path, rollback when Zotero fails, no-LLM-on-PATH fallback |
| `tests/test_v073_parallel_summarize.py` | 3 | Parallel summarize across multiple clusters, ordering, error isolation |
| `tests/test_v080_resummarize.py` | 3 | Re-summarize behaviour: idempotent on same input, overwrite on different LLM output, --no-zotero path |

For a manual smoke check against a live vault:

```bash
# Dry-run (emit prompt + show LLM output, no writes)
research-hub summarize --cluster <slug>

# Live run (writes to Obsidian + Zotero)
research-hub summarize --cluster <slug> --apply

# Override LLM
research-hub summarize --cluster <slug> --llm-cli codex --apply

# Obsidian-only (skip Zotero — useful when Zotero is offline)
research-hub summarize --cluster <slug> --apply --no-zotero
```

After applying, scan `raw/<cluster>/*.md` — every paper's `## Key Findings` callout should have real bullets instead of `[TODO]`.

## Operating notes

- Findings-first: the prompt instructs the LLM to state the result, not "The paper shows that…".
- Anchored to the abstract: every Key Finding must trace to something the abstract claims. The LLM is told to mark uncertain claims with `[likely]`.
- Idempotent: re-running on a cluster with already-filled findings will overwrite them with whatever the LLM produces this run. Use `--no-zotero` or `--no-obsidian` if you want to preview one side first.
- Same dual-write discipline as the abstract-sync helpers in `.scratch/`: one transactional unit per paper.
