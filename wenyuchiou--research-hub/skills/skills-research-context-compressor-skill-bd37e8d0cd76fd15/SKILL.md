description: Inspect a research repository and write a compact `.research/` workspace manifest (project_manifest.yml, experiment_matrix.yml, data_dictionary.yml) so future AI sessions can orient themselves without rescanning the whole repo. Use when the user asks to "compress this project context", "create a research manifest", or "save the project context for future agents". Use when this capability is needed.

# research-context-compressor

Build a compact, machine-readable workspace memory at the **project root**
under `.research/`. Other research-hub skills (project-orienter,
literature-triage-matrix, paper-memory-builder) read these files instead of
rescanning the repo every session, which is where the token savings come from.

This is the **foundation** skill. Run it once per project and refresh when
the project's research question, datasets, or experiment set changes.

## When to use

Trigger phrases:

- "Compress this project context for future agents."
- "Create a research manifest so future sessions don't reread everything."
- "Save the key project context before we continue."
- "Build a `.research/` folder for this repo."

Not for:

- Compressing source code or generating doc strings — that's a code task.
- Running experiments or analyzing results — those write to `outputs/`,
  not `.research/`.
- Writing the manuscript itself.

## Inputs you should read (whichever exist — priority order)

The compressor reads whatever your project has. **None of these are
required.** If a file is missing, that field of the manifest stays
empty (see "What NOT to do"). Skim, do not deep-read.

**For any project**:

1. `README.md` at the repo root — project overview. Single most useful
   input.
2. `.research/design_brief.md` if it exists — Stage 3a handoff from
   `research-design-helper` (plugin v0.3.12+). Read the frontmatter
   (`project`, `source`, `gap_verdict`) plus section 1
   (Research question) only — informs the `project_manifest.yml`
   `research_question` field. The brief is the authority on the
   sharpened RQ; the manifest mirrors it. Don't deep-read; skim. If
   frontmatter `source: topic_dossier.gaps.yml#<id>` is set, copy
   that gap-id into the manifest's `provenance.from_gap` field
   (forward-compat with the Stage 2 → 3a wire).

**For code-based research projects** (Python / JS / R / Julia / etc.):

3. `pyproject.toml` / `package.json` / `requirements.txt` /
   `renv.lock` / `Project.toml` — primary tools.
4. `scripts/` and `notebooks/` — main entrypoints.
5. `data/` and `outputs/` — datasets and artifacts.

**For qualitative / archival / interpretive projects**:

3. `notes/`, `drafts/`, `sources/` — manuscript-track work.
4. `.obsidian/` — Obsidian vault settings, if present.
5. Any plain-text bibliography file (`bibliography.md`, `sources.bib`,
   `references.json`).

**For both**:

6. `docs/` — long-form descriptions.
7. `.git/HEAD` and `git log --oneline -20` — current branch + recent
   activity, if a git repo.
8. `.research/` (if it already exists) — for refresh, not first-time
   create.

**An empty manifest field is better than an invented one.**

For a worked humanities-project example with minimal scaffold (README + notes/ only, no code, no data/), see `references/example-humanities-project.md`. It illustrates the "empty fields are honest" rule.

## Outputs you must produce

Write these to `<project-root>/.research/`:

- `project_manifest.yml` — top-level orientation. **Required.**
- `experiment_matrix.yml` — per-experiment status. **Required if `scripts/` or `notebooks/` exist.**
- `data_dictionary.yml` — datasets and schemas. **Required if `data/` exists.**
- `run_log.md` — append a single entry recording this run.
- `decisions.md` — leave empty if no ADRs yet; do not invent decisions.
- `open_questions.md` — list any obvious unknowns you spotted (e.g.
  undocumented dataset, missing license, ambiguous entrypoint).

**Stage 2 → 3a provenance (v0.3.13+).** If `.research/design_brief.md`
exists AND its frontmatter sets `source: topic_dossier.gaps.yml#<gap-id>`,
copy that pointer into the `project_manifest.yml` `provenance.from_gap`
field as part of every write:

```yaml
# project_manifest.yml — minimal example showing the v0.3.13 provenance wire
project_name: "..."
research_question: |
  ...  # mirrored from design_brief.md §1 (sharpened RQ)
current_stage: "design"
last_updated: "YYYY-MM-DD"
provenance:
  from_gap: "topic_dossier.gaps.yml#G2"   # exact copy of design_brief frontmatter `source`
```

If no `design_brief.md` exists or its frontmatter `source` field is
empty, omit the `provenance:` block entirely — do NOT write
`provenance: {}` or `provenance: null`. The schema doc
(`docs/research-workspace-manifest.md`) records the field as optional;
absent is the honest state when the upstream chain isn't connected.

If a file already exists, **update don't replace**: keep human-edited
fields, fill in only the empty ones unless the user said "regenerate from
scratch". This rule also applies to `provenance.from_gap` — if a
manifest already has `provenance.from_gap` and the current
`design_brief.md` source differs, ask the user before overwriting
(matches the v0.3.12 provenance-protection logic in
`research-design-helper`).

## Schema reference

Full schema lives in
[docs/research-workspace-manifest.md](../../docs/research-workspace-manifest.md).
Quick reminder of `project_manifest.yml` required fields:

- `project_name`
- `research_area`
- `research_question`
- `current_stage` (one of `discovery / exploration / experiments / writing / rebuttal / submission`)
- `last_updated` (today's date in ISO format)

If you don't know a field, leave it empty (`""` or `[]`). Do **not** guess
research questions, hypotheses, or claims.

## Token-saving behavior

- Read manifest files first if they exist; only inspect code/data when the
  manifest doesn't already cover what you need.
- For large directories, list contents and pick representative entrypoints
  rather than reading every file.
- After running, tell the user: "Wrote `.research/project_manifest.yml`
  (and N other files). Future agents loading the `research-project-orienter`
  skill can now orient themselves without re-reading the whole repo."

## Output format for the user

After writing the files, print a 5-line summary:

```
[research-context-compressor]
  Wrote: .research/project_manifest.yml (3 datasets, 2 entrypoints)
  Wrote: .research/experiment_matrix.yml (2 experiments)
  Wrote: .research/data_dictionary.yml (3 datasets)
  Open questions surfaced: 2 — see .research/open_questions.md
  Refresh later: ask "compress this project context" again.
```

## What NOT to do

- Don't write to `.paper/` — that's `paper-memory-builder`'s job.
- Don't write `.research/literature_matrix.md` — that's
  `literature-triage-matrix`'s job.
- Don't write to `.research_hub/` — that's research-hub's internal cache,
  managed by the CLI.
- Don't invent fields not in the schema. Add a line to
  `.research/open_questions.md` instead.
- Don't overclaim: if the project has no clear research question yet, leave
  `research_question` empty and add a question to `open_questions.md`.
