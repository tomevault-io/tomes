## Instructions

### 1. Find the PR

If no PR number provided, get it from the current branch:

```

If the script is unavailable, fall back to:

```bash
gh pr view --json number,url,title,headRepositoryOwner,headRepository \

```

```

If the script is unavailable, fall back to:

```bash
gh pr view {pr_number} --json reviews,comments
```

Get inline code review comments:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/review-comments/scripts/gh-pr-comments.sh {owner} {repo} {pr_number}
```

If the script is unavailable, fall back to:

```bash
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments"
```

### 3. Categorize Comments

2. Check the file and line being referenced
3. Either:

   - Explain why the current code is correct
   - Ask the user for guidance on ambiguous feedback

```

If the script is unavailable, fall back to:
