# /prepare-task - Prepare Epic for Implementation

Use this skill to take a Plane epic and prepare it for implementation

**Key Differentiator**: Unlike `/implement-task` (which writes code), this skill produces only **plain English specifications** ready for implementation.

## Usage

```
/prepare-task <EPIC-ID>
```

Example: `/prepare-task BETON-42` or `/prepare-task INSP-15`

---


## Workflow

### Phase 1: Epic Discovery

#### Step 1.1: Fetch the Epic

Use the Plane MCP tools to read the epic:

```
mcp__plane__retrieve_work_item_by_identifier:
  - project_identifier: <PROJECT> (e.g., "BETON", "INSP")
  - sequence_id: <NUMBER> (e.g., "42")
```

Read and note:
- Epic title and description
- Acceptance criteria (if any)
- Any attachments or linked resources

> **Note:** Epics are a separate entity type in Plane, but `retrieve_work_item_by_identifier` works for them because they share the identifier scheme. If this call returns unexpected results, see the [Understanding Epics in Plane](#understanding-epics-in-plane) section for troubleshooting.

#### Step 1.2: Identify Linked Resources

Check the epic description for:
- Figma design links
- External API documentation URLs
- Third-party service docs
- Internal wiki references

Use `WebFetch` to read linked resources and extract requirements.

#### Step 1.3: List Existing Subtasks

If the epic already has subtasks or relations:

```
mcp__plane__list_work_items:
  - project_id: <uuid from epic>
  - parent_id: <epic uuid>
```

Or:

```
mcp__plane__list_work_item_relations:
  - project_id: <uuid from epic>
  - work_item_id: <epic uuid>
```

Note any existing structure to build upon.

### Phase 2: Requirements Clarification (Iterative)

This is the most critical phase. Requirements often have ambiguities, gaps, and undefined behaviors.

#### Step 2.1: Analyze Requirements

Review the epic description and identify:

**Ambiguities:**
- Terms that could be interpreted multiple ways
- Missing definitions or examples
- Unclear scope boundaries

**Gaps:**
- Edge cases not addressed
- Error scenarios not specified
- Integration points not detailed
- Performance requirements missing

**Undefined Behaviors:**
- What happens when data is missing?
- How should errors be handled?
- What are the fallback behaviors?
- What are the security considerations?

Do that for both backend and frontend.

#### Step 2.2: Ask Clarifying Questions

Use `AskUserQuestion` to clarify requirements. Group questions by topic:

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
- What happens when [X] is empty/null?
- How should the system respond to [error condition]?
- What's the expected behavior when [boundary condition]?

**Integration Specifics:**
- Which API endpoint(s) should be used?
- What authentication method is required?
- What are the rate limits to respect?

**UX Decisions:**
- What feedback should users see during [action]?
- How should loading states be displayed?
- What happens after [action] succeeds/fails?

**Priority & Scope:**
- Is [feature X] in scope for this epic?
- What's the priority order of these sub-features?
- Are there any hard deadlines or constraints?

#### Step 2.3: Iterate Until Clear

Repeat Step 2.2 until:
- All acceptance criteria are specific and testable
- Edge cases have defined behaviors
- Integration points are fully specified
- No remaining ambiguities

#### Step 2.4: Document Decisions

Keep a record of all decisions made during clarification, e.g.:

```
## Decisions Made

1. **Empty state handling**: Show "No items yet" message with CTA
2. **Rate limiting**: Implement exponential backoff with 3 retries
3. **Error display**: Toast notification for transient errors, inline for validation
...
```

---

### Phase 3: Epic Refinement

#### Step 3.1: Update Epic Description

Enhance the epic description with:

1. **Clarified Requirements**: Rewrite requirements in precise language
2. **Acceptance Criteria**: Explicit, testable criteria in checkbox format
3. **Technical Constraints**: Any technical decisions or constraints identified
4. **Out-of-Scope Items**: Explicitly list what is NOT included

#### Step 3.2: Save to Plane

> **Note:** `update_work_item` works for epics despite them being a separate entity type in Plane. The MCP tool handles them transparently.

Use `mcp__plane__update_work_item` to update the epic:

```
mcp__plane__update_work_item:
  - project_id: <project uuid>
  - work_item_id: <epic uuid>
  - description_html: <updated HTML description>
```

**Example Updated Description (HTML):**

```html
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>[Refined description of what the epic accomplishes]</p>

<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>
<ul>
  <li>[ ] Criterion 1 (specific, testable)</li>
  <li>[ ] Criterion 2</li>
  <li>[ ] Criterion 3</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Constraints</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Must use existing Supabase client pattern</li>
  <li>API must support pagination</li>
</ul>

<h2>Out of Scope</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bulk operations (future epic)</li>
  <li>Export functionality (future epic)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Decisions Made</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Empty state:</strong> Show "No items yet" with CTA</li>
  <li><strong>Error handling:</strong> Toast for API errors, inline for validation</li>
</ul>
```

### Phase 4: Task Breakdown

#### Step 4.1: Decompose Into Implementable Tasks

Break the epic into tasks that:
- Can be completed in 1-4 hours
- Have clear boundaries
- Have minimal overlap with other tasks
- Follow a logical dependency order

**Typical task categories:**
1. Database migrations (if needed), use /supabase-postgres-best-practices mandatory
2. API endpoints (backend logic)
3. Frontend components/pages, /web-design-guidelines + /vercel-react-best-practices mandatory
4. Integration wiring
5. Error handling & edge cases
6. Polish & UX improvements /web-design-guidelines mandatory
7. Adding analytical events that are sent to Posthog and Intercom via Google Tag Manager + their properties + user properties
8. Tasks for implementing onboarding flow in Intercom – pop-up messages, emails, product tours etc. Should be done in GTM project of Plane
9. Tasks for marketing to announce launch of feature by adding it to weekly changelog newsletter
10. If there are any changes to Stripe – tasks in Ops project in Plane to test and reflect them in production

#### Step 4.2: Create Subtasks

For each task, use `mcp__plane__create_work_item` with structured description:

```
mcp__plane__create_work_item:
  - project_id: <project uuid>
  - name: <task title>
  - description_html: <structured description - see template below>
  - type: <task type id>
  - parent: <epic uuid>  # Links this work item as a child of the epic
```

**IMPORTANT:** Set `parent` to the epic's UUID to establish the parent-child relationship. This is how work items are associated with epics in Plane.

> **Epic parent constraint:** Each work item can belong to at most one epic via the `parent` field. The parent must be a work item type where `is_epic: true`. If the epic type is not found, verify epics are enabled in the project settings and run `list_work_item_types` to confirm.

#### Step 4.3: Create Task Relations

For tasks with dependencies, create relations:

```
mcp__plane__create_work_item_relation:
  - project_id: <project uuid>
  - work_item_id: <source task uuid>
  - related_work_item_id: <target task uuid>
  - relation_type: "blocking"  # or "blocked_by", "relates_to"
```

**Relation types:**
- `blocking`: This task blocks the target task
- `blocked_by`: This task is blocked by the target task
- `relates_to`: Tasks are related but not dependent

---

### Phase 5: Test Planning

#### Step 5.1: Identify Test Areas

For each feature area in the epic, identify:
- Happy path scenarios
- Error/failure scenarios
- Edge cases
- Security considerations
- Performance concerns

#### Step 5.2: Create Test Tasks

Create **separate test tasks** for each major feature area:

```
mcp__plane__create_work_item:
  - project_id: <project uuid>
  - name: "Test: <feature name>"
  - description_html: <test cases - see template below>
  - type: <task type id>
  - parent: <epic uuid>
```

#### Step 5.3: Link Test Tasks

Link test tasks to their implementation tasks:

```
mcp__plane__create_work_item_relation:
  - project_id: <project uuid>
  - work_item_id: <test task uuid>
  - related_work_item_id: <implementation task uuid>
  - relation_type: "relates_to"
```

Make sure that implementation tasks depend on test tasks. This way, you will write the tests firsts and then code that passes it, not the other way around. No cheating!

---

### Phase 6: Documentation & Diagrams

#### Step 6.1: Add Mermaid Diagrams

Where helpful, add Mermaid diagrams to task descriptions:

**Sequence Diagram (API Flow):**
```
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend
    participant A as API
    participant D as Database

    U->>F: Click action
    F->>A: POST /api/resource
    A->>D: Insert record
    D-->>A: Return ID
    A-->>F: 201 Created
    F-->>U: Show success
```
```

**State Diagram (Workflow):**
```
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft
    Draft --> Pending: Submit
    Pending --> Active: Approve
    Pending --> Draft: Reject
    Active --> Completed: Finish
    Completed --> [*]
```
```

**ER Diagram (Data Model):**
```
```mermaid
erDiagram
    WORKSPACE ||--o{ ACCOUNT : contains
    ACCOUNT ||--o{ SIGNAL : generates
    SIGNAL }o--|| SIGNAL_TYPE : has
```
```

#### Step 6.2: Attach Documentation Links

For each relevant task, attach documentation:

```
mcp__plane__create_work_item_link:
  - project_id: <project uuid>
  - work_item_id: <task uuid>
  - url: <documentation URL>
  - title: <link title>
```

**Common link types:**
- Plane wiki pages
- GitHub repos
- Third-party API docs (PostHog, Stripe, etc.)
- Design files (Figma)
- Internal architecture docs


> Important:
> If the task or subtask requires external API – link to the docs is mandatory
> If the task or subtask requires using a new open source tool – link to the repo and docs is mandatory

---

### Phase 7: API Exploration

If the tasks or involves third-party APIs:

#### Step 7.1: Identify APIs Involved

List all external APIs the task requires

#### Step 7.2: Request Credentials

Use `AskUserQuestion` to request:
- API keys (for testing)
- Environment details (staging vs production)
- Rate limit information
- Special access requirements

**Never hardcode credentials** - request them interactively.

#### Step 7.3: Test APIs

Use curl to understand API behavior:

```bash
# Example: Test an API endpoint
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  "https://api.example.com/v1/resource" | jq
```

If you only get 4xx and 5xx – use `AskUserQuestion` again for correct credentials/documentation

Document:
- Request format (headers, body)
- Response structure (fields, types)
- Error responses (status codes, error format)
- Rate limits (headers, quotas)

#### Step 7.4: Update Task Descriptions

Add concrete API examples to relevant subtask descriptions:

```html
<h3>API Reference</h3>
<p><strong>Request:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
POST https://api.posthog.com/api/projects/{project_id}/events
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {api_key}
Body: { "event": "page_view", "distinct_id": "user_123" }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<pre><code>
{
  "status": 1,
  "queued": true
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Error Response (401):</strong></p>
<pre><code>
{ "detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided." }
</code></pre>
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Epic not found | Verify project identifier and sequence ID |
| MCP tool fails | Check Plane connection with `/mcp status` |
| Can't create subtask | Ensure `parent` is set to epic's UUID |
| Relation not created | Verify both work item UUIDs exist |
| User not responding to questions | Simplify questions, provide context |
| Epic type not found | Run `list_work_item_types` and look for `is_epic: true`; verify epics are enabled in project settings |

---

## Notes

- **This skill complements `/implement-task`** - use `prepare-task` first, then `implement-task`
- **All output is plain English** - no code implementations in epic or subtasks
- **Mermaid diagrams go in task descriptions** - Plane renders them
- **API exploration uses curl** - not code implementations
- **Credentials are requested via `AskUserQuestion`** - never hardcoded
- **Test tasks are separate work items** - linked via `relates_to` relation
- **Be thorough in clarification** - unclear requirements lead to rework
- **Document decisions** - future developers need context
