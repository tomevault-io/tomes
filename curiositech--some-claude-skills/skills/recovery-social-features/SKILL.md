# Recovery-Focused Social Features

Build privacy-first social features for addiction recovery apps. These patterns prioritize anonymity, safety, and the unique relationship structures in recovery communities.

## When to Use

✅ **USE this skill for:**
- Sponsor/sponsee relationship systems
- Recovery-focused group features (meeting groups, accountability circles)
- Privacy-first friend connections with mutual consent
- Safe messaging between recovery peers
- Anonymity-preserving profile systems

❌ **DO NOT use for:**
- General social media patterns → use standard social feature docs
- Dating or romantic connection features → not appropriate for recovery context
- Public-facing profiles → recovery apps should default to privacy
- Content recommendation algorithms → use `recovery-community-moderator` for content safety

## Core Principles

### Privacy by Default

Recovery apps handle sensitive data. Default to maximum privacy, let users opt into visibility.

```typescript
interface PrivacySettings {
  profileVisibility: 'private' | 'friends' | 'community';
  showSobrietyDate: boolean;
  showProgram: boolean;        // AA, NA, CMA, etc.
  showLocation: 'none' | 'city' | 'region';
  allowMessages: 'none' | 'friends' | 'sponsors' | 'all';
  anonymousInGroups: boolean;  // Use display name only
}

// Default to most private
const DEFAULT_PRIVACY: PrivacySettings = {
  profileVisibility: 'friends',
  showSobrietyDate: false,
  showProgram: false,
  showLocation: 'none',
  allowMessages: 'friends',
  anonymousInGroups: true,
};
```

### Anonymity Support

Many users need complete anonymity. Support display names separate from real identity.

```typescript
interface Profile {
  id: string;
  // Private - never exposed publicly
  email: string;
  realName?: string;

  // Public-facing identity
  displayName: string;        // "JohnD" or "GratefulMember"
  avatarType: 'initials' | 'icon' | 'custom';
  avatarIcon?: string;        // Predefined icon set

  // Recovery-specific
  sobrietyDate?: Date;
  programs: ('aa' | 'na' | 'cma' | 'smart' | 'refuge' | 'other')[];
  homeGroup?: string;         // Primary meeting
}
```

## Feature Overview

### Sponsor/Sponsee Relationships

The sponsor relationship is hierarchical and private. Only the two parties should know about it.

**Key concepts:**
- Invite-based connection (sponsor generates code, sponsee accepts)
- Time-limited invite codes (24h expiration)
- Private by design - no public visibility
- One sponsor per program, unlimited sponsees

**Hooks provided:**
- `useSponsorInvite()` - Generate and accept invite codes
- `useSponsorRelationships()` - List sponsors and sponsees

**Components:**
- `GenerateSponsorInvite` - Sponsor creates shareable code
- `AcceptSponsorInvite` - Sponsee enters code to connect
- `SponsorDashboard` - View all sponsor/sponsee relationships

> **See:** `references/sponsor-sponsee.md` for full implementation

---

### Meeting-Based Groups

Groups that form organically around meetings. Ephemeral by default but can be made permanent.

**Key concepts:**
- Tied to specific meetings or standalone
- Ephemeral groups auto-delete after 24 hours
- Visibility options: public, private, invite-only
- Member limits prevent overcrowding

**Group Settings:**

```typescript
interface GroupSettings {
  name: string;
  meetingId?: string;           // Link to meeting
  visibility: 'public' | 'private' | 'invite';
  ephemeral: boolean;           // Auto-delete after 24h
  maxMembers: number;           // Member limit
}
```

| Visibility | Who Can See | Who Can Join |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| `public` | Anyone | Anyone |
| `private` | Members only | Invite only |
| `invite` | Members only | Has invite code |

**Hooks provided:**
- `useMeetingGroup()` - Create, join, leave groups

**Components:**
- `QuickMeetingGroup` - One-tap group creation at meetings

> **See:** `references/groups.md` for full implementation

---

### Friend Connections

Peer-to-peer connections without hierarchy. Mutual consent required.

**Key concepts:**
- Request/accept flow (no auto-follows)
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
- Blocking supported (one-way, discreet)
- Status: pending, accepted, blocked

**Hooks provided:**
- `useFriendships()` - Full friendship management with real-time sync

**Components:**
- `FriendRequestButton` - Context-aware add/pending/friends states
- `PendingFriendRequests` - Accept/decline UI

> **See:** `references/friendships.md` for full implementation

---

### Safe Messaging

Recovery-appropriate messaging with crisis detection and safety features.

**Key concepts:**
- Real-time message delivery via Supabase
- Crisis keyword detection (non-blocking, shows resources)
- Soft-delete (messages hidden, not destroyed)
- Privacy-first (no read receipts by default)

**Crisis Keywords (trigger resource prompt):**

```typescript
const CRISIS_KEYWORDS = [
  // Suicidal ideation
  'suicide', 'kill myself', 'want to die', 'end it all',
  // Relapse indicators
  'relapse', 'using again', 'fell off the wagon',
  // Self-harm
  'hurt myself', 'cutting', 'self-harm',
];
```

**Best Practices:**
1. **Non-blocking** - Crisis prompts suggest resources, don't block messages
2. **Privacy-first** - Don't log or report crisis keywords automatically
3. **Helpful tone** - Gentle, non-judgmental language
4. **Direct resources** - Link to crisis page, not external sites
5. **Offline capable** - Cache crisis resources for offline access

**Hooks provided:**
- `useMessages()` - Real-time message thread with Supabase subscriptions

**Components:**
- `MessageInput` - Input with crisis detection overlay

> **See:** `references/messaging.md` for full implementation

### Accountability Features

Sharing recovery progress with trusted connections.

**Check-In Sharing:**
- Share daily check-ins with selected sponsors
- HALT tracking (Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired)
- Mood and gratitude logging

**Sobriety Visibility Settings:**

| Level | Who Can See | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `private` | Only self | Maximum privacy |
| `sponsors` | Self + sponsors | Accountability focus |
| `friends` | Self + sponsors + friends | Peer support |
| `community` | All app users | Public milestone celebrations |

**HALT Check-In Data:**

```typescript
interface DailyCheckIn {
  date: string;
  mood: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;  // 1=worst, 5=best
  halt: {
    hungry: boolean;
    angry: boolean;
    lonely: boolean;
    tired: boolean;
  };
  gratitude?: string;
  notes?: string;
}
```

**Components:**
- `ShareCheckIn` - Select sponsors to share with
- `SobrietyVisibility` - Privacy level picker

> **See:** `references/accountability.md` for full implementation

### Safety & Moderation

Content moderation and user blocking for safe communities.

**Moderation Categories:**

| Category | Description | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `crisis` | Suicidal ideation, self-harm | Show resources, don't block |
| `sourcing` | Drug seeking, dealing | Block + flag for review |
| `harassment` | Personal attacks, threats | Block + flag for review |
| `spam` | Promotional content | Block |
| `explicit` | Sexual/graphic content | Block |

**Blocking Behavior:**
- Blocked user cannot send messages
- Blocked user cannot see blocker's profile
- Blocked user cannot see blocker in groups
- Existing messages are hidden (not deleted)
- Blocking is one-way (blocked user doesn't know)

**RLS Policy Pattern:**

```sql
-- Hide content from blocked users
CREATE POLICY "Hide messages from blocked users" ON messages
  FOR SELECT USING (
    NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM friendships
      WHERE status = 'blocked'
      AND (
        (requester_id = auth.uid() AND addressee_id = sender_id)
        OR (addressee_id = auth.uid() AND requester_id = sender_id)
      )
    )
  );
```

**Hooks provided:**
- `useContentModeration()` - Check content against moderation API
- `useBlocking()` - Block/unblock users, check block status

> **See:** `references/moderation.md` for full implementation
