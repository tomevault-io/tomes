## System Prompt

### Critical Legal Requirements for Recovery Apps

#### 1. Medical Disclaimer (MANDATORY)

Every recovery app MUST include clear disclaimers that:

- **Not Medical Advice**: The app is NOT a substitute for professional medical treatment, therapy, or counseling
- **Not Emergency Services**: The app is NOT equipped to handle medical emergencies or crisis intervention
- **User Responsibility**: Users are responsible for their own recovery decisions
- **Consult Professionals**: Users should consult qualified healthcare providers for medical advice
- **No Guarantees**: The app cannot guarantee recovery outcomes

Example language:
```
Junkie Buds 4 Life is NOT a medical service. The content, tools, and community
features are for informational and peer support purposes only. This app is not
intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or condition.

If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 or your local emergency
number immediately. If you are in crisis, please contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis
Lifeline by calling or texting 988.

Always seek the advice of qualified healthcare providers with any questions
regarding a medical condition or treatment.
```

#### 2. Age Requirements

- **Minimum age**: 18 years old (some apps allow 13+ with parental consent)
- **Parental consent**: Required for minors in jurisdictions where allowed
- **Age verification**: Statement of age during signup

#### 3. User Content Licensing

Key principles from I Am Sober:
- **"What's yours is yours"**: Users retain ownership of their content
- **License to display**: Platform gets limited license to display/process content
- **Deletion rights**: Users can delete their content at any time
- **No commercial use**: Platform won't sell user content to third parties

#### 4. Privacy Requirements

**Data Collection Transparency:**
- What data is collected (account info, usage data, health-related data)
- How data is used (service delivery, analytics, improvements)
- Who has access (staff, third-party processors)
- Data retention periods (I Am Sober: 6 years after last activity)

**User Rights:**
- Access their data
- Correct inaccuracies
- Delete their account and data
- Export their data
- Opt out of marketing

**Security Measures:**
- Encryption in transit (TLS)
- Encryption at rest
- Access controls
- Regular security audits

#### 5. HIPAA Considerations

Recovery apps that collect health information should:
- Implement reasonable security safeguards
- Limit data access to authorized personnel
- Have Business Associate Agreements with vendors
- Provide breach notification procedures

Note: Most peer support apps are NOT covered entities under HIPAA, but following HIPAA-like practices builds trust.

#### 6. Regulatory Compliance

**GDPR (EU Users):**
- Legal basis for processing (consent, legitimate interest)
- Data subject rights
- Data Protection Officer contact (if required)
- International data transfer mechanisms

**CCPA (California Users):**
- Right to know what data is collected
- Right to delete
- Right to opt out of sale
- Non-discrimination for exercising rights

**COPPA (If allowing under-13):**
- Parental consent requirements
- Limited data collection for children

- Explain WHY certain policies exist

**Avoid:**
