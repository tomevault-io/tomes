name: session-share
description: Share Claude Code sessions between developers. Use when user mentions "share session", "export session", "import session", "send session to", "continue from colleague", or needs to (1) export current session to file, (2) import session from another developer, (3) hand off work context. Enables private, secure session transfer via direct file sharing. Use when this capability is needed.

# Session Share

Share Claude Code sessions between developers through portable file export/import.

**Version:** 1.0 | **Privacy:** Files are never uploaded to cloud unless you choose to share them

## Script Path Resolution (IMPORTANT)

This skill includes helper scripts in its `scripts/` subdirectory. When Claude Code loads this skill, it shows a line like:

```
Base directory for this skill: /path/to/.../skills/session-share
```

**You MUST use that base directory path to resolve all script references.** Store it as `SKILL_DIR`:

```bash
# Set SKILL_DIR to the base directory shown when this skill was loaded
SKILL_DIR="/path/shown/in/base-directory-line"

# Then run scripts as:
$SKILL_DIR/scripts/export.sh
$SKILL_DIR/scripts/import.sh ~/Downloads/session-file.json
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Export current session
$SKILL_DIR/scripts/export.sh
# Output: ~/session-shares/session-2024-01-20-my-feature.json

# Share the file via Slack, email, AirDrop, etc.

# Other developer imports
$SKILL_DIR/scripts/import.sh ~/Downloads/session-2024-01-20-my-feature.json
# Session appears in agent-deck, ready to continue
```

## Commands

### Export Session

Export the current Claude session to a portable file:

```bash
$SKILL_DIR/scripts/export.sh [options]
```

**Options:**
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--session <id>` | Export specific session (default: current) |
| `--output <path>` | Custom output path |
| `--include-thinking` | Include Claude's thinking blocks |
| `--no-sanitize` | Don't redact sensitive data |

**Examples:**
```bash
# Export current session
$SKILL_DIR/scripts/export.sh

# Export to specific location
$SKILL_DIR/scripts/export.sh --output /tmp/handoff.json

# Export specific session with thinking blocks
$SKILL_DIR/scripts/export.sh --session abc123 --include-thinking
```

**What gets exported:**
- All conversation messages (user and assistant)
- Tool calls and results
- File modifications tracked
- Session metadata

**What gets redacted (by default):**
- API keys and tokens
- Absolute paths (converted to relative)
- Thinking blocks (Claude's internal reasoning)

### Import Session

Import a shared session file and create an agent-deck session:

```bash
$SKILL_DIR/scripts/import.sh <file-path> [options]
```

**Options:**
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--title <name>` | Override session title |
| `--project <path>` | Import to specific project |
| `--no-start` | Don't auto-start the session |

**Examples:**
```bash
# Import and start
$SKILL_DIR/scripts/import.sh ~/Downloads/session-feature.json

# Import with custom title
$SKILL_DIR/scripts/import.sh session.json --title "Feature Work from Alice"

# Import without starting
$SKILL_DIR/scripts/import.sh session.json --no-start
```

## Workflow: Sharing a Session

### Developer A (Exporter)

1. Working in agent-deck session on a feature
2. Needs to hand off to Developer B
3. Runs: `$SKILL_DIR/scripts/export.sh`
4. Gets file: `~/session-shares/session-2024-01-20-feature.json`
5. Sends file to Developer B via Slack DM, email, or AirDrop

### Developer B (Importer)

1. Receives the session file
2. Runs: `$SKILL_DIR/scripts/import.sh ~/Downloads/session-2024-01-20-feature.json`
3. Session appears in agent-deck as "Imported: feature"
4. Starts session - Claude has full context from Developer A's work
5. Continues where Developer A left off

## Export File Format

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "exported_at": "2024-01-20T15:30:00Z",
  "exported_by": "alice",
  "session": {
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "title": "Feature Implementation",
    "original_project": "/Users/alice/my-project"
  },
  "context": {
    "summary": "Last few user messages for quick context",
    "modified_files": ["src/auth.ts", "src/middleware.ts"]
  },
  "messages": [ /* JSONL records as JSON array */ ],
  "stats": {
    "total_messages": 150,
    "user_messages": 45,
    "assistant_messages": 105
  }
}
```

## Security & Privacy

### What's Redacted by Default

| Data Type | Redaction |
|-----------|-----------|
| API keys | Replaced with `[REDACTED]` |
| Tokens | Replaced with `[REDACTED]` |
| Home paths | Converted to `~` |
| Username in paths | Converted to `$USER` |
| Thinking blocks | Removed entirely |

### Best Practices

1. **Review before sharing** - Open the export file and scan for sensitive data
2. **Use direct transfer** - Slack DM, email, AirDrop are more private than cloud links
3. **Delete after import** - Remove the file once imported successfully
4. **Use `--include-thinking` sparingly** - Thinking blocks may contain sensitive reasoning

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Could not detect current Claude session" | Make sure you're in an agent-deck session with active Claude |
| "Session file not found" | Session may not have been saved yet; send a message first |
| Import shows wrong project | Use `--project /correct/path` to specify destination |
| Large file size | Use default settings (strips thinking blocks) |

## Technical Details

### Session Storage

Claude stores sessions in: `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/<session-id>.jsonl`

Path encoding: `/Users/alice/project` becomes `-Users-alice-project`

### How Import Works

1. Reads export JSON file
2. Creates directory: `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-current-project>/`
3. Writes messages as JSONL: `<session-id>.jsonl`
4. Creates agent-deck session pointing to this path
5. Sets `claude-session-id` so restart uses `--resume`

### Dependencies

- `jq` - JSON processing (install: `brew install jq`)
- `agent-deck` - Session management
- `claude` - Claude Code CLI
