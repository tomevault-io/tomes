# DX9 FFP Proxy -- Game Porting

Port a DX9 shader-based game to fixed-function pipeline (FFP) for RTX Remix compatibility. Remix requires FFP geometry to inject path-traced lighting and replaceable assets.

**NEVER MODIFY TEMPLATE CODE.** The following directories are read-only templates:
- `rtx_remix_tools/dx/remix-comp-proxy/` — remix-comp-proxy framework template

To create a game patch, **copy** the template to `patches/<GameName>/` and edit the copy. If the user asks you to edit remix-comp-proxy code, always confirm whether they mean the template or a game-specific copy under `patches/`. Only modify the template if the user **explicitly** says to change the template itself.

**SKINNING IS OFF BY DEFAULT.** Do NOT enable skinning in `remix-comp-proxy.ini`, modify skinning code, or discuss skinning infrastructure unless the user explicitly asks for character model / bone / skeletal animation support. When requested, read `src/comp/modules/skinning.hpp` and `src/comp/modules/skinning.cpp` for the full implementation.

**SKINNING APPROACH: FFP indexed vertex blending, NOT CPU matrix math.** When skinning is enabled, the correct approach is:
1. Keep BLENDINDICES and BLENDWEIGHT elements in the vertex declaration and vertex buffer
2. Upload bone matrices via `SetTransform(D3DTS_WORLDMATRIX(n), &boneMatrix[n])` for each bone
3. Enable `D3DRS_INDEXEDVERTEXBLENDENABLE = TRUE`
4. Set `D3DRS_VERTEXBLEND` to the appropriate weight count (e.g. `D3DVBF_3WEIGHTS`)
5. Let the FFP hardware pipeline do the blending

CPU-side vertex skinning (manually multiplying vertices by bone matrices) is a **last resort only**. It is extremely expensive, tanks frame rate, and should only be considered when FFP indexed vertex blending is not feasible. Always prefer the hardware path above.

## What remix-comp-proxy Does

Each game folder under `patches/<GameName>/` is a self-contained remix-comp-proxy project (copied from `rtx_remix_tools/dx/remix-comp-proxy/`). It is a d3d9.dll proxy that:

1. Captures VS constants (View, Projection, World matrices) from `SetVertexShaderConstantF` via `ffp_state::on_set_vs_const_f`
2. Parses `SetVertexDeclaration` via `ffp_state::on_set_vertex_declaration` to detect BLENDWEIGHT+BLENDINDICES (skinned), POSITIONT (screen-space), NORMAL presence, and per-element byte offsets
3. Routes `DrawIndexedPrimitive` via `renderer::on_draw_indexed_prim`:
   - No NORMAL -> HUD/UI pass-through
   - Skinned + skinning module enabled -> `skinning::draw_skinned_dip()`
   - Rigid 3D (has NORMAL) -> NULLs shaders, applies FFP transforms
4. Routes `DrawPrimitive` via `renderer::on_draw_primitive`: world-space (has decl, no POSITIONT, not skinned) -> FFP; otherwise pass-through
5. Applies captured matrices via `ffp_state::apply_transforms` -> `SetTransform`
6. Sets up texture stages and lighting for FFP rendering (stages 1-7 disabled to prevent stale auxiliary textures reaching Remix)
7. Loads the real d3d9 chain (RTX Remix `d3d9_remix.dll` or system d3d9) via d3d9_proxy

**`rtx_remix_tools/dx/remix-comp-proxy/` is the TEMPLATE.** Each game gets a full copy under `patches/<GameName>/` — the entire folder is self-contained and can be distributed as a standalone repo. Edit `src/comp/` directly in the game's copy.

**Before reading remix-comp-proxy source files**, read [references/remix-comp-context.md](references/remix-comp-context.md) for a skip-list of boilerplate files (~7,000 lines) you should never open, with summaries of what they do. It also lists the ~1,200 lines of files that actually matter for per-game work.

## Porting Workflow

### Step 1: Static Analysis

Run the analysis scripts to understand the game's D3D9 usage:

```bash
# Core discovery
python rtx_remix_tools/dx/scripts/find_d3d_calls.py "<game.exe>"
python rtx_remix_tools/dx/scripts/find_device_calls.py "<game.exe>"
python rtx_remix_tools/dx/scripts/classify_draws.py "<game.exe>"

# Shader constants and vertex formats
python rtx_remix_tools/dx/scripts/find_vs_constants.py "<game.exe>"
python rtx_remix_tools/dx/scripts/find_ps_constants.py "<game.exe>"
python rtx_remix_tools/dx/scripts/decode_vtx_decls.py "<game.exe>" --scan
python rtx_remix_tools/dx/scripts/decode_fvf.py "<game.exe>"

# Skinning analysis (bone palettes, blend weights, suggested INI)
python rtx_remix_tools/dx/scripts/find_skinning.py "<game.exe>"
python rtx_remix_tools/dx/scripts/find_blend_states.py "<game.exe>"

# Render state and texture pipeline
python rtx_remix_tools/dx/scripts/find_render_states.py "<game.exe>"
python rtx_remix_tools/dx/scripts/find_texture_ops.py "<game.exe>"
python rtx_remix_tools/dx/scripts/find_transforms.py "<game.exe>"
python rtx_remix_tools/dx/scripts/find_surface_formats.py "<game.exe>"
```

Scripts are fast first-pass scanners -- surface candidate addresses only. Always follow up with `retools` and `livetools` for deep analysis.

**Alternative: DX9 Tracer capture.** Deploy the tracer proxy (`graphics/directx/dx9/tracer/`) to capture a full frame, then analyze with `--matrix-flow`, `--vtx-formats`, `--shader-map`, and `--const-provenance` to discover the register layout without reverse engineering the binary.

Key things to find:
- How the game obtains its D3D device (Direct3DCreate9 -> CreateDevice)
- Which functions call `SetVertexShaderConstantF` and with what register/count patterns
- What vertex declaration formats are used (BLENDWEIGHT/BLENDINDICES = skinning)
- Where the main render loop / draw calls live

### Step 2: Discover VS Constant Register Layout

This is the **most critical** step. Determine which VS constant registers hold View, Projection, and World matrices.

**Remix REQUIRES separate World, View, and Projection matrices.** A concatenated WorldViewProj (WVP) or ViewProj (VP) matrix will NOT work -- Remix needs individual matrices to apply its own camera and per-object transforms. If the game uploads a pre-multiplied WVP, the proxy must intercept the individual W, V, P matrices *before* the game concatenates them. This is the #1 source of broken Remix ports.

**Start with the matrix register finder:**
```bash
python rtx_remix_tools/dx/scripts/find_matrix_registers.py "<game.exe>"
```
This cross-references SVSCF call patterns, shader CTAB names, and frequency analysis to suggest a register layout. Always verify its output with runtime data.

**Static approach:** Decompile call sites:
```bash
python -m retools.decompiler <game.exe> <call_site_addr> --types patches/<project>/kb.h
```

**Dynamic approach:** Trace `SetVertexShaderConstantF` live:
```bash
python -m livetools trace <call_addr> --count 50 \
    --read "[esp+8]:4:uint32; [esp+10]:4:uint32; *[esp+c]:64:float32"
```
Captures: startRegister, Vector4fCount, and the first 4 vec4 constants of actual float data.

**DX9 Tracer approach:** Capture a frame and analyze:
```bash
python -m graphics.directx.dx9.tracer analyze <JSONL> --const-provenance
python -m graphics.directx.dx9.tracer analyze <JSONL> --matrix-flow
python -m graphics.directx.dx9.tracer analyze <JSONL> --shader-map
```

**How to identify matrices:**
- View matrix: changes with camera movement; contains camera orientation
- Projection matrix: contains aspect ratio and FOV; rarely changes
- World matrix: changes per object; contains position/rotation/scale
- Look for 4x4 matrices (16 floats = 4 registers). Row 3 often has `[0, 0, 0, 1]` for affine transforms.
- **Watch for concatenated matrices:** If the game only uploads one matrix per draw (e.g. WVP at c0-c3), the individual W/V/P are being multiplied before upload. Trace back to find where the multiplication happens -- you need to capture W, V, P separately before that point.

### Step 3: Set Up Per-Game Project

**IMPORTANT:** `rtx_remix_tools/dx/remix-comp-proxy/` is the **template**. NEVER edit it directly. Each game gets a full copy of the framework.

1. Copy the entire `rtx_remix_tools/dx/remix-comp-proxy/` folder to `patches/<GameName>/` (excluding `build/`)
2. Edit `src/comp/` directly in the game's copy — this is the per-game customization layer
3. Edit register layout defaults in `src/shared/common/ffp_state.hpp` (see Register Layout section below)
4. Edit `src/comp/main.cpp`: set `WINDOW_CLASS_NAME` to the game's window class
5. Customize `src/comp/modules/renderer.cpp` draw routing if needed (see Decision Trees below)
6. Customize `src/comp/game/game.cpp` with game-specific address init if hooks are needed
7. Update `kb.h` with discovered function signatures, structs, and globals

The game folder is now fully self-contained and can be distributed as a standalone git repo.

### Step 4: Build and Deploy

From the game folder:
```bash
cd patches/<GameName>
build.bat release --name <GameName>
```

The build produces `d3d9.dll` in `patches/<GameName>/build/bin/release/`. Deploy:
- `d3d9.dll` to the game directory (the game loads this as its d3d9 proxy)
- `remix-comp-proxy.ini` to the game directory
- `d3d9_remix.dll` to the game directory if using Remix

### Step 5: Diagnose with Log and ImGui

**rtx_comp/diagnostics.log:** Written to the `rtx_comp/` subfolder of the game directory after a configurable delay (default 50 seconds), then logs 3 frames of detailed draw call data:

- **VS regs written**: which constant registers the game actually fills
- **Vertex declarations**: what vertex elements each draw uses
- **Draw calls**: primitive type, vertex count, index count, textures per stage
- **Matrices**: actual View/Proj/World values being applied
- **Raw vertex bytes**: hex dump of first vertices for early draw calls

Do not change the logging delay unless the user asks -- it ensures the user gets into the game with real geometry before logging begins.

**ImGui overlay (F4):** Press F4 to toggle the debug overlay. The FFP tab shows real-time draw call stats, VS constant register write history, and enables a fake camera for testing transforms.

**Tell the user when you need them to interact with the game** for logging or hooking purposes. They must be in-game with geometry visible for the log to be useful.

## Register Layout (`ffp_state.hpp`)

The VS constant register layout is defined as member defaults in `src/shared/common/ffp_state.hpp`. Edit these when porting a new game:

```cpp
// In ffp_state.hpp — private members with game-specific defaults
int vs_reg_view_start_ = 0;
int vs_reg_view_end_ = 4;
int vs_reg_proj_start_ = 4;
int vs_reg_proj_end_ = 8;
int vs_reg_world_start_ = 16;
int vs_reg_world_end_ = 20;
int vs_reg_bone_threshold_ = 20;  // only matters when [Skinning] Enabled=1
int vs_regs_per_bone_ = 3;        // 3 = 4x3 packed bones (most common), 4 = full 4x4
int vs_bone_min_regs_ = 3;        // minimum register count to qualify as bone upload
```

Each matrix occupies 4 consecutive vec4 registers (= 16 floats). After changing defaults, rebuild with `build.bat`.

### Bone Configuration for Skinning

Before enabling skinning, run `find_skinning.py` to determine the bone start register (`vs_reg_bone_threshold_`) and upload pattern. Some games upload all bones in one call; others upload in groups until hitting a max (e.g., groups of 15, max 75). If the game uses grouped uploads, lower `vs_bone_min_regs_` so the proxy doesn't reject the smaller batches. If bone uploads overlap with non-bone constants, raise `vs_reg_bone_threshold_`.

## INI Config (`remix-comp-proxy.ini`)

Runtime settings that don't require recompile:

```ini
[FFP]
Enabled=1
AlbedoStage=0
; Albedo texture stage (0-7). Set to whichever stage the game binds the diffuse texture.

[Skinning]
Enabled=0
; Only set to 1 after rigid FFP works correctly.
; Run find_skinning.py to determine bone register layout before enabling.

[Diagnostics]
Enabled=1
DelayMs=50000
LogFrames=3

[Remix]
Enabled=1
DLLName=d3d9_remix.dll

[Chain]
PreLoad=
PostLoad=
; Semicolon-separated DLLs/ASIs to load before/after the d3d9 chain.
; Example: PreLoad=patch.dll;fix.asi
```

## Architecture: What to Edit vs What to Leave Alone

Each game folder under `patches/<GameName>/` is a **self-contained** copy of the full remix-comp-proxy framework. Edit files directly in the game's copy.

| Component (in `patches/<GameName>/`) | Edit Per-Game? |
|-----------|----------------|
| `ffp_state.hpp` register layout defaults | **YES** — rebuild after changing |
| `remix-comp-proxy.ini` albedo stage, diagnostics, chain | **YES** |
| `src/comp/main.cpp` WINDOW_CLASS_NAME | **YES** |
| `src/comp/modules/renderer.cpp` draw routing | **YES** -- main draw routing |
| `src/comp/game/game.cpp` address init and hooks | **YES** -- per-game hooks |
| `src/comp/game/structs.hpp` game structs | **YES** -- per-game data structures |
| `src/shared/common/ffp_state.cpp` engage/disengage/transforms | MAYBE -- only for unusual FFP needs |
| `src/shared/common/config.hpp` | MAYBE -- add new INI sections if needed |
| `src/comp/modules/d3d9ex.cpp` | NO -- forwards all 119 methods |
| `src/comp/modules/diagnostics.cpp` | NO -- generic frame logger |
| `src/comp/modules/imgui.cpp` | NO -- debug overlay |
| `src/shared/` everything else | NO -- framework code |

### DrawIndexedPrimitive Decision Tree

```
ffp.is_enabled() AND ffp.view_proj_valid()?
+-- NO  -> passthrough with shaders
+-- YES
    +-- ffp.cur_decl_is_skinned()?
    |   +-- YES + skinning module -> skinning::draw_skinned_dip()
    |   +-- YES + no skinning     -> passthrough with shaders
    +-- !ffp.cur_decl_has_normal()?
    |   +-- passthrough (HUD/UI)
    |   GAME-SPECIFIC: remove this filter if world geometry lacks NORMAL
    +-- else (rigid 3D mesh)
        +-- ffp.engage() + draw + restore
```

**Common per-game changes:**
- World geometry omits NORMAL -> remove or change `!ffp.cur_decl_has_normal()` filter
- Special passes (shadow, reflection) -> filter by shader pointer, render target, or vertex count
- UI drawn with DrawIndexedPrimitive + NORMAL -> add a filter (e.g. check stride or texture)

### DrawPrimitive Decision Tree

```
ffp.is_enabled() AND ffp.view_proj_valid() AND ffp.last_decl()
AND !ffp.cur_decl_has_pos_t() AND !ffp.cur_decl_is_skinned()?
+-- YES -> ffp.engage() (world-space particles / non-indexed geometry)
+-- NO  -> passthrough (screen-space UI, POSITIONT, no decl, skinned)
```

## Common Pitfalls

- **Concatenated WVP/VP instead of separate matrices**: This is the **#1 Remix porting mistake**. Remix requires separate World, View, and Projection matrices passed via `SetTransform`. If the game uploads a pre-multiplied WorldViewProj or ViewProj to a single register range, the proxy gets a combined matrix it can't decompose. **Fix**: find where the game multiplies W*V*P (or V*P) and hook that function to capture the individual matrices *before* concatenation. Use `find_matrix_registers.py` to detect this -- if CTAB shows "WorldViewProj" or only one matrix register is uploaded per draw, you have this problem.
- **Matrices look wrong**: D3D9 FFP `SetTransform` expects row-major. `ffp_state::apply_transforms` transposes column-major VS constants. If the game stores matrices row-major in VS constants (uncommon), remove the transpose in `ffp_state::apply_transforms`.
- **Everything is white/black**: Albedo texture is on stage 1+, not stage 0. Set `AlbedoStage` in `remix-comp-proxy.ini`, or trace `SetTexture` calls to find the correct stage.
- **Some objects render, others don't**: Check whether missing geometry has NORMAL in its vertex decl. Check `ffp.view_proj_valid()` is true at draw time. DrawPrimitive routes on decl presence + no POSITIONT + not skinned.
- **Skinned meshes invisible**: Set `[Skinning] Enabled=1` in `remix-comp-proxy.ini`. Check log for skinning errors. Verify `bone_start_reg` and `num_bones` are non-zero in the log.
- **Bones mixed up between NPCs**: Stale WORLDMATRIX slots from a previous object. The game may need a game-specific reset hook at a per-object boundary -- see Skinning Stability below.
- **Game crashes on startup**: Set `[Remix] Enabled=0` in `remix-comp-proxy.ini` to test without Remix. Check `WINDOW_CLASS_NAME` in `comp/main.cpp`.
- **Geometry at origin / piled up**: World matrix register mapping wrong. Re-examine VS constant writes via `livetools trace` or DX9 tracer `--const-provenance`.
- **World geometry shifts after skinned draws**: `WORLDMATRIX(0)` clobbered by bone[0]. The proxy tracks `world_dirty_` for re-application. If still broken, check for bone register overlap with world matrix range in `ffp_state.hpp`.
- **ImGui overlay not appearing**: Press F4. Check that `WINDOW_CLASS_NAME` is correct and the window was found (console output). Check for DirectInput hook conflicts.

### Skinning Stability: Finding Game-Specific Hook Points

The proxy's generic heuristics handle most games. If bones still leak between objects, the game needs a hook at a per-object boundary function -- one that's called once per skinned object, before its bones are uploaded.

**Finding the per-object function:**

1. **Capture** 2+ frames with the D3D9 tracer while multiple skinned NPCs are on screen
2. **Hotpaths**: `--hotpaths --resolve-addrs <game.exe>` -- look at callers of bone-range `SetVertexShaderConstantF` writes
3. **Caller histogram**: `--callers SetVertexShaderConstantF` -- the function that appears N times per frame (N = number of skinned objects) is the per-object boundary
4. **Live confirm**: `livetools trace <candidate_addr> --count 50` -- with 3 NPCs, expect ~3 hits/frame
5. **Static context**: `callgraph.py --up` + `decompiler.py` on the caller -- confirm it loops over objects
