# Github Pr Authoring

1. Base the PR on the actual diff, changed files, and checks. Do not invent tests, commands, or implications.
2. Use this exact body structure:
   - `## What was changed`
   - `## How to review`
   - `## What the implication was`
   - `## Checks and tests performed`
3. For bug fixes, include the original symptom in `## What was changed` only when it adds useful review context.
4. Keep file references in the PR body repo-relative, not absolute local filesystem paths.
5. Use a conventional-commit PR title that summarizes the change.
6. Match the PR body to the size and complexity of the change. For small changes, prefer short prose over diagrams, long review checklists, or padded bullet lists.

## Publication Handoff

- Create and publish PRs as ready for review by default. Use draft state only when the user explicitly asks for a draft PR.
- Use `pr-review-followthrough` for CI, reviewer comments, `pr-review`, and merge-ready iteration after the PR is ready.

## Section Expectations

### What was changed

Describe the change concisely. For small PRs, a short paragraph is enough.

For bug fixes, add an `Original symptom this addresses:` block right after the summary when it helps reviewers understand the change.

### How to review

Point reviewers to the relevant file, section, or commit order. Keep this proportional to the diff.

### What the implication was

Describe the practical impact directly. Use Mermaid only when it materially improves understanding.

### Checks and tests performed

List only checks that add reviewer signal. Prefer:

- tests added or updated for this change
- targeted validation outside normal hook coverage
- meaningful manual verification
- broader gates like `pnpm run ci` only when they add coverage beyond the default flow
- for property-based tests, the invariants asserted, generator bounds, and how failures can be replayed from seed/path

Do not restate obvious command behavior. If a routine command simply passed, say that directly.
