# Canvas Reader

Scan the current Figma canvas to build visual + structural context.
**Goal:** understand what's on the canvas so you can answer questions, give feedback, extract content, or plan next actions accurately.

## Core Principle: Screenshot First, Metadata Later

**ALWAYS get screenshots before diving into node trees.** Screenshots give you 90% of what you need. Metadata/node inspection should only be used for targeted lookups after you already know what you're looking for from the screenshot.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Get Overview + Screenshots

1. Call `get_metadata` (with a fileKey and optionally a nodeId) to get the structural outline — frame names, node IDs, hierarchy.
2. Call `get_screenshot` for each key frame to see the visual content.

**Parse screenshots visually:** Read the UI content, identify components, layouts, text, interaction states — all from the image. You have strong vision capabilities. Use them.

**For large canvases (>10 frames):** Screenshot the first 10, then ask the user if they want to continue or focus on specific frames.

### Step 2 — Targeted Node Inspection (only when needed)

After screenshots, if you need specific node properties (fills, text content, dimensions):

- Use `use_figma` to inspect specific nodes by ID:
```js
const node = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync("NODE_ID");
return { name: node.name, type: node.type, width: node.width, height: node.height };
```

**Never scan the entire tree** — find targets visually in screenshots first, then inspect only what you need.

### Step 3 — Extract Text Content (conditional)

If you need exact text content too small to read in screenshots, use `use_figma` to traverse text nodes:

```js
const frame = await figma.getNodeByIdAsync("FRAME_ID");
const textNodes = frame.findAll(n => n.type === "TEXT").map(t => ({
  id: t.id, name: t.name, characters: t.characters, fontSize: t.fontSize
}));
return textNodes;
```

**Skip this step** if you can read the text from screenshots — you usually can.

## Output Format

Present a structured summary:

**For Flow/Screen Designs:**
```
**Canvas: [Page Name]**
[N] frames — [brief description]
| # | Frame | Description |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 1 | [name] | [what you see] |
```

**For Single Screen / Component:**
```
**[Frame Name]**
[Detailed description: layout, components, states, content]
```

## Editing Workflow

When the user asks you to change something on the canvas:
1. **Screenshot** — visually confirm what needs changing and where
2. **Get metadata** — `get_metadata` to find the node ID
3. **Inspect** — `use_figma` to read specific properties if needed
4. **Modify** — `use_figma` to make the edit

**Rule of thumb:** If you need more than 2 inspection calls to find your target, you're not using screenshots effectively.

## Token-Efficient Queries

The `figma` MCP returns large payloads by default. Apply these rules to keep context lean:

- **Always pass a `nodeId` to `get_metadata`** when you know the target — never let it traverse the full page.
- **Screenshots are visual primary, metadata is targeted lookup.** Don't fetch metadata "just to see what's there" — screenshot first.
- **Cache and reuse.** Component keys, frame IDs, file keys returned earlier in the session are valid for the rest of the session — never re-query.
- **Avoid `get_screenshot` polling.** Image responses are heavy. Use it once at start and once at major milestones.
- **In `use_figma` reads, return only the fields you need** — name + dimensions, not the full node JSON. Each unused field consumed is context wasted.

See `figma-use/SKILL.md` § 4a for the same rules applied to write workflows.

## Tips

- **Parallel screenshots are the #1 priority** — they give you 90% of context
- **Don't scan node trees for discovery** — use screenshots to discover, inspect only for IDs
- **Identify the product** — recognize the product, platform, and active design-system patterns
- **Read text in screenshots** — use your vision capabilities
- **Cache what you've learned** — don't re-scan frames you already screenshotted
