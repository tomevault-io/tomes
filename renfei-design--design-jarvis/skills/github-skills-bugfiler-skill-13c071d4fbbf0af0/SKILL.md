# UX Issue Writer

Use when a user wants a UX, accessibility, content, or design-system problem documented for an issue tracker.

## Workflow

1. Gather the artifact reference, environment, current behavior, expected behavior, and user impact.
2. Reproduce or inspect the issue when possible. Separate observed evidence from inference.
3. Classify the issue: usability, accessibility, content, visual consistency, interaction, responsive behavior, or implementation fidelity.
4. Assign severity based on task impact, affected users, frequency, workaround, and reversibility.
5. Draft a tracker-neutral issue. Do not submit it externally unless the user explicitly asks and an authorized connector is available.

## Output template

```markdown
# <Outcome-focused title>

<What is wrong and why it matters>

Never include credentials, private customer data, employee identifiers, or inaccessible internal links in a public issue.
