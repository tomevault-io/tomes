# Document

Write the human page from work already done in this chat. Distill. Do not copy
`.agentflow/` notes into the docs tree. After the page exists, remove the
working files that were the source.

UI strings and agent guides are out of scope.

[Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/): one page, one job. A how-to that lectures, or
a reference that walks a tutorial, is the wrong page — split and link.

## 1. Source

User-named files win. Else this chat's `.agentflow/<slug>` research or plan, shipped change and grill reading here.

## 2. Where

User-named path wins.

Else find the existing human page that already owns this **domain** — the
system or topic, not this PR. Search the docs tree named in project rules,
repo-root `docs/`, neighboring pages, and `.agentflow/docs/`. Update that
file. Ten PRs on integrations are one integrations page.

No page owns this domain → create one page in that tree, named for the
domain. No human docs tree → write `.agentflow/docs/<domain>/`. Do not
create a repo-root `docs/`.

Read that page (or neighbors) for tone and terms. Write in that language, or
the user's if there are no neighbors. A different Diátaxis job already
covered nearby → link it. Do not add a second page of the same job for the
same domain.

## 3. Job

Infer from the request. Name the pick in one line. Don't interview when the
goal is already in the prompt.

| Reader wants        | Quadrant        | Typical artifact          |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| to learn by doing   | **Tutorial**    | onboarding, first success |
| to get a thing done | **How-to**      | runbook, "how do I"       |
| to look up a fact   | **Reference**   | API, CLI, config, flags   |
| to understand why   | **Explanation** | architecture, design      |

"Document this" with no type: a procedure → how-to; a surface → reference; a
system → explanation.

README is a landing page, not a fifth quadrant. What + why, a short path to
first success, then links to the other three.

## 4. Write

Ground claims in files you read. A path you cite exists, or mark it planned.
Lead with the thing the reader came for. Show commands, requests, and paths.
Don't wait for outline approval unless the user asked for a structure, or the
work is a multi-page set of **different jobs**. Redact secrets.

Write with the picked job's shape in [shapes.md](shapes.md).

## 5. Remove

Delete `.agentflow/<slug>/` working files that were packaged (research, plan,
handoff). Leave `.agentflow/docs/`, `.agentflow/config.json`, and other slugs.
Nothing to delete when the source was only this chat.

Print the page path and what was removed.

## Done

A reader with that goal can finish without another page of the same type.
The domain page is current. The packaged `.agentflow/<slug>/` working files
are gone. A page with no project docs tree lives under
`.agentflow/docs/<domain>/`.
