# Anti-Slop Brain

Operate the deployed vault first. Treat `CODEX.md`, `wiki/hot.md`, and
`wiki/index.md` as vault-root-relative paths, where the vault root is the
directory passed to `--vault` or opened in Obsidian. In this repo, the template
vault root is `assets/template-brain/` and the demo vault root is
`examples/sample-vault/`.

Secretary: use `agents/anti-slop-secretary.md` for grounded answers, claim review,
and vault maintenance. That secretary reads the brain first, cites a vault note
and an official URL, and stays advisory and read-only.

## Commands

```bash
/anti-slop-brain new <client-slug> --owner <name>
/anti-slop-brain ingest --vault <path> --file <source>
/anti-slop-brain synthesize --vault <path>
/anti-slop-brain report --vault <path>
/anti-slop-brain visuals --vault <path>
/anti-slop-brain lint --vault <path>
/anti-slop-brain next --vault <path>
```

Source checkout equivalent:

```bash
anti-slop-brain new <client-slug> --owner <name>
anti-slop-brain ingest --vault <path> --file <source>
anti-slop-brain synthesize --vault <path>
anti-slop-brain report --vault <path> --html-only
```

## Required Operating Rules

1. Read `<vault>/CODEX.md`.
2. Read `<vault>/wiki/hot.md`.
3. Read `<vault>/wiki/index.md`.
4. Preserve `.raw/` as immutable source material.
5. Never store credentials in the vault.
6. Never make domain-specific claims without dated trustworthy sources.
7. Keep `hot`, `index`, `overview`, and `log` current.
8. Record research evidence in `references/source-ledger.json`.
9. Record domain adapter completion in `references/adapter-manifest.json`.

## Script Mapping

- `new` -> `python scripts/scaffold_vault.py`
- `ingest` -> `python scripts/ingest_source.py`
- `synthesize` -> `python scripts/synthesize_brain.py`
- `report` -> `python scripts/render_brain_report.py`
- `visuals` -> `python scripts/generate_vault_visuals.py`
- `lint` -> `python scripts/lint_vault.py`
- `next` -> `python scripts/guide_next_action.py`

## Quality Gates

- No authorship verdict, ever; this brain reports defects, not origin
- No hard failure on a stylistic marker alone; markers route to structural tests
- No claim about detector accuracy, marker frequency, or prevalence without a current cited source
- No credentials, tokens, or private operator content in repo artifacts
- No model self-grading as a release gate; deterministic scanners re-run after every repair

Do not call this brain market-ready unless `scripts/audit_brain.py --require
market-ready` passes. A scaffold is not a finished brain.

## Research Refresh

30 days for model-specific marker cohorts and detector claims; 90 days for corpus studies and regulation; before every release for any numeric claim
