## When to load this skill
- You need to build a new Claude skill that matches Anthropic’s gold-standard structure.
- You are upgrading a legacy skill (single SKILL.md file) into the modular layout.
- You must validate a skill before sharing it with teammates or packaging it for SkillsMP.
- You want to create repeatable automation around scaffolding, validation, or packaging.

## Quick start workflow
1. **Collect requirements** using the prompts in [modules/process-guide.md](modules/process-guide.md#step-1-understanding).
2. **Run the MCP tool**:
   ```python
   adn_skills_creator(
       operation="scaffold",
       skill_name="my-new-skill",
       output_dir="skills/custom",
       category="developer"
   )
   ```
3. **Fill in content** following the templates in `modules/core-guidance.md`.
4. **Validate** and **package**:
   ```python
   adn_skills_creator(operation="validate", skill_path="skills/custom/my-new-skill")
   adn_skills_creator(operation="package", skill_path="skills/custom/my-new-skill", output_dir="dist")
   ```
5. Record sources, update `the status banner`, and publish.

## CLI equivalents
- Scaffold: `uv run am-skill-creator scaffold my-new-skill --output-dir skills/custom`
- Validate: `uv run am-skill-creator validate skills/custom/my-new-skill`
- Package: `uv run am-skill-creator package skills/custom/my-new-skill --output-dir dist`
- Upgrade legacy skill: `uv run am-skill-creator upgrade skills/legacy/old-skill`
