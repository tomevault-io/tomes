## Project Overview

KECS (Kubernetes-based ECS Compatible Service) is a standalone service that provides Amazon ECS compatible APIs running on Kubernetes. It enables a fully local ECS-compatible environment that operates independently of AWS environments.

## Common Development Commands

### Building and Running
```bash
make build          # Build both CLI and server binaries
make build-cli      # Build CLI binary only (bin/kecs - no DuckDB/CGO)
make build-server   # Build server binary (bin/kecs-server - with DuckDB/CGO)
make run            # Build and run CLI
make run-server     # Build and run server
make all            # Clean, format, vet, test, and build
```

#### Binary Architecture
KECS is split into two binaries to resolve cross-compilation issues:
- **kecs** (CLI): Lightweight client without DuckDB, cross-platform compatible
- **kecs-server**: Full server with DuckDB support, runs in containers

### Container-based Execution
```bash
kecs start          # Start KECS in a Docker container
kecs stop           # Stop and remove KECS container
kecs status         # Show container status
kecs logs -f        # Follow container logs

# Multiple instances
kecs start --instance dev --api-port 8080
kecs start --instance staging --api-port 8090 --auto-port
kecs list           # List all instances
```

### Testing and Code Quality
```bash
make test           # Run tests with race detection
make test-coverage  # Run tests with coverage report
make vet            # Run go vet
make fmt            # Format code with gofmt
```

#### Testing Framework
KECS uses **Ginkgo** as the primary testing framework for Go tests:
- Ginkgo provides BDD-style testing with descriptive test specifications
- Tests should be written using Ginkgo's `Describe`, `Context`, `It` patterns
- Use Gomega matchers for assertions
- Place test files as `*_test.go` alongside the code they test

Example test structure:
```go
var _ = Describe("ClusterHandler", func() {
    Context("when creating a cluster", func() {
        It("should return existing cluster when name already exists", func() {
            // Test implementation
            Expect(response).To(Equal(expectedResponse))
        })
    })
})
```

### Docker Operations
```bash
make docker-build   # Build Docker image
make docker-push    # Build and push Docker image
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
make deps           # Download and verify dependencies
make clean          # Clean build artifacts and coverage files

# Hot reload development workflow
./bin/kecs start    # Start KECS instance
make dev            # Build and hot reload controlplane
make dev-logs       # Build, hot reload, and tail logs

# For specific instance
KECS_INSTANCE=myinstance make dev
```

### Kubeconfig Management
```bash
# List all available KECS clusters
kecs kubeconfig list

# Get kubeconfig for a specific instance
kecs kubeconfig get <instance-name>

# Write kubeconfig to a file
kecs kubeconfig get <instance-name> -o ~/.kube/kecs-config

# Use the kubeconfig with kubectl
export KUBECONFIG=$(kecs kubeconfig get <instance-name>)
kubectl get pods -n kecs-system

# Or specify inline
kubectl --kubeconfig <(kecs kubeconfig get <instance-name>) get pods -n kecs-system
```

### Hot Reload Development
KECS supports hot reloading of the controlplane during development:
1. **Start KECS**: Run `./bin/kecs start` to create a k3d cluster with KECS
2. **Make changes**: Edit your Go code in the controlplane
3. **Hot reload**: Run `make dev` to build and deploy changes
4. **View logs**: Use `make dev-logs` to reload and tail logs in real-time

The Docker hot reload workflow:
- Builds a new Docker image with your changes
- Pushes it to the local k3d registry
- Updates the running deployment without cluster restart
- Maintains all existing ECS resources and state


## Architecture Overview

KECS implements a clean architecture with the following key components:

### Dual Server Design
- **API Server (port 8080)**: Handles ECS-compatible API requests at `/v1/<action>` endpoints
- **Admin Server (port 8081)**: Provides operational endpoints like `/health`

### Directory Structure
- `cmd/controlplane/`: Entry point for the control plane binary
- `internal/controlplane/cmd/`: CLI command implementations using Cobra
- `internal/controlplane/api/`: ECS API endpoint implementations
- `internal/controlplane/admin/`: Admin server with health checks
- `internal/converters/`: Task definition to Kubernetes resource converters
- `internal/kubernetes/`: Kubernetes client and resource managers
- `internal/storage/`: Storage interfaces and DuckDB implementation
- `docs/adr/records/`: Architectural Decision Records
- `docs-site/`: VitePress-based documentation site

### API Implementation Pattern
Each ECS resource type has its own file in `internal/controlplane/api/` with:
- Request/Response struct definitions matching AWS ECS API
- Handler function registered in `api/server.go`
- Current implementations return mock responses with TODO comments

### Key Architectural Decisions
- Uses standard `net/http` for HTTP servers
- Graceful shutdown with 10-second timeout
- Context-based cancellation throughout
- DuckDB for persistence (storage layer implemented)
- Kubernetes client for container operations (Kind integration)
- WebSocket support for real-time updates


## Documentation Site

KECS documentation is built using VitePress (SSG - Static Site Generator):

### Documentation Development
```bash
# Install dependencies and start dev server
cd docs-site
npm install
npm run docs:dev  # Access at http://localhost:5173
```

### Documentation Build
```bash
# Build documentation site
./scripts/build-docs.sh  # Output in docs-site/.vitepress/dist/

# Or manually from docs-site directory
cd docs-site && npm run docs:build
```

### Documentation Structure
- `docs-site/`: VitePress documentation root
  - `.vitepress/config.js`: Site configuration
  - `index.md`: Home page
  - `guides/`: User guides and tutorials
  - `api/`: API reference documentation
  - `architecture/`: Architecture documentation
  - `deployment/`: Deployment guides
  - `development/`: Developer documentation

## Development Notes

### Development Workflow Rules
1. **Always create a feature branch before starting implementation work**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/feature-name  # For features
   git checkout -b fix/bug-name       # For bug fixes
   ```

2. **Run all tests before creating a Pull Request**
   ```bash
   # Control plane tests (using Ginkgo)
   cd controlplane && ginkgo -r
   # Or using go test
   cd controlplane && go test ./...
   ```

3. **Only create PR after all tests pass**
   - Control plane unit tests must pass
   - Fix any failing tests before proceeding with PR

4. **Test CI/CD changes locally with act before committing**
   ```bash
   # Test GitHub Actions workflow locally
   act -W .github/workflows/workflow-name.yml -j job-name --container-architecture linux/amd64
   ```
   - ALWAYS verify CI changes work locally before pushing
   - This prevents breaking the CI pipeline for other developers

### When implementing new ECS API endpoints:
1. Add type definitions to the appropriate file in `internal/controlplane/api/`
2. Implement the handler function following existing patterns
3. Register the handler in `api/server.go`
4. Follow AWS ECS API naming conventions exactly
5. Write Ginkgo tests for the new endpoint covering:
   - Success cases
   - Error cases
   - Edge cases (e.g., idempotency, empty inputs)
   - AWS ECS compatibility behavior

### Current Implementation Status
- **Implemented**: Clusters, Services, Tasks, Task Definitions, Tags, Attributes
- **Storage**: DuckDB integration for persistence
- **Kubernetes**: Task converter with secret management
- **Container Commands**: Docker-based background execution with multiple instance support
- **In Progress**: Full Kubernetes task lifecycle management

### Container Commands Implementation
KECS includes Docker container management commands similar to kind/k3d:
- `start`, `stop`, `status`, `logs` commands for container lifecycle
- Multiple instance support with configuration files
- Automatic port conflict detection and resolution
- Data persistence through volume mounts
- See `docs/container-commands.md` for detailed usage

## Scenario Tests

### Running Scenario Tests
```bash
# Navigate to scenario tests directory
cd tests/scenarios

# Run all scenario tests
make test

# Run only cluster tests
make test-cluster

# Run with debug logging
make test-verbose

# Run specific test
make test-one TEST=TestClusterCreateAndDelete
```

### Test Structure
- **Phase 1 (Foundation)**: Basic cluster management tests - COMPLETED
  - Testcontainers integration for isolated test environments
  - AWS CLI wrapper for ECS operations
  - Test helpers and utilities
- **Phase 2**: Task definition and basic service operations
- **Phase 3**: Task lifecycle and status tracking
- **Phase 4**: Advanced service operations (rolling updates, scaling)
- **Phase 5**: Failure scenarios
- **Phase 6**: ecspresso integration
- **Phase 7**: Performance tests
- **Phase 8**: CI/CD integration

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- AWS CLI v2
- Go 1.21+

### Test Implementation Pattern
Scenario tests use standard Go testing with helper utilities:
```go
func TestClusterLifecycle(t *testing.T) {
    // Start KECS container
    kecs := utils.StartKECS(t)
    defer kecs.Cleanup()
    
    // Create ECS client
    client := utils.NewECSClient(kecs.Endpoint())
    
    // Test implementation
    err := client.CreateCluster("test-cluster")
    require.NoError(t, err)
    
    // Assertions
    utils.AssertClusterActive(t, client, "test-cluster")
}
```

## Claude Code Sub-Agents

KECS project includes specialized sub-agents for Claude Code to handle specific tasks:

### greptile-review-resolver
A specialized agent that resolves issues identified by Greptile's automated PR review.

**When to use**: After creating a PR when Greptile has posted review comments that need to be resolved.

**What it does**:
1. Fetches and analyzes all Greptile review comments
2. Categorizes issues by severity (compilation errors, logic issues, style suggestions)
3. Automatically fixes critical compilation errors
4. Creates fix commits with clear messages
5. Documents why certain suggestions were not implemented
6. Creates follow-up issues for deferred improvements

**Example usage**:
```
User: "Greptile found issues in PR #594. Please resolve them."
Assistant: *Launches greptile-review-resolver agent*
Agent: 
- Fetches PR #594 comments
- Identifies 3 compilation errors, 2 logic issues, 4 style suggestions
- Fixes compilation errors (missing methods)
- Fixes critical logic issue (context propagation)
- Creates follow-up issue for refactoring duplicated code
- Commits fixes with message "fix: Resolve Greptile review comments for PR #594"
```

The agent follows the workflow documented in `docs/greptile-workflow.md` and ensures all blocking issues are resolved before the PR can be merged.
