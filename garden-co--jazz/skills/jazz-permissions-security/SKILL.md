# Jazz Permissions & Security

## When to Use This Skill

* Structuring apps for multi-tenant or multi-user collaboration
* Implementing sharing workflows, "Share" buttons, Invite Links, or Team management
* Deciding who should own CoValues
* Debugging "User cannot see data" or "Data is read-only" issues
* Configuring permissions for Server Workers. Remember: Workers are just Accounts; they need to be invited to Groups like any other user

## Do NOT Use This Skill For

* Creating or designing schemas (use the `jazz-schema-design` skill)
* Authentication
* Generic UI component styling

## Key Heuristic for Agents

If a user asks "How do I share X with Y?" or "Why can't I access this?", this is usually a Group Ownership issue.

## Core Concepts

Security is **cryptographic** and **group-based**. Every CoValue has an owner, and access is controlled through Groups. You add users to a **Group**, and that Group owns the CoValues.

**Groups can be members of other groups**, creating hierarchical permission structures with inherited roles.

**Critical Rule:** Just because List A contains a reference to Item B does **NOT** mean readers of List A can see Item B. Item B must be owned by a Group the reader has access to.

## The Ownership Hierarchy

### Private

When creating CoValues without a specified owner, Jazz creates a new Group with the current account as the owner and sole admin member.

**Code:** `MyMap.create({ ... })`

### Shared Data

To share data, you can either create a new Group and add members to it, or use an existing Group with multiple members.

**Code:** `MyMap.create({ ... }, { owner: teamGroup })`

## Roles & Permissions Matrix

Jazz uses fixed roles. You cannot create custom roles.

| Role | Capability | Best For |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| admin | Read, Write, Delete, Invite Members, Revoke Access, Change Roles | Team Owners, Creators |
| manager | Read, Write, Add/Remove readers/writers | Delegated management |
| writer | Read, Write | Collaborators, Team Members |
| reader | Read Only | Observers, Public Links |
| writeOnly | Write Only (Blind submissions) | Voting, Dropboxes |

All users can downgrade themselves or leave a group. Admins cannot be removed/downgraded except by themselves. Managers cannot remove/downgrade each other, but can remove/downgrade lower roles.

**Note:** Only admins can delete CoValues.

## Managing Groups

When assigning roles, you can add *Accounts*, *Groups*, or "everyone". When adding a group, the most permissive role wins for members with multiple entitlements.

```ts
const group = co.group().create();
const bob = await co.account().load(bobsId);

if (bob.$isLoaded) {
  group.addMember(bob, "writer");
  group.addMember(bob, "reader"); // Change role
  group.removeMember(bob);
}
```

## Validating Permissions

```ts
const red = MyCoMap.create({ color: "red" });
const me = co.account().getMe();

if (me.canAdmin(red)) {
  console.log("I can add users of any role");
} else if (me.canManage(red)) {
  console.log("I can share value with others");
} else if (me.canWrite(red)) {
  console.log("I can edit value");
} else if (me.canRead(red)) {
  console.log("I can view value");
}

// Or get role directly
red.$jazz.owner.getRoleOf(me.$jazz.id); // "admin"
```

## Fundamental Patterns

### Pattern 1: Creating Shared Data

**Must** pass the correct owner explicitly to ensure visibility.

```ts
// ❌ WRONG: Defaults to private, other members won't see it
const task = Task.create({ title: "Fix bug" });
project.tasks.push(task);

// ✅ RIGHT: Explicitly set owner
const task = Task.create(
  { title: "Fix bug" },
  { owner: project.$jazz.owner }
);
project.tasks.push(task);

// ✅ ALSO RIGHT: Create new group for independent permissions
const taskGroup = co.group().create();
taskGroup.addMember(project.$jazz.owner, 'writer');
const task = Task.create({ title: "Fix bug" }, { owner: taskGroup });
```

**Note:** Inline creation (passing JSON) automatically handles group inheritance based on schema configuration (default is `extendsContainer`).

You **MUST NOT** use an `Account` as a CoValue owner.

### Pattern 2: The Invite Flow

#### Creating Invite Links

**React:**

```ts
import { createInviteLink } from "jazz-tools/react";
const inviteLink = createInviteLink(organization, "writer");
```

**Svelte:**

```ts
import { createInviteLink } from "jazz-tools/svelte";
const inviteLink = createInviteLink(organization, "writer");
```

Generates URL: `.../#/invite/[CoValue ID]/[inviteSecret]`

#### Accepting Invites

**React:**

```tsx
import { useAcceptInvite } from "jazz-tools/react";

useAcceptInvite({
  invitedObjectSchema: Organization,
  onAccept: async (organizationID) => {
    const organization = await Organization.load(organizationID);
    if (!organization.$isLoaded) throw new Error("Could not load");
    me.root.organizations.$jazz.push(organization);
  },
});
```

**Svelte:**

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { InviteListener } from "jazz-tools/svelte";
  
  new InviteListener({
    invitedObjectSchema: Organization,
    onAccept: async (organizationID) => {
      const organization = await Organization.load(organizationID);
      if (!organization.$isLoaded) throw new Error("Could not load");
      me.current.root.organizations.$jazz.push(organization);
    },
  });
</script>
```

**Programmatic:**

```ts
await account.acceptInvite(organizationId, inviteSecret, Organization);
```

#### Invite Secrets

```ts
const groupToInviteTo = Group.create();
const readerInvite = groupToInviteTo.$jazz.createInvite("reader");
await account.acceptInvite(group.$jazz.id, readerInvite);
```

**⚠️ Security:** Invites do not expire and cannot be revoked. Never pass secrets as route parameters or query strings—only use fragment identifiers (hash in URL).

### Pattern 3: Public Data

"Public" means "readable by anyone who knows the CoValue ID".

```ts
const group = Group.create();
group.addMember("everyone", "writer");
// Or use alias
group.makePublic("writer"); // Defaults to "reader"
```

### Pattern 4: Requesting Invites

Use `writeOnly` role for request lists—users can submit requests but not read others.

```ts
const JoinRequest = co.map({
  account: co.account(),
  status: z.literal(["pending", "approved", "rejected"]),
});

function createRequestsToJoin() {
  const requestsGroup = Group.create();
  requestsGroup.addMember("everyone", "writeOnly");
  return RequestsList.create([], requestsGroup);
}

async function sendJoinRequest(requestsList, account) {
  const request = JoinRequest.create(
    { account, status: "pending" },
    requestsList.$jazz.owner
  );
  requestsList.$jazz.push(request);
}

async function approveJoinRequest(joinRequest, targetGroup) {
  const account = await co.account().load(joinRequest.$jazz.refs.account.id);
  if (account.$isLoaded) {
    targetGroup.addMember(account, "reader");
    joinRequest.$jazz.set("status", "approved");
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```

### Pattern 5: Cascading Permissions (Groups as Members)

Groups can be added as members of other groups, creating hierarchies.

```ts
const playlistGroup = Group.create();
const trackGroup = Group.create();
trackGroup.addMember(playlistGroup);
```

When you add groups as members:

* Permissions are granted indirectly
* Roles are inherited (except `writeOnly`)
* Revoking access from member group removes access to container group

**Warning:** Deep nesting can cause performance issues.

#### Role Inheritance Rules

**Most Permissive Role Wins:**

```ts
const addedGroup = Group.create();
addedGroup.addMember(bob, "reader");

const containingGroup = Group.create();
containingGroup.addMember(bob, "writer");
containingGroup.addMember(addedGroup);
// Bob stays writer (higher than inherited reader)
```

#### Overriding Roles

```ts
const organizationGroup = Group.create();
organizationGroup.addMember(bob, "admin");

const billingGroup = Group.create();
billingGroup.addMember(organizationGroup, "reader");
// All org members get reader access to billing, regardless of org role
```

#### Other Operations

```ts
// Remove group
containingGroup.removeMember(addedGroup);

// Get parent groups
containingGroup.getParentGroups(); // [addedGroup]
```

#### Inline CoValue Creation

Jazz automatically manages group ownership for nested CoValues:

```ts
const board = Board.create({
  title: "My board",
  columns: [["Task 1.1", "Task 1.2"], ["Task 2.1", "Task 2.2"]],
});
```

Each column and task gets a new group that inherits from the referencing CoValue's owner.

#### Example: Team Hierarchy

```ts
const companyGroup = Group.create();
companyGroup.addMember(CEO, "admin");

const teamGroup = Group.create();
teamGroup.addMember(companyGroup);
teamGroup.addMember(teamLead, "admin");
teamGroup.addMember(developer, "writer");

const projectGroup = Group.create();
projectGroup.addMember(teamGroup);
projectGroup.addMember(client, "reader");
```

## Troubleshooting

### "User cannot see data"
1. **Verify Ownership**: Is the CoValue owned by the expected Group? Check `$jazz.owner`.
2. **Verify Membership**: Is the target user a member of that Group?
3. **Check References**: Does the user have a way to discover the ID (e.g. through a reference in their account root)?

### "Data is read-only"
1. **Check Role**: Use `red.$jazz.owner.getRoleOf(me.$jazz.id)` to check the actual role. `reader` cannot write.

### Cascading Issues
1. **Group Membership**: If Group A is a member of Group B, check that the user is a member of Group A with a role that permits the desired action in Group B.
2. **Unsupported Roles**: Remember `writeOnly` does not cascade.

## Quick Reference

**Ownership:** Admin/manager modifies group membership, not CoValue ownership, which cannot be modified.

**Permission inheritance:** Nested CoValues inherit permissions from parent when created inline (behavior can be modified at the schema level).

**Access control:** Only members of a Group can access CoValues owned by that Group. References alone don't grant access.

**Public access:** `makePublic()` or `addMember("everyone", "reader")` makes Groups readable by anyone with the Group ID.

**Invite links:** `createInviteLink()` generates shareable URLs. Accept with `useAcceptInvite()` (React), `InviteListener` (Svelte) or `account.acceptInvite()`.

**Invite security:** Never pass secrets as route parameters/query strings. Only use fragment identifiers.

**Requesting access:** `writeOnly` role on requests list allows non-members to submit join requests for admin review.

**Cascading:** Groups can be members of other groups. Roles inherit (admin, manager, writer, reader), but `writeOnly` doesn't. Most permissive role wins. Use `getParentGroups()` to inspect hierarchy.
