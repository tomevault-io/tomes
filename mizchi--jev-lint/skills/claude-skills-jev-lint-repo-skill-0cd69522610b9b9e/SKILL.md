description: Use when changing jev-lint ITSELF — editing src/, shipped rule suites under rules/<language>/<id>/, or recorded runs in docs/data/. Complements the user-facing `jev-lint` skill with the maintainer loop: fixtures, labels, calibration, CI, replay. Not for using jev-lint on another project.

# Maintaining jev-lint

The user-facing skill (`skills/jev-lint/`, symlinked into `.claude/skills/`)
is the contract; this file is what is different when the repository is
jev-lint's own. Read `docs/internal.md` before editing `src/`.
The symlink is checked by `npm run ci`; run `just skills-sync` if it is missing.

## The loop

```bash
npm test                                   # no key, no network
npm run ci                                 # typecheck, test, build, eval --replay
node --experimental-strip-types src/cli.ts eval rules/<language>/<id> --repeat 3   # one suite, then --accept
node --experimental-strip-types src/cli.ts check --dry-run    # self-lint plan, via .jev-lint.yaml
node --experimental-strip-types src/cli.ts review --base main --retry 3
```

`.jev-lint.yaml` here points at source, tests, docs, and `package.json`,
and excludes `test/fixtures/`, which holds planted defects for the cookbook.

## Rules and their evals

- A rule is `rules/<language>/<id>/rule.yml` with `fixtures/`, `expect.yml`
  (labelled defects and cleans), and an accepted `baseline.json` beside it.
  `last.json` is untracked. `jev-lint eval rules/<language>/<id> --repeat 3`
  runs it; `--accept` promotes the
  run; `npm run ci` ends in `jev-lint eval --replay`, which fails on a case
  that was right when accepted and is wrong now, or on a rule whose question
  changed since its baseline. The case files carry NO `// DEFECT` /
  `// CLEAN` markers: those sat inside the file the model was shown, and the
  fits they produced were better than the rules (six fell when they came
  out). Editing a case file means shifting the labels below the edit; the
  test suite fails on a label no subject sits on.
- Each suite labels only its own rule. `tools/arms.ts` and
  `tools/grouping.ts` run every rule over every suite's cases
  (`evalCorpus`), where another rule's answer on a suite's file is clean by
  default -- a defect for rule A in rule B's cases is B's false positive
  until labelled.
- A fixture file named for the rule it exercises carries
  `// jev-lint-ignore-file module-name-describes-contents` on line 1, above
  its imports, so the module rule does not judge a name that was never a
  claim about the exports.
- A new shipped rule needs its own fixtures with hard cleans, `gaps`,
  repeated `eval`, a report with a verdict, and a pass over unseen code
  before it enters `rules/<language>/<id>/` with an accepted baseline.
- Any change to a shipped rule's `ask`, `criteria`, `note`, matcher,
  `subject` or `state` is a new question: `jev-lint eval --replay` refuses
  the old baseline until you run `jev-lint eval rules/<language>/<id> --repeat 3`,
  read the result, and `--accept` it. Commit the baseline with the rule.
- `tools/arms.ts` measures every arm per rule over every suite's cases
  (five arms, two passes, about twenty cents). Re-run it after changing a matcher or splitting a rule; the
  shipped `state:` choices are measurements, not preferences.
- Figures quoted in `README.md`, `docs/reference.md` and `docs/deepdive.md`
  are measured. Change the measurement and the figure together, or neither.

## Plugin

The repository root is a Claude Code plugin (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`,
`skills/`, `commands/`). Every YAML block in
`skills/jev-lint/references/cookbook.md` must load and match
`test/fixtures/cookbook/`; `npm test` asserts it. A new recipe needs its code
shape added to the fixture.
