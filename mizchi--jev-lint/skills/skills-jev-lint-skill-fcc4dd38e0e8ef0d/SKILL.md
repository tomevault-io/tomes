name: jev-lint
description: Use when running jev-lint, adding it to a repository or its CI, choosing which of its shipped rule packs to use, writing a new jev-lint rule (an ast-grep matcher plus one sentence a model judges), or calibrating a rule's cutoff. Triggers: `jev-lint`, `.jev-lint.yaml`, a `.jev-lint/rules/*.yml` or `rules/*.yml` file with `ask:` in it, questions like 'lint whether function names match their bodies' or 'find comments that are no longer true', and any request to check code for something a conventional linter cannot decide. Also use it before claiming a jev-lint rule 'works' — this skill defines what that requires.

# jev-lint

A linter whose rules are sentences. An [ast-grep](https://ast-grep.github.io)
matcher decides **which code is looked at**; one sentence decides **whether it
is a problem**; a model ([Jev](https://typesafe.ai)) answers the sentence for
every match, batched per file. It finds what no parser can: a function whose
body does something other than its name promises, a comment that became false,
a test that would pass if the behaviour it names were broken.

| | who does it | how it fails |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rule:` | ast-grep — exact, free, local | **silently**: a node it misses is never asked about |
| `ask:` | the model, once per match | loudly: every answer is visible in `jev-lint gaps` |

Knowing which half you are working on is most of the job.

## Non-negotiables

1. **Never write a rule a compiler, type checker or conventional linter can
   decide.** The model is good at code that *contradicts a contract it declares
   about itself* and measurably poor at defects needing knowledge of a specific
   API (that `.sort()` is lexicographic). Those belong to the existing tools.
2. **Never ask for something the matched code cannot show.** The most common
   way a rule fails, and it looks exactly like a threshold problem: every answer
   lands mid-scale and no cutoff separates. Check `subject` and `state` before
   touching the wording.
3. **Never put a threshold in the sentence.** The cutoff is `threshold:`; baking it
   into the question means every recalibration rewrites the question.
4. **The API key lives in the environment** (`TYPESAFE_API_KEY`), never in
   `.jev-lint.yaml`, which belongs in version control. `apiKey:` in the file
   is a hard error.
5. **A finding is a candidate for a human, not a verdict.** Measured on real
   code about one finding in five was wrong. Read each against the code.
6. **Record any run you draw a conclusion from** (`--record r.json`).
   `jev-lint replay r.json` re-scores it under new cutoffs with no API key,
   so a cutoff stays auditable.

## Which task is this?

| you want to | read |
| --- | --- |
| run it, add it to CI, tune output | this file, next section |
| use the rules that ship with it, pick some, adjust a cutoff | [references/using-shipped-rules.md](references/using-shipped-rules.md) |
| write a rule in your own TypeScript, custom-grammar, Text, or Git repository | [references/writing-project-rules.md](references/writing-project-rules.md), then [references/cookbook.md](references/cookbook.md) |
| know what every field means, `score` vs `noul`, the `state` arms | [references/rule-fields.md](references/rule-fields.md) |
| fit a cutoff, build a rule's evals, judge whether a rule works | [references/calibration.md](references/calibration.md) |
| judge commit messages against their diffs, or a change against the repository's own AGENTS.md | `jev-lint commits`, below |
| install it as a git hook, and know what blocks a commit | [../../docs/use-hooks.md](../../docs/use-hooks.md) |

## Running it

```bash
export TYPESAFE_API_KEY=...            # or TYPESAFEAI_API_KEY
npx -y jev-lint check src --dry-run    # plan and price. Makes NO request.
npx -y jev-lint check src              # judge whole files
npx -y jev-lint run fn-name-promises src        # one shipped rule; rust/<id> for one language
npx -y jev-lint run --file myrule.yml src       # a rule file of your own, and nothing else
npx -y jev-lint review --base main     # judge only what the diff touched
npx -y jev-lint commits --base main    # judge each commit's message against its diff,
                                       #   and each change against AGENTS.md (CLAUDE.md fallback)
npx -y jev-lint commits --staged       # the same, on what is about to be committed
npx -y jev-lint init                   # write .jev-lint.yaml: files, and every shipped rule on
npx -y jev-lint rules                  # what loaded, and every validation error
```

Run `--dry-run` first, always: it prints subject count, request count and the
price without spending anything. Then `review`, not `check`, for anything
routine — review mode keeps only matches whose subject overlaps a changed line,
which is where findings concentrate and costs a fraction of a cent.

```bash
jev-lint review --base "$GITHUB_BASE_REF" --format github   # in CI
jev-lint init --pre-commit      # hook: review --staged + commits --staged, on every commit
jev-lint init --pre-push        # hook: commits @{upstream}..HEAD --fail-on error, before every push
jev-lint check src --retry 3                                 # decide on the mean of 3 passes
jev-lint check src --threshold typescript/fn-name-promises=0.8     # override one cutoff for one run
jev-lint check src -R my-rules.yml -R rules                  # rule sources, repeatable
```

Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` findings, `2` configuration error, `3` requests
failed. Any finding exits 1 unless `--fail-on <severity>` raises the bar;
`--format github` annotates `warning` unless the rule says `severity:
error`, and no shipped rule does. The pre-commit hook `init --pre-commit`
writes uses `--fail-on error`, so no *finding* blocks a commit until a rule
has earned `error`; without a key in the environment it steps aside. It runs
**two** questions about what is staged -- `review --staged` for the file
rules, then `commits --staged` for `subject: change` rules, which is where
`git/diff-follows-instructions` judges the diff against the repository's own
AGENTS.md, or CLAUDE.md when absent. A failed request exits 3, and git fails a hook on any
non-zero exit, so the shipped bodies let 3 through deliberately: being unable
to commit while offline is how a hook gets deleted rather than fixed. Both
bodies are tracked at `.jev-lint/hooks/<name>`, reviewable like any other
file, with a shim in git's hooks directory that finds and runs them --
[../../docs/use-hooks.md](../../docs/use-hooks.md). `--staged` reviews what the commit will contain: no untracked files,
no unstaged edits, though a partially staged file is judged as it is on disk.
When paths are configured or given, `review` scans only the changed files
under them, never the whole tree.

**Settings**: `.jev-lint.yaml` (or `jev-lint.yaml`, `.jevlint.yml`, any spelling; two in one directory is an error), nearest one searching upwards, a flag beats
it. `languages:` declares a grammar ast-grep does not have built in (a
tree-sitter parser compiled to a dynamic library — see
[the reference](../../docs/reference.md#a-language-ast-grep-does-not-have-built-in);
MoonBit is measured there). `files:` there lets `jev-lint check` take no argument; `rules:` picks the
rules, ESLint-style — `fn-name-promises: on`, `rust/fn-name-promises: off`,
`comment-describes-block: { threshold: 0.7, severity: error }` — from the shipped
packs and the project's own `.jev-lint/rules/`; a config with no `rules:`
runs nothing. Unknown keys are errors. A `-R` run inside a repository that
has a config still merges that config — its `rules:`, its `files:` — so pass
**`--no-config`** when testing a rule in isolation, and **`--cache none`** so
no earlier verdict is reused (the cache is `.jev-lint/baseline.json`; `-c
<path>` names another).

`hooks.precommit` can select a separate rule set for `review --staged` and
`commits --staged`. `extends: true` inherits top-level `rules:` and applies
the hook entries over it; `extends: false` uses only hook entries. Without the
section, staged runs use top-level `rules:`. See
[the hook guide](../../docs/use-hooks.md#pre-commit).

**Two output lines that are never noise:**

- **`N rules matched nothing`** — the only place a dead matcher is visible.
  On a TypeScript-only repository the seven Rust variants land here; anything
  else there is a matcher to look at.
- **`N without a verdict`** — requests failed. A run with failures never reads
  as a clean repository.

**Silencing** — any comment syntax, first thing on its line:

```ts
// jev-lint-ignore-next-line fn-name-promises, var-name-describes-value
// jev-lint-ignore-file
```

A suppressed subject is never sent, so it also saves its tokens; every run
prints how many were skipped, and calls out a suppression naming a rule id
that does not exist.

**`--retry n`** asks everything n times and decides on the mean, printing
`3/3 passes` or `1/3 passes` per finding. Use it near a cutoff: pass-to-pass
spread has a median of 0.01 but a maximum of 0.30. It bypasses the verdict
cache and costs n times the tokens. (`-r` is retry; `-R` is rules.)

## Writing a rule in a project

Use [writing-project-rules.md](references/writing-project-rules.md) for the
rule's location and the steps for a built-in grammar, a custom parser, a
Text block, or a Git change. It links the validated
[cookbook](references/cookbook.md), the [field reference](references/rule-fields.md),
and the [calibration procedure](references/calibration.md). Keep the
`--dry-run --show-subjects` matcher check separate from the paid, labelled
evaluation; a guessed `threshold:` is not a calibrated rule.

## Judging the output

When you disagree with a finding it is one of three things, and only the third
means the tool is wrong:

1. **The rule is right and the code is wrong.** Most often. Fix the code.
2. **The rule is right and the *name* is wrong.** A test called "no batch
   exceeds the ceiling" whose body legitimately exempts one-subject batches is
   a name that overclaims. Fix the name.
3. **The rule is wrong.** Add the case to the rule's `fixtures/` as a
   labelled clean example in `expect.yml`, run the eval, and refit. A false positive that
   is not in the evals comes back.

Do not chase the tail: editing a file moves the `located` state for every
subject in it, so a fix can move unrelated verdicts. Fix what you agree with,
re-measure with `--retry 3`, and record the residue rather than iterating
against noise.
