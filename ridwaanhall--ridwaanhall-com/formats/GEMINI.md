# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Stack

Django 6.0 (Python 3.14+), managed with **uv** (not pip/poetry — always `uv sync` / `uv run ...`), Tailwind CSS v4 via CLI, deployed to Vercel (WSGI). Project package is `FlexForge/`; apps live under `apps/`. Database and media storage are both Supabase (Postgres + Storage) in production; SQLite is used automatically in development/tests.

## Commands

- Install deps: `uv sync`
- Dev server: `uv run python manage.py runserver`
- Tests: `uv run python manage.py test` (e.g. `uv run python manage.py test apps.blog` for one app) — this is what CI runs and is the canonical command. The README also mentions `uv run pytest`; pytest-django is configured and works, but CI does not use it.
- Django check: `uv run python manage.py check`
- Tailwind build: `npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./static/css/input.css -o ./staticfiles/css/global-wvbpenzt.css --minify` (add `--watch` for dev). There is no `collectstatic` step anywhere in this project's pipeline (not in CI, not in the Vercel build) — the built `staticfiles/` output (images, fonts, icons, compiled CSS, JS) is committed directly and served as-is. This is why `STORAGES["staticfiles"]` uses WhiteNoise's plain `CompressedStaticFilesStorage`, **not** `CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage`: none of these pre-built assets live under any `STATICFILES_DIRS` source `collectstatic` could discover (they're placed directly under `STATIC_ROOT`), so a manifest can never be generated for them — `ManifestStaticFilesStorage`'s strict lookup would 500 on every `{% static %}` tag referencing one (this was a real, live bug on the `main` branch — every page extending `templates/base_seo.html` 500'd via its favicon links). If you add a genuinely new static asset with a `{% static %}` reference, just drop the file under `staticfiles/` directly with its final name (matching the hand-picked cache-busted filename convention below) — don't reach for `collectstatic`.

## Architecture: Django ORM (Supabase-backed)

Content (bio, experience, projects, blog posts, education, awards, applications, hiring/open-to-work status, privacy policy) lives as real Django models — `apps/about/models.py`, `apps/blog/models.py`, `apps/projects/models.py`, `apps/openhire/models.py`, `apps/core/models.py` (`PrivacyPolicy`) — backed by Postgres (Supabase in prod, SQLite in dev/tests). This replaced an earlier "Individual File System" (dataclasses in per-app `data/` files, no DB) — that whole layer (`apps/*/data/`, `apps/core/dynamic_loader.py`) was migrated and removed; don't recreate it.

- **Access pattern preserved on purpose**: `apps/core/data_service.py`'s `DataService`, `apps/about/manager.py`'s `AboutManager`, `apps/core/content_manager.py`'s `ContentManager`, and `apps/openhire/manager.py`'s `OpenHireManager` are the only things views/templates/`apps/seo/schema.py` talk to. They query the ORM internally but hand back the exact same plain `dict`/`list[dict]` shapes the old dataclass files produced (including derived fields like `image_url`/`img_name`/`image_count` on blog/project dicts, built by `apps/core/content_manager.py`'s `_add_image_compat_fields`). Extend these managers rather than querying models directly from views, and preserve the dict shape when you do.
- **Singletons** (`Profile`, `HiringProfile`, `OpenToWorkProfile`, `PrivacyPolicy`) extend `apps/core/models.py`'s `SingletonModel` (forces `pk=1`, blocks delete) and use `.load()` (get-or-create) rather than a plain query.
- **Slugs are computed, not stored data**: `BlogPost.slug`/`Project.slug` are `slugify(title)`, resolved via `apps/core/base_views.py`'s `DetailView.get_item_by_slug(queryset, slug, to_dict_fn)` — an indexed DB lookup (`get_object_or_404`), not a linear scan.
- **Ordered M2M**: `Profile.skills_highlight` goes through `ProfileSkillHighlight` (profile, skill, `order`) because the sequence is editorial — it becomes the JSON-LD `knowsAbout` array. Read it via `profile.skill_highlights` (prefetch `skill_highlights__skill`), never the bare M2M, which returns `Skill.Meta.ordering` (pk) order. A through model rules out `filter_horizontal` (`admin.E013`), so the admin uses a `TabularInline` with `autocomplete_fields`. `Project.tech_stack` stays a plain M2M with `filter_horizontal` — its order genuinely doesn't matter. Note Django cannot `AlterField` a M2M's `through=`; changing one needs `RemoveField` + `AddField` with the data copied out first.
- **Images**: `ImageField`s use `FileSystemStorage` (local `media/`, gitignored) when `DEBUG`/tests, and a custom Supabase Storage backend (`apps/core/storage.py`'s `SupabaseStorage`) in production — chosen by `STORAGES["default"]` in `FlexForge/settings.py`, mirroring the `DATABASES` sqlite/Postgres split. This is deliberate: local dev works fully offline and never pollutes the shared production bucket with test uploads. `SupabaseStorage` talks directly to Supabase's Storage REST API with `requests` (deliberately not django-storages/boto3, to stay well under Vercel's `maxLambdaSize: 15mb`). It overrides `generate_filename`/`get_available_name` to sidestep two real bugs: Django's base `Storage` methods route file paths through `os.path.join`/`os.path.normpath`, which inject backslashes on Windows dev machines and corrupt the object key; and the default exists-check-and-rename collision avoidance is pointless here since uploads are upsert-safe (`x-upsert: true`) — both are overridden to keep names deterministic and forward-slash-only regardless of host OS. Skill icons stay plain URL strings (not `ImageField`) since they're static SVGs and Pillow can't validate SVG anyway.
- **Admin** (`apps/*/admin.py`) is fully registered — `path('admin/', admin.site.urls)` lives in `FlexForge/urls.py` (it wasn't wired in at all before this existed; don't assume admin is reachable just because models are registered — check both).
- **Stored files are reference-counted, never blindly deleted**: `apps/core/file_cleanup.py` + the `pre_save`/`post_save`/`post_delete` receivers in `apps/core/signals.py` remove a file from Supabase Storage (or local `media/`) when a row is deleted or its image replaced — but only once *no* row on *any* model still names it. That check is essential, not defensive: several files are deliberately shared (the author photo is on all 20 `BlogPost` rows plus `Profile`, one logo covers six `Experience` rows), so per-row deletion would break live images. Cleanup failures are logged, never raised — an orphaned object beats a 500 on the page that triggered it. Note `QuerySet.update()`/`bulk_create` bypass signals, so bulk edits won't clean up.
- **`SupabaseStorage.delete()` must treat "missing" as success**: Supabase reports a missing object as HTTP **400** with a body of `{"statusCode": "404", "code": "NoSuchKey"}`, *not* a plain 404, so status alone can't identify it — and Django's `Storage.delete()` contract says deleting a missing file is not an error.
- **Row Level Security**: Supabase exposes a PostgREST API over the `public` schema to anyone holding the project's anon/service keys, entirely independent of Django. `apps/core/signals.py`'s `enable_row_level_security` runs on every `post_migrate` (Postgres only, idempotent) and force-enables RLS on every public table — this has zero effect on Django's own queries since its Postgres role has `BYPASSRLS`, but closes the PostgREST exposure. Don't disable this; if a table shows RLS off in the Supabase dashboard, `manage.py migrate` hasn't run since it was disabled — re-run `migrate` to restore it.

## Admin: JSON fields get structured editors, never a raw JSON textarea

Semi-structured content (`stories`, `responsibilities`, `achievements`, `tags`, `Project.description`, the 14 openhire lists, all 10 privacy-policy sections, `BlogPost.content`) stays stored as `models.JSONField`, but the admin never shows raw JSON. `apps/core/admin_widgets.py` provides five Field/Widget pairs — `StringListField`, `KeyValueField`, `GroupedKeyValueField`, `CopyrightCreditsField`, `ContentBlockField` — and `apps/core/admin_forms.py`'s `string_list_form()` builds a `ModelForm` for the common all-string-lists case in one line. When adding a JSON field, wire it to one of these rather than leaving the default textarea.

- **Declare fields on a `ModelForm`, not via `formfield_overrides`** — the latter maps a whole field *class* to one widget, which can't express `BlogPost` (`content` vs `tags`) or `PrivacyPolicy` (three shapes across ten columns).
- **For an inline, pass `exclude=(<parent fk>,)`** to `string_list_form()`. `fields = "__all__"` otherwise pulls the parent FK in as a required select and *no save can succeed* (this bit `PositionInline`).
- **One named control, name-less UI.** Each widget renders a single `<textarea name="…">` holding the JSON; `staticfiles/js/adminJsonWidgets.js` hides it and builds the editor from name-less elements, mutating the parsed model in place. Don't "improve" this into one named input per item: a `<textarea>`'s submission value is CRLF-normalised (which would corrupt the one `pre` block containing real newlines), `construct_instance` would silently keep the old value when you clear a list, and `inlines.js`'s `__prefix__` renumbering would have N names and duplicate ids to rewrite. It also degrades to the old raw-JSON textarea when JS is unavailable.
- **`has_changed` must treat `initial=None` as the shape's zero value**, or every blank "add another" inline row counts as changed, gets fully validated, and blocks the page from saving. Formsets gate both `save_existing()` and new-row creation on `has_changed`.
- **No key-reorder controls on dict editors.** Production is Postgres `jsonb`, which normalises object key order — such a control would appear to work on SQLite locally and be a silent no-op live. List order *is* preserved by jsonb, so list reordering is real and supported.
- **Never trim or normalise values.** Two stored `class` strings contain double spaces, and block `text` is raw HTML rendered `|safe`. Widget JS uses `document.createElement` + `el.value = …`, never `innerHTML`.
- Widget templates live in `apps/core/templates/core/widgets/` — the default `FORM_RENDERER` searches app `templates/` dirs (`django/forms/renderers.py`), so no settings change is needed. Assets go straight into `staticfiles/js|css/` per the convention above, and `class Media` deliberately does **not** list jQuery (admin loads `jquery.js` in DEBUG vs `jquery.min.js` otherwise; declaring it double-loads and breaks `noConflict`).
- When changing any of this, re-run the fidelity checks: `apps/core/tests.py`'s `AdminJSONWidgetRoundTripTest`, and a GET-then-POST-unchanged pass over the admin change forms — that combination is what catches CRLF corruption, silent field drops, and `has_changed` regressions, none of which unit tests alone reveal.

## Content caching

Page latency is dominated by **round trips to Supabase**, not by query complexity — measured against the live database, opening a connection costs ~190ms and each subsequent query ~27ms, so a page issuing sixteen queries spent almost all its time waiting on the network. `apps/core/cache.py` caches what the managers return, which took the nine main pages from **84 queries / 2.6s to 3 queries / 245ms**.

The design has to work on Vercel, where each lambda has its own memory and an admin edit handled by one instance must not leave the others serving stale content. Two concerns are kept separate:

- **Payloads live in local process memory** (`CACHES["default"]` is `LocMemCache` in every environment). A hit costs no network and no Supabase quota.
- **Correctness is anchored by a shared version stamp** per namespace, in `apps.core.models.ContentVersion` (one tiny Postgres table). A payload's cache key embeds the versions of the namespaces it was built from, so bumping one instantly orphans every key derived from it — on all instances at once, with no cross-instance messaging. Reading the stamps is a single indexed query, itself memoised locally for `CONTENT_CACHE_VERSION_TTL` (default 5s), so a warm page issues **zero** queries.

`CONTENT_CACHE_VERSION_TTL` is the only staleness window in the design: it bounds how long an instance that *didn't* handle an edit keeps serving the old content. The instance that did handle it drops its memo in `invalidate()`, so the admin shows changes immediately.

- **Invalidation is per namespace, never global.** `MODEL_NAMESPACES` maps each model to a namespace and `ENTRY_DEPENDENCIES` declares what each cached entry is built from; the `post_save`/`post_delete`/`m2m_changed` receivers in `apps/core/signals.py` bump only the affected ones. Saving a blog post must not throw away the projects, about and privacy caches — each costs a fresh set of round trips to rebuild. Listing a dependency that isn't real only causes an occasional needless rebuild; *omitting* a real one serves stale content, so err towards listing it (`projects` depends on `skill` because project dicts embed whole `tech_stack` records, and `about_data` does too because it embeds highlighted skill *names*).
- **`m2m_changed` is not optional.** `Project.tech_stack` is a plain M2M, so attaching a skill fires `post_save` on neither side.
- **Values derived from the clock must not be cached.** `AboutManager.get_about_data()` recomputes `is_active` (`is_working_hours()`, Asia/Jakarta) on every read rather than serving the cached copy, or the availability indicator would freeze. The homepage's shuffled skill rows are built in the view from cached data, so they still vary per request.
- **`CONTENT_CACHE_TTL` (default 900s) is a safety net, not the invalidation mechanism.** `QuerySet.update()` and `bulk_create()` bypass signals and so never bump a version — the blog detail view's `F("views") + 1` increment is exactly such a write.
- **The cache is off under `manage.py test`** (`CONTENT_CACHE_ENABLED = False` when `TESTING`), so the suite observes writes immediately and its `assertNumQueries` counts stay meaningful; disabling short-circuits `get_or_build` before it reads any stamp, so no query is added either. `apps/core/tests/test_content_cache.py` turns it back on and is the only place the caching is actually exercised — if you change any of this, that module is what catches it.
- **Detail pages resolve slugs against the cached list** via `DetailView.find_by_slug()`, not a fresh `get_object_or_404`: the full post/project list is already in memory, so re-querying a row we're holding buys nothing but a round trip. `get_item_by_slug()` (the indexed-lookup version) is still there for callers that genuinely need a queryset.
- A missing/unreadable `ContentVersion` table degrades to *uncached*, never to a 500 — `_load_versions()` returns `None` and `get_or_build` just calls the builder. A failed version bump is logged and swallowed so it can't break the save that triggered it.

`CONN_MAX_AGE` is set to 600 (was 0) with `CONN_HEALTH_CHECKS=True`, so a warm instance stops paying the ~190ms connection handshake on every request. This is the intended usage of the transaction-mode pooler — a client connection to pgbouncer is cheap, since a real server connection is only claimed for the duration of a transaction.

**Gotcha: Supabase Storage reads are CDN-fronted and only eventually consistent.** Replacing an object at the *same* key can serve the previous bytes for a while (observed as `CF-Cache-Status: HIT` returning superseded content, on both the public and the authenticated endpoint). A freshly-created key is immediately consistent, so this only bites when re-uploading an image under a filename that already existed — `SupabaseStorage.get_available_name()` is deliberately deterministic, so that *is* an in-place replace. Upload under a new filename when you need the change visible immediately. `_open()` uses the authenticated object endpoint rather than the public URL, which at least keeps server-side reads off the public-bucket path, but it does not defeat the CDN.

## View pattern

Views inherit from `apps/core/base_views.py`'s `BaseView`/`PaginatedView`/`DetailView` and implement `_get(self, request, *args, **kwargs)`, not `get()` — `BaseView.get()` already wraps `_get` in `handle_exceptions` for consistent error pages across the app. Only override `get()` directly for views with fundamentally different behavior (e.g. the CV redirect views in `apps/core/views.py`). `BaseView.get_about_data()` caches its result on the view instance (`self._about_data_cache`) since several views/SEO mixins call it more than once per request — that used to be free (static in-memory data) and is now a real ORM query, so don't remove the cache without checking query counts.

`apps/projects/types/project.py` still has `ProjectStatus`/`PROJECT_STATUS_SORT_RANK`/`normalize_project_status` (pure lifecycle-status logic, no DB dependency) — everything else that used to live under `apps/*/types/` (the old IFS dataclasses) is gone.

## Guestbook chat messages

`apps/guestbook/templates/guestbook/guestbook.html` renders new messages twice over: once server-side in `apps/guestbook/templates/guestbook/sections/guestbook_messages.html` (initial page load), and once as a hand-built JS template-string literal in `guestbook.html`'s inline `<script>` (for the AJAX-posted message shown without a reload). Any change to how a message is displayed — badges, pin state, link rendering — must be made in **both** places or new messages will render inconsistently until the next page load.

Message text rendering (both places) checks for a `https://` prefix and renders the whole message as a link instead of escaped text: the `linkify_message` filter in `apps/guestbook/templatetags/guestbook_tags.py` server-side, and the `linkifyMessage()` JS function (same logic, kept in sync manually) client-side.

Pinning is a toggle, not separate pin/unpin endpoints: `PinMessageView` (`apps/guestbook/views.py`) flips `ChatMessage.is_pinned` and enforces `ChatMessage.MAX_PINNED_MESSAGES` (3) only on the pin path. `UserProfileMixin.get_user_profile_data()`'s `can_pin` field (`is_author or is_co_author`) is the single source of truth for pin permission — reuse it rather than re-deriving from `is_author`/`is_co_author` separately. On successful pin, the JSON response includes full profile data (`user`, `message`, `profile_image`, `is_author`, `is_co_author`) so the client can build the pinned card without re-querying — the JS `addPinnedCard()` and Python `enriched_pinned_messages` (in `GuestbookView._get`) must stay shaped the same way. `guestbook.html` has `buildRoleBadgeHtml()`/`buildPinnedAvatarHtml()` JS helpers specifically to avoid a third hand-copy of that markup — reuse them instead of inlining more badge/avatar HTML strings. Pinned message text uses `line-clamp-2` with a JS-driven "Read more" toggle (`checkPinnedReadMore()`, shown only when the text is actually clamped) rather than `truncate`, so the full message stays reachable.

### Merging guestbook history from another database

`manage.py sync_guestbook --source-dsn "postgres://…" [--dry-run]` merges users and messages in from a second Postgres database. Written for the Neon→Supabase cutover (the live site kept writing to Neon after the initial copy, so a few rows only ever existed there), but it is a general, re-runnable **merge**, not a restore — rows already present are left alone and rows created on the target since the cutover are never touched. Four constraints are load-bearing and easy to undo by accident:

- **Match on a natural key `(username, message.strip(), timestamp truncated to the second)`, never the pk.** Both databases independently issued the same ids to different rows, so a source pk is meaningless on the target — the command reassigns pks on insert and resolves `reply_to` by natural key too. The second-level truncation is not sloppiness: the original copy went through a JSON `dumpdata` round-trip that dropped sub-second precision, so the two sides genuinely disagree below the second (`…431379` vs `…431000`).
- **`post_save` notifications are disconnected for the duration** (restored in a `finally`). Copied messages are historical; letting the receiver run emails their authors, the site owner, and everyone they replied to about conversations from days ago. This is the same hazard as the `raw` guard above, but `loaddata`'s `raw=True` doesn't apply here since these are ordinary saves.
- **Copy the `SocialAccount` alongside the user**, or their next OAuth sign-in creates a *second* account instead of matching the one just copied.
- **Sequences are reset afterwards** (Postgres only) — anything loaded earlier with explicit ids leaves the sequence behind the max pk, and the next live message insert then collides.

`apps/guestbook/tests/test_sync_guestbook.py` covers all of these with a stubbed source connection (offline, no credentials needed).

## Gotcha: email templates don't use Django's template engine

Files under `apps/core/templates/core/email/` are rendered by `EmailTemplateLoader._render_template()` (`apps/core/email_templates.py`) via plain `str.replace()` on literal `{{ key }}` tokens — **not** `django.template`. `{% %}` tags do nothing there (silently left as literal text), and any `{{ key }}` not present in the calling method's context dict is left unreplaced in the sent email rather than raising an error. When adding a placeholder to a template, add the matching key to that method's `context` dict in `email_templates.py` in the same change, and verify by rendering (no automated test covers these). All five template pairs (contact/guestbook notification, autoreply, reply-notification — html+txt each) share one dark palette (`#09090b` canvas, `#18181b` card, `#6366f1` indigo accent) matching the site's own `bg-black`/zinc/indigo theme — keep new templates visually consistent with that rather than introducing another palette.

## Gotcha: `{% block head_seo %}` only renders when `seo` is missing from context

`templates/base_seo.html` falls back to `{% block head_seo %}` only in the `{% else %}` branch of `{% if seo %}`. Every view built on `apps/seo/mixins.py`'s `SEOMixin` unconditionally sets `context['seo']`, so `head_seo` never renders for those pages — don't add page-specific meta/JSON-LD there; extend `apps/seo/schema.py`'s `SEOSchemaGenerator` and wire it into `apps/seo/manager.py` instead, matching how existing pages do it.

## Gotcha: hardcoded compiled CSS filename

The compiled Tailwind output filename (currently `global-wvbpenzt.css`) is a hand-picked string, not an auto-generated hash. It's hardcoded in three places that must stay in sync:

1. The Tailwind CLI `-o` path (above)
2. `templates/base_seo.html`
3. `templates/error.html`

Renaming it requires updating all three plus regenerating/removing the old file under `staticfiles/css/`.

## Gotcha: `STORAGES` setting fully replaces, not merges

`FlexForge/settings.py`'s `STORAGES` dict must declare both `"default"` (the Supabase backend) and `"staticfiles"` (WhiteNoise's `CompressedStaticFilesStorage` — plain compression, deliberately not the `Manifest` variant, see the Commands section above) — Django doesn't merge this setting with any implicit default, so omitting `"staticfiles"` silently reverts static file handling with no error at settings-load time.

## Gotcha: `DISABLE_SERVER_SIDE_CURSORS` lives inside `DATABASES["default"]`

Not a top-level Django setting — it's a key in the database config dict. Required for correctness under Supabase's pooled (pgbouncer transaction-mode) connection, where named/server-side cursors don't work reliably.

## Gotcha: model `post_save` signals must guard `kwargs.get('raw')`

`apps/guestbook/models.py`'s `create_user_profile`/`save_user_profile` and `apps/guestbook/signals.py`'s `send_guestbook_email_notification` all check `if kwargs.get('raw'): return` early. Without this, `manage.py loaddata` (fixture/backup restore) replays every row through normal signal-triggered side effects — auto-creating a `UserProfile` that collides with the fixture's own explicit row, or sending real emails for years-old historical messages. Apply the same guard to any new `post_save` receiver with a side effect (DB write, email, external API call).

## Code style

Ruff is configured for linting (`uv run ruff check`) — line-length (E501) is intentionally excluded since the codebase predates the 88-char convention and isn't reformatted to it yet; don't "fix" long lines just because ruff would otherwise flag them. No formatter (black/ruff format) is set up, so don't assume one exists.

## Git conventions

- Commits: emoji-prefixed conventional commits, `<emoji><type>(<scope>): <Description>` (no space after the emoji), e.g. `✨feat(about): ...`, `🐛fix(blog): ...`, `📝docs(report): ...`. Scope is usually the app/module name. `CONTRIBUTING.md` only documents the plain (non-emoji) form — the emoji prefix is real repo convention, not written down elsewhere.
- Branches: `feature/your-feature-name`.

## Environment

Env vars are loaded via `python-decouple` from a local `.env` (see `.env.example` for keys), plus `.env.local` — a second, gitignored file (Vercel's Supabase integration output via `vercel env pull`) that `FlexForge/config.py`'s `_load_env_local()` merges into `os.environ` at import time (`decouple.config()` doesn't read multiple files natively). SQLite (`db.sqlite3`) is used automatically when `DEBUG=True` or during tests; Supabase Postgres is used otherwise, via `STORAGE_POSTGRES_URL` (pooled/pgbouncer — runtime traffic) or `STORAGE_POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING` (direct — `migrate`/`loaddata`/other DDL, since those are unreliable behind transaction-mode pooling). Set `GUESTBOOK_PAGE=False` to skip Google/GitHub OAuth setup entirely.

`SECRET_KEY`, `ACCESS_TOKEN`, `EMAIL_HOST_USER`, and `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` (`FlexForge/config.py`) have no defaults — the app won't start locally without a `.env` providing all four, even outside the guestbook/Turnstile flows.
