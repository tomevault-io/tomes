# MindRoom Docs

Use this skill when the user asks how MindRoom works, how to configure it, or which commands/workflows to follow.

## Inputs

- If invoked via `!skill mindroom-docs ...`, treat the command arguments as the user question.
- If used implicitly, use the current conversation request.

## Workflow

1. Load `reference-index.md` first to discover the best page files.
2. Load the smallest number of page references needed with `get_skill_reference(...)`.
3. Use `llms.txt` for high-level navigation only.
4. Use `llms-full.txt` only when the answer spans many sections and page-level references are insufficient.
5. Answer with concrete steps and include the exact reference filenames used.

## Rules

- Prefer page-level references (`page__*.md`) over `llms-full.txt`.
- Do not invent behavior not present in the references.
- If information is missing, state that it is not documented in this skill corpus.

## Available references

- `reference-index.md`: mapping of docs pages to reference files.
- `llms.txt`: compact docs index.
- `llms-full.txt`: full combined docs corpus.
- `page__*.md`: per-page rendered markdown references.
