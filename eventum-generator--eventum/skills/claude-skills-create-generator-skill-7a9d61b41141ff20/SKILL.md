description: Create a new Eventum content pack generator end-to-end - research the data source, build, validate, self-review, document, present to the user, publish a hub page to the docs site. Use when this capability is needed.
metadata:
  author: eventum-generator
---

## Input

- Data source name, e.g. `linux-auditd`, `web-nginx`, `network-dns`.
- Optional user constraints (Decide from research if none provided).

## Output

A validated generator at `../content-packs/generators/<name>/` with a README, plus a hub page PR opened in the docs repo (page goes live on PR merge).

## Reference

- Template plugin rules: `.claude/rules/content/templates.md`.
- Generator rules: `.claude/rules/content/generators.md`.
- Hub rules: `.claude/rules/docs/hub.md`.
- Existing generators for layout conventions only, not architecture: `../content-packs/generators/`.

## Process

Nine phases in order. Phases 4 and 5 can send work back when issues surface. Phase 7 is the only user checkpoint.

### 1. Research

Primary sources:
- Elastic integration `sample_event.json` + `fields.yml` per data stream - ground truth for output structure. Save `sample_event.json` for the coverage check in phase 4.
- Vendor documentation: event ID catalogs, log format specs, real-world frequency distributions between event types.
- Protocol or format RFCs where applicable (syslog, CEF, etc.).

Exit criterion: field map (path, source, generation strategy) targeting ≥90% coverage of reference fields, gaps listed with reasons.

### 2. Plan

Architecture options - in `.claude/rules/content/templates.md` and `.claude/rules/content/generators.md`.

- **Picking mode** - which template-plugin mode fits the pipeline shape of the source.
- **Input plugin** - `cron` or `timer` for a steady rate (content-pack convention).
- **State strategy** - where state is needed and at what scope.
- **Source cardinality** - multi-source (many instances, per-instance correlations) vs single-source (one instance, per-flow correlations). Full rule: `generators.md`, section Source cardinality.
- **Sample layout** - which fields come from static samples versus generated live.
- **Template reuse** - whether event types overlap enough to share a template via `vars`.

Do not copy architecture from existing generators - they carry known quality issues. Decisions come from phase 1 facts, not from precedent.

Exit criterion: every architectural choice traceable to a phase 1 fact.

### 3. Build

Generator path: `../content-packs/generators/<name>/`. Conventions: `.claude/rules/content/generators.md` and `.claude/rules/content/templates.md`.

Needed by later phases:
- Reference `sample_event.json` saved under `generators/<name>/reference/` (used in phases 4 and 6).
- Template output structure mirrors the reference (phase 4 needs ≥90% field coverage).

Caveat: `generator.yml` has two distinct fields named `params`. Top-level `params` / `secrets` are `${params.x}` / `${secrets.x}` substitutions for user-facing overrides. `event.template.params` is a Jinja map of template-internal constants. Full rule: generators.md, section Parameterization.

Exit criterion: all files in place, generator runnable.

### 4. Validate

Generate in sample mode from `../content-packs/` and verify the output:

```bash
timeout 15 eventum generate --path generators/<name>/generator.yml --id test --live-mode false || true
```

Ground rules:
- `--live-mode false` required; live mode hangs on cron ticks.
- `timeout 15` terminates the process after 15 seconds - exit code 124 is expected.
- No verbosity flags during validation; high levels stall validation, low levels add noise.
- If the generator errors or produces no output, re-run with `-v` (CRITICAL) up to `-vvvvv` (DEBUG) for diagnostic logs.
- The eventum CLI is already installed - skip package installs.

Five checks, all must pass:
- **JSON parse** - every output line is valid JSON containing ECS fields `@timestamp`, `event`, `ecs` (when applicable).
- **Field coverage** - at least 90% of reference fields present in generated output. List misses with reasons.
- **Branch coverage** - every `{% if %}` / `{% elif %}` / `{% else %}` in templates produces at least one event (grep distinguishing field values to confirm).
- **Sample integrity** - sample files referenced in `generator.yml` exist; every column or key accessed in templates exists in samples; strings containing `"`, `\`, or unicode are escaped via `| tojson`.
- **State safety** - every `shared.set` / `locals.set` / `.append` / `.update` has a cap or cleanup. No unbounded growth.

Any failure returns to phase 3 (Build), or to phase 2 (Plan) if the root cause is architectural.

### 5. Self-review

Check against every rule in `.claude/rules/content/templates.md` and `.claude/rules/content/generators.md`. Skill-specific failure modes:

- Picking mode defaulted to `chance` on a source that is actually stateful, sequenced, or otherwise non-random.
- Top-level `params` / `secrets` declared but missing from the README parameters table.
- Coverage gaps accepted without justification in the phase 1 field map.
- README sample event stale from a pre-rebuild run.

If anything triggers: return to phase 3, or to phase 2 if the issue is architectural. Rerun phase 4, then redo this phase. Proceed only when nothing fires.

### 6. Document

Write the generator's README to the spec in `.claude/rules/content/generators.md`, section README. Match the tone and structure of existing READMEs in `../content-packs/generators/`.

Two additions specific to this skill:
- The Sample output event must be a real event copied from `output/events.json` before the cleanup step below. Not a hand-written sample.
- The Parameters table lists top-level `params` / `secrets` only. `event.template.params` is internal and does not appear there.

After the README is written, delete `output/` and `reference/`. They are test artifacts, not committed.

### 7. Approve

Show the user:

- Location: `../content-packs/generators/<name>/`.
- Event types with distributions and picking mode.
- Coverage: `<covered>/<total>` fields against reference.
- One sample event from generator output.
- All five validation checks with pass/fail status.
- Any notable omissions or trade-offs.

Ask only: proceed to publish to the hub? Architecture was gated in phases 2 and 5 - do not re-open it.

**Explicit ok also authorizes the commit and PR in the docs repo for phase 8** - do not ask for permission again. If changes are requested, return to the relevant phase.

### 8. Publish

Add a hub page in `../docs/` following `.claude/rules/docs/hub.md`. Verify with `pnpm build`.

Workflow:
- In the docs repo, branch off `master` (not `develop`) and target the PR at `master`. Branching from `develop` would sweep unrelated work into the PR. The flow is independent of the eventum release cycle.
- Open the PR after `pnpm build` passes. Do not block phase 9 on merge; record the PR URL and continue.

### 9. Report

Final summary to the user:
- Path to generator: `../content-packs/generators/<name>/`.
- Event types and distributions.
- Coverage percentage.
- Hub page URL (live after the docs PR is merged): `/hub/<name>`.
- Docs-repo PR URL and status.

## Notes

**One generator at a time.** Phase 4 is resource-intensive (real eventum processes plus validation); concurrent load has dropped agents previously. Sequential until parallel load is profiled.
