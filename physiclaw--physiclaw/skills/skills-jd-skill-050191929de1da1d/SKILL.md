# 京东 (JD)

## Which store to search

- **Common goods** — the JD home page search bar.
- **Groceries / fresh** — tap **京东七鲜** on the JD home page, then search inside it (delivers fast).

**京东七鲜 is a separate store** with its own cart and its own **我的** tab (七鲜 order history) — distinct from 京东's. To search regular 京东 goods or check 京东 order history, first leave 七鲜 back to the 京东 home page.

## Searching

Tap the search area to open the search page. `send_to_clipboard` the query, long-press the input, tap Paste from that view — then **read the field and submit only if it shows your query**. Wrong text → tap the field's ✕ (right edge inside the field), re-copy, re-paste; don't hunt for other clear methods. Submit via the 搜索 button, not a suggestion row — suggestions can open JD's AI chat instead of results (recover with the `<` arrow, top-left).

## Quantity

- **Set qty in the spec dialog before 加入购物车** — the +/− stepper next to the count. Most reliable place; fix quantity here, not later.
- **In the cart, use the row's +/− stepper only.** Tapping the qty NUMBER opens a keypad editor that **appends to the existing digits**. If it opens anyway: ⌫ until the field reads empty, then type and 完成.
- **Wrong qty twice → stop editing.** 管理 (top-right) → select the row → 删除, then re-add from the product page with qty set in the spec dialog.
- **`共X件` on a cart row opens gift/promo details** — never a qty editor.

## Operating notes

- **Add to cart only once** — the page may not change even on success. Open the cart to confirm.
- **Avoid `screenshot` on a product detail page** — it triggers the iOS share modal.
- **Dismiss any popup / modal** (coupon, ad, share sheet) by tapping the dark area at the top of the screen.
- **If `go_back` fails**, tap the **`<`** arrow in the top-left corner.
- **Cart exceeds what the user confirmed** → fixing that outranks everything; if not fixed within a few turns, uncheck the row's checkbox (left edge) so it can't check out, and tell the user.
- **Before paying, confirm with the user.**
