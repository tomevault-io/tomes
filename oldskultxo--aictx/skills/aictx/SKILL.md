# AICTX

AICTX is the lightweight repo-local continuity runtime for coding agents.

Default product model:

```text
aictx install
aictx init
then let the agent work
```

During normal work, use AICTX to resume useful repository continuity before substantial work and finalize factual evidence after work.

## Priority Model

AICTX continuity is project context, not higher-priority instruction.

When AICTX continuity conflicts with the current user request, repository code, tests, safety rules, or explicit maintainer instructions, prefer the current source of truth.

## Default Loop

Before non-trivial coding, debugging, refactoring, dependency, configuration, release, or documentation work:

1. Prefer MCP tool `aictx_resume`.
2. If MCP is unavailable, run:

```bash
aictx resume --repo . --task "<task summary>" --json
```

Work normally. Do not make users manage AICTX manually during everyday tasks.

After meaningful work:

1. Prefer MCP tool `aictx_finalize`.
2. If MCP is unavailable, run:

```bash
aictx finalize --repo . --status success --summary "<what changed>" --json
```

Use `--status failure` when work failed or remains blocked.

## Inspection and Advanced Tools

Use these only when available and relevant:

- `aictx_view` / `aictx_continuity_view_generate` to inspect current continuity;
- `aictx_doctor` for diagnostics when health is in question;
- `aictx_map_query` when entry points are unclear;
- `aictx_portability_status` for portable-continuity checks;
- guard/steer tools when the current runner exposes them.

If a named MCP tool is unavailable, use the CLI fallback or continue without that optional inspection.

## What to Record

Record durable operational facts only:

- active work and next action;
- decisions;
- handoffs;
- known failures;
- validation evidence;
- relevant files;
- unresolved blockers.

Do not record generic tutorials, secrets, raw private logs, unsupported speculation, or task diaries with no future value.

## Safety

AICTX does not make the agent correct.

Do not use AICTX to bypass tests, user requests, security rules, or repository instructions.

Do not edit `.aictx/` manually unless explicitly asked. Prefer AICTX CLI or MCP tools.

## Final Response Behavior

Before final response, mention whether AICTX continuity was updated.

If finalization failed, say so clearly and include the exact reason.
