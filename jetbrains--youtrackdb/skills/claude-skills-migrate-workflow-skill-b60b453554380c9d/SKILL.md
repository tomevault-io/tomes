## Reading workflow files (TOC protocol)

When you Read any file under `.claude/workflow/` or `.claude/skills/`, follow the protocol in `conventions.md §1.8`:

1. Read the TOC region: from `<!--Document index start-->` to `<!--Document index end-->` (read to the closing delimiter, not a fixed line count). If the file has no TOC region (a file whose only `## ` heading is this bootstrap block carries none, per `§1.8(d)`), read the file in full.
2. Match TOC rows where Roles contains any of your roles (or your role is `any`, or the row's Roles is `any`) AND Phases contains any of your phases (or your phase is `any`, or the row's Phases is `any`).
3. Use `Read(offset, limit)` to read only matched sections; if no row matches your role/phase, the file holds nothing for you — do not read further.

Your role: migrator.
Your phase: any (migration sits outside the phase taxonomy).

Inline refs you find inside workflow files carry the same `name:roles:phases` suffix; apply file-level filtering before opening: a ref matches when any of your roles is in its roles and any of your phases is in its phases, your own `any` on either axis matches every ref on that axis, and a ref whose own roles or phases is `any` matches you. Backtick-wrapped refs carry no suffix; open or skip them at your discretion.

<!--Document index start-->

| Section | Roles | Phases | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| §Inputs | migrator | any | The plan directory and worktree the migration operates on, resolved before any replay step runs. |
| §Step 0 — Create progress tracker | migrator | any | Create the TaskCreate progress tracker so a /clear mid-migration can resume from the last completed commit. |
| §Step 1 — Preflight | migrator | any | Resolve the plan directory and worktree, confirm the branch has migratable artifacts, and abort cleanly when none exist. |
| §Step 2.0 — Bootstrap unstamped artifacts | migrator | any | Stamp any artifact still missing a line-1 workflow-sha before the replay range is computed. |
| §Step 2 — Compute commit range | migrator | any | Derive the replay range from per-artifact stamps and HEAD, bounding retries on an unresolvable stamp. |
| §Step 3 — Load or initialize progress file | migrator | any | Load an existing .migration-progress file to resume, or initialize a fresh one when the migration starts clean. |
| §Step 4 — Per-commit migration loop | migrator | any | Replay each format-relevant commit: context check, read, classify, apply edits, advance stamps, record progress. |
| §4.1 Context check (mandatory before starting the commit) | migrator | any | Check context budget before each commit and checkpoint to a fresh session when it would not fit the whole commit. |
| §4.2 Read the commit | migrator | any | Read the commit's diff and message to determine what workflow-format change it introduced. |
| §4.3 Classify the commit | migrator | any | Classify the commit as format-relevant, no-op, or manual-review-needed to route how its edits are replayed. |
| §4.4 Apply the migration | migrator | any | Apply the commit's format edits to the matching artifacts in place, or route to manual review on a stamp-format halt. |
| §4.5 Advance stamps in lockstep | migrator | any | After the edits land, rewrite every artifact's line-1 stamp to this commit SHA; the order matters for crash resume. |
| §4.6 Update the progress file | migrator | any | Record the replayed commit and its classification in .migration-progress as the crash-resume marker. |
| §4.7 Mark the per-commit task completed | migrator | any | Mark the commit's TaskCreate entry complete so the progress tracker reflects the replayed commit. |
| §4.8 Final stamp-to-HEAD batch | migrator | any | After the loop, batch-rewrite every artifact's line-1 stamp to HEAD; already-at-HEAD artifacts are benign no-ops. |
| §Step 5 — Final summary | migrator | any | Report the replayed and manual-review commits and leave the dirty worktree for the user to review and commit. |
| §Step 6 — Self-improvement reflection | migrator | any | Run the shared reflection pass to capture migration-process friction as YouTrack proposals before ending the session. |
| §Notes | migrator | any | Standing caveats on in-place editing, the dirty-worktree contract, and the no-automatic-commits rule. |

<!--Document index end-->

Auto-detection runs in `/create-plan` Step 1.5 and `/execute-tracks` startup via workflow-drift-check.md:orchestrator,planner:2,3A.

The skill runs inside the branch's own worktree. The branch is a self-contained capsule: workflow-format commits enter its view only when the user explicitly rebases or merges `develop`, so the migration's commit range is derived from per-artifact stamps and HEAD (see `conventions.md` `§1.6`), never from a develop-relative fork point. The skill applies each format-relevant commit's edits to the corresponding artifact files under the active plan's `_workflow/`.

The skill edits files in place and leaves the worktree dirty for the user to review and commit. No automatic commits.

## Inputs
<!-- roles=migrator phases=any summary="The plan directory and worktree the migration operates on, resolved before any replay step runs." -->

`$ARGUMENTS` — optional. When supplied, it must equal the current
branch name (`git branch --show-current`); the migration always runs
in the current worktree on the current branch. Step 1 enforces the
equality and rejects mismatches.

## Step 0 — Create progress tracker
<!-- roles=migrator phases=any summary="Create the TaskCreate progress tracker so a /clear mid-migration can resume from the last completed commit." -->

Before any other tool call, create one task per step below using `TaskCreate`. Mark each `in_progress` when starting, `completed` when done. This list is the checklist; do not skip entries.

1. Preflight: verify clean tree under the active plan's `_workflow/` and resolve the active plan dir
2. Bootstrap unstamped artifacts: prompt for a base SHA covering any unstamped `_workflow/**` artifact
3. Compute commit range + format-relevant commit list
4. Load or initialize progress file
5. Per-commit migration loop (one task per commit will be added at the start of Step 4, after Step 3 trims the resume queue)
6. Final stamp-to-HEAD batch
7. Final summary
8. Self-improvement reflection: invoke `.claude/workflow/self-improvement-reflection.md` with `session-type=migrate-workflow`

## Step 1 — Preflight
<!-- roles=migrator phases=any summary="Resolve the plan directory and worktree, confirm the branch has migratable artifacts, and abort cleanly when none exist." -->

Run these checks in order. Halt on any failure.

**Argument check.** When `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty, it must equal the
current branch name. The single equality covers every legacy reject
case — `refs/heads/...`, `origin/...`, a 7- to 40-character hex SHA,
or a non-existent branch name all fail this check, since none of them
can equal `git branch --show-current`'s plain-branch-name output:

```bash
if [ -n "$ARGUMENTS" ] \
   && [ "$ARGUMENTS" != "$(git branch --show-current)" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: \$ARGUMENTS ($ARGUMENTS) does not match the current branch ($(git branch --show-current))"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Active-plan-dir resolution.** Enumerate `docs/adr/*/_workflow/`
directories in the current worktree:

```bash
ls -d docs/adr/*/_workflow/ 2>/dev/null
```

Apply this ladder and capture the result as `$PLAN_DIR` (the parent
directory, without the trailing `/_workflow/`):

1. **Zero matches** — halt with "no `_workflow/` directory on the
   current branch; nothing to migrate".
2. **Exactly one match** — use it. The parent directory name need
   not match the current branch; branch names and ADR directory
   names are not guaranteed to match.
3. **More than one match** — list them and ask the user which one to
   migrate. One plan at a time.

Subsequent steps reference `$PLAN_DIR` (e.g.,
`$PLAN_DIR/_workflow/implementation-plan.md`) instead of re-running
the ladder.

**Narrow-scope dirty check.** Refuse to start when any tracked file
under the active plan's `§1.6(h)` artifact paths has uncommitted
changes (working tree or index), or when any untracked file lives
there. The scope covers the implementation plan, the design files,
and every track file under `$PLAN_DIR/_workflow/plan/`. The staged
subtree at `$PLAN_DIR/_workflow/staged-workflow/` is deliberately
outside the check: on workflow-modifying branches, in-flight
workflow-document changes accumulate under that subtree during
execution (Phase 4 then promotes them to the live paths in one
commit), and a whole-subtree check would refuse every such session
with staged content present — the dogfood path this skill accepts.

```bash
DIRTY=$(git status --porcelain -- \
  "$PLAN_DIR/_workflow/implementation-plan.md" \
  "$PLAN_DIR/_workflow/design.md" \
  "$PLAN_DIR/_workflow/design-mechanics.md" \
  "$PLAN_DIR/_workflow/plan/" \
  | grep -v '^?? \.migration-progress$')

if [ -n "$DIRTY" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: uncommitted or untracked changes under the active plan's _workflow/ artifacts:"
  printf '%s\n' "$DIRTY"
  echo "Commit, stash, or remove these files before re-running /migrate-workflow."
  exit 1
fi
```

The `.migration-progress` sentinel (Step 3) is the only carve-out;
it is allowed to be untracked or modified mid-session. Any tracked
file under the narrow scope showing a non-`?` status (modified,
added, deleted, renamed, etc.) or any untracked file showing `??`
halts the session with the offending paths printed; the user must
commit, stash, or remove them before re-invoking.

The check is deliberately narrow. The dropped develop-side
whole-tree check incidentally guarded the live skill file
(`.claude/skills/migrate-workflow/SKILL.md`); the staging convention
for workflow-modifying branches (in-flight rewrites land under
`staged-workflow/` rather than the live paths) now keeps the live
skill at develop's state throughout execution, so the migration
always reads the develop-state skill regardless of staged rewrites —
the side-effect protection is no longer needed.

## Step 2.0 — Bootstrap unstamped artifacts
<!-- roles=migrator phases=any summary="Stamp any artifact still missing a line-1 workflow-sha before the replay range is computed." -->

Run the startup script in `migrate-range` mode and read the
`unstamped_files` array it reports. The script owns the
`conventions.md` `§1.6(h)` artifact walk and the stamp classification;
the skill reads the result instead of re-deriving the walk in prose.
The one `migrate-range` invocation here also produces the
`stamped_artifacts` / `base_sha` / `log_range` / `merge_base_failed`
fields Step 2 consumes, so the same JSON file feeds both steps.

```bash
.claude/scripts/workflow-startup-precheck.sh --mode migrate-range \
  > /tmp/claude-migrate-range-$PPID.json
```

If the script exits non-zero (it emits no JSON on a usage or flag
error, exit 2), surface the stderr diagnostic and halt the migration;
do not `Read` the `/tmp` file, which on a failed invocation holds stale
or empty content. The script's stdout is the JSON; redirect it to a
`/tmp` file rather than capturing it into the conversation. The `migrate-range.log_range`
array is intentionally uncapped, because the migration must replay
every workflow-touching commit, unlike the drift gate's `head -10`
display cap. A long branch range could otherwise dump an unbounded
commit list into context on every invocation. Read the file with the `Read`
tool's `offset` / `limit` so the uncapped `log_range` never lands in
context whole; read `unstamped_files` here, and read the range fields
in Step 2 in bounded slices.

The `migrate-range` JSON shape (cite the live shipped
`.claude/scripts/workflow-startup-precheck.sh` `emit_json`
`migrate-range` branch, which is authoritative over any frozen design
text):

```json
{
  "stamped_artifacts": [{"file": "<path>", "sha": "<40-hex>"}, ...],
  "unstamped_files": ["<path>", ...],
  "base_sha": "<40-hex>" | null,
  "log_range": [{"sha": "<40-hex>", "subject": "<commit subject>"}, ...],
  "merge_base_failed": [{"base": "<40-hex>", "sha": "<40-hex>", "files": ["<path>", ...]}, ...]
}
```

`unstamped_files` is the set of `_workflow/**` artifacts the script
found with no parseable line-1 stamp — exactly the classification this
step needs. `$PLAN_DIR` is documentary here (resolved in Step 1); the
script resolves the active plan dir from the branch the same way.

**When `unstamped_files` is empty.** No prompt fires. Continue to
Step 2 (which reads the same JSON file for the range fields).

**When `unstamped_files` is non-empty.** Print the list of unstamped
artifacts and ask the user once for a base SHA covering the set. The
prompt must include the rationale below so the user understands why
the migration cannot guess:

> The artifacts listed above carry no `<!-- workflow-sha: ... -->`
> stamp on line 1, so the migration has no anchor for "what workflow
> version was this artifact last synced to." An auto-computed default
> (the branch's fork-point with `develop`, `git merge-base
> origin/develop HEAD`, HEAD itself, or any other variant) would shift
> forward whenever the branch is rebased onto a newer `develop` and
> silently mark unstamped artifacts as already-current, skipping the
> migration. Provide the SHA of the workflow-format commit these
> artifacts were last synced to; a short prefix or the full 40-char
> form are both accepted.

Validate the response with the two-subcommand check from
`conventions.md` `§1.6(d)`. The `^{commit}` peel rejects tag and ref
names; only commit SHAs pass. The reachability check enforces the
range's upper-bound rule from `§1.6(c)` (HEAD is the comparison anchor,
so the bootstrap SHA must be reachable from HEAD).

The validation block below runs inside a retry loop bounded at three
attempts. On either subcommand failure, print the cause, increment
the attempt counter, and re-prompt the user with the same artifact
list. On the third rejection halt the session with `ERROR: three
rejected attempts; bootstrap aborted` and exit with no edits applied;
do not fall through to Step 2:

```bash
if ! CANON_SHA="$(git rev-parse --verify "$SHA^{commit}" 2>&1)"; then
    echo "ERROR: $SHA is not a valid commit SHA: $CANON_SHA"
    # increment attempt counter, re-enter the prompt; see retry policy below
elif ! git merge-base --is-ancestor "$CANON_SHA" HEAD 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "ERROR: $SHA ($CANON_SHA) is not reachable from HEAD."
    # increment attempt counter, re-enter the prompt; see retry policy below
else
    USER_BOOTSTRAP_SHA="$CANON_SHA"
fi
```

Store the **canonical 40-char `rev-parse` stdout** (`$CANON_SHA`), not
the user's raw input, as `$USER_BOOTSTRAP_SHA`. The canonicalization
happens here, in the agent-side `§1.6(d)` `git rev-parse --verify` /
`git merge-base --is-ancestor` check above; the script does no
validation of its own `--bootstrap-sha` value (the arg parser folds it
into `git merge-base` raw). The canonical form is mandatory on two
counts: Step 4's per-commit lockstep advance writes the value into
artifact stamps, and the stamp regex `[0-9a-f]{40}` in `§1.6(a1)`
rejects shorter values on subsequent parse, so a short-prefix stamp
would fail every drift-check re-read.

**Retry policy (bounded, session-bound counter).** On validation
failure (either subcommand returns non-zero), print the failure cause
and re-prompt the user with the same artifact list. Cap the retry
count at three attempts per `conventions.md` `§1.6(d)`; after the third
rejection print a one-line diagnostic naming the current HEAD SHA
(`echo "Reachability is checked against git rev-parse HEAD =
$(git rev-parse HEAD); if the SHA you supplied is on a different
branch, check out the migration branch first."`), then halt the
session with `ERROR: three rejected attempts; bootstrap aborted` and
exit with no edits applied. The user `/clear`s the session to abandon
the migration.

The counter is **session-bound**: it lives in the conversation, not on
disk. The orchestrator holds the counter across both Step 2.0's
initial prompt and Step 2's recovery re-prompt; the bash blocks above
run once per attempt, and the orchestrator decides whether to
re-invoke them. A `/clear` between attempts resets it. Step 3's
`.migration-progress` file does not exist yet at Step 2.0 time, so no
persistent counter is available; the bound is by design soft against
`/clear`-based abandonment and re-entry. This matches `§1.6(d)`'s
explicit "`/clear`s the session to abandon the migration" exit shape.

The prompt records the user's best guess; the per-commit replay
loop's halt-on-ambiguity in Step 4 is a partial safety net, not a
guarantee. A too-old SHA silently bloats the replay range; a too-new
SHA silently skips needed migrations. Both failure modes are
documented in `conventions.md` `§1.6(d)` so debug sessions have a
starting point.

Step 2 re-invokes the script with `--bootstrap-sha $USER_BOOTSTRAP_SHA`
(when set) so the script folds the bootstrap SHA into the range
alongside the stamped artifacts. When Step 2.0 did not fire (because
`unstamped_files` was empty), `$USER_BOOTSTRAP_SHA` stays unset and
Step 2 reads the range fields straight from the JSON file this step
already produced, with no re-invocation.

## Step 2 — Compute commit range
<!-- roles=migrator phases=any summary="Derive the replay range from per-artifact stamps and HEAD, bounding retries on an unresolvable stamp." -->

The range comes from the script's `migrate-range` output, not from a
re-derived walk in this skill. The script owns both the
`conventions.md` `§1.6(h)` artifact walk and the `git merge-base` fold
that collapses the stamp set to `base_sha` (the oldest stamp reachable
from HEAD per `conventions.md` `§1.6(c)`), then emits the path-scoped
`git log base_sha..HEAD` range as `log_range`. The skill reads those
fields and drives the conversational recovery the script cannot — the
script never prompts.

Step 2.0 already produced the `migrate-range` JSON at
`/tmp/claude-migrate-range-$PPID.json`. Read the range fields from the
**same file** with the `Read` tool's `offset` / `limit` so the
uncapped `log_range` array never lands in context whole (WB1): read
`base_sha` and `merge_base_failed` first (both bounded), and read
`log_range` in bounded slices when building the per-commit queue. The
fields this step consumes:

- `base_sha` — the folded `BASE_SHA` (full `%H` SHA), or JSON `null`
  when the fold produced no clean base (no stamps and no
  `--bootstrap-sha`, or one or more merge-base failures).
- `log_range` — `[{sha, subject}, ...]` for `base_sha..HEAD` over the
  workflow pathspecs, oldest first; the empty array when there is no
  clean base or the range is empty. Uncapped by design.
- `merge_base_failed` — `[{base, sha, files}, ...]`, one entry per
  failing merge-base pair, with `files` already naming the artifact
  paths that emitted the failing SHAs (the script resolves them via
  its `STAMPED_PAIRS` table). The empty array on a clean fold.
- `stamped_artifacts` / `unstamped_files` — the classification Step 2.0
  consumed; available here too if a recovery re-prompt needs the
  current stamped set.

**Halt — no stampable artifacts.** When both `stamped_artifacts` and
`unstamped_files` are empty, the active plan has no stampable artifacts
on disk (a freshly-created `_workflow/` dir holding only a transient
`handoff-*.md`, for example). Per `conventions.md` `§1.6(h)`'s
both-arrays-empty rule, halt the migration with `no artifacts to
migrate` and exit without computing a range.

**Merge-base failure recovery.** When `merge_base_failed` is non-empty,
the script's fold hit a merge-base failure: a stamp pointing at a
git-gc-pruned commit, or two stamps with no reachable common ancestor
in the local repo. The script collects **every** failing pair into
`merge_base_failed` (the `continue` fold mode) rather than stopping at
the first, so one recovery re-prompt covers the full failing set; the
break-shape the drift gate uses would re-prompt once per failing pair
serially. Each entry's `files` array already names the artifact paths
that emitted the failing SHAs, so the skill does not re-resolve SHAs to
paths — it reads them straight from `merge_base_failed[].files`.

Drive the recovery agent-side (the script cannot prompt):

1. **Re-prompt the combined set.** Route the union of the
   originally-unstamped files (`unstamped_files`) and every
   `merge_base_failed[].files` entry back through Step 2.0's bootstrap
   prompt per `conventions.md` `§1.6(c)`. The user supplies one new SHA
   covering the combined set; the validated value **replaces** the
   prior `$USER_BOOTSTRAP_SHA` (the variable stays singular, matching
   `conventions.md` `§1.6(d)`'s one-SHA-per-prompt shape). The
   re-prompt's user-facing text uses the combined file list.
2. **Drop the failed SHAs.** Pass one `--exclude-sha <sha>` per
   `merge_base_failed[].sha` on the re-invoke alongside
   `--bootstrap-sha "$USER_BOOTSTRAP_SHA"`. The repeatable
   `--exclude-sha` flag drops those stamps from the script's fold input,
   so the restarted fold does not re-run `git merge-base` over the same
   failing pair and fail again at the same point; the fresh bootstrap
   SHA anchors the excluded artifacts' range (matching the "treat as
   unstamped" framing in `conventions.md` `§1.6(c)`). Without the
   exclusion the restarted fold would re-walk the same failing stamp and
   exhaust the 3-attempt cap on input the user cannot fix.
3. **Enforce the session-wide 3-attempt cap.** The 3-attempt counter is
   **shared** across Step 2.0's initial prompt and this recovery prompt
   — session-wide, not per-prompt — so a user cannot chain failures
   across both prompts to escape the bound. A user who already burned 2
   attempts in Step 2.0's initial run has 1 attempt left here. On three
   rejections (across any combination of initial + recovery attempts)
   the migration halts with `ERROR: three rejected attempts; bootstrap
   aborted` and exits with no edits applied.
4. **Re-invoke and restart the fold.** On a validated SHA, re-invoke
   the script with the fresh bootstrap SHA and one `--exclude-sha` per
   `merge_base_failed[].sha`, then re-read the JSON file, restarting the
   fold from the top:

   ```bash
   .claude/scripts/workflow-startup-precheck.sh --mode migrate-range \
     --bootstrap-sha "$USER_BOOTSTRAP_SHA" \
     --exclude-sha "$FAILED_SHA_1" --exclude-sha "$FAILED_SHA_2" \
     > /tmp/claude-migrate-range-$PPID.json
   ```

   Supply one `--exclude-sha` flag per `merge_base_failed[].sha`. If the
   script exits non-zero (it emits no JSON on a usage or flag error,
   exit 2), surface the stderr diagnostic and halt the migration; do not
   `Read` the `/tmp` file, which on a failed invocation holds stale or
   empty content. Otherwise re-read `merge_base_failed` from the
   refreshed file. If it is still non-empty (a different pair failed, or
   the bootstrap SHA itself does not reach the stamps), restart the
   recovery loop — still under the shared 3-attempt cap. When it is
   empty, continue to the range computation below.

**Range computation and the empty-log halt.** Once the script reports
a non-null `base_sha` with an empty `merge_base_failed`, the range is
`log_range`. If `log_range` is empty, halt with:
> No workflow-touching commits between stamp base `<short-base_sha>` and HEAD `<short-HEAD>`. Nothing to migrate.

The empty-log halt fires on a fully-stamped branch whose stamps already
point at HEAD (or at every workflow-touching commit between them and
HEAD): the fold collapses to a stamp that is itself the newest
workflow-format commit reachable from HEAD, so the range is empty and
the migration has nothing to replay.

Otherwise, record `base_sha` and the `log_range` commit list (read in
bounded slices via `Read` offset/limit, never inlined whole). Both
values are referenced in the progress file and the final summary. Do
NOT call `TaskCreate` per commit here; per-commit tasks are added at
the start of Step 4, after Step 3 has trimmed the resume queue, so the
task list never drifts from the actual queue.

## Step 3 — Load or initialize progress file
<!-- roles=migrator phases=any summary="Load an existing .migration-progress file to resume, or initialize a fresh one when the migration starts clean." -->

The progress file lives at the worktree root, not inside `_workflow/`:

```
.migration-progress
```

Placing it at the worktree root keeps it outside any tracked subtree, so it does not interfere with the `_workflow/` review diff and `git status` only surfaces it as a single untracked sentinel (the `.migration-progress` carve-out in Step 1's narrow-scope clean check filters it out).

Step 1 has already resolved the active plan directory as `$PLAN_DIR`; Step 4.4 edits files under `$PLAN_DIR/_workflow/`. No second enumeration is needed.

Progress file format:

```
# migrate-workflow progress
# range_start=<BASE_SHA> range_end=<HEAD-sha-at-skill-start>
# renames:
#   <old-path> -> <new-path>
<sha>	<classification>	<subject>
<sha>	<classification>	<subject>
```

- Header lines: `# migrate-workflow progress`, `# range_start=... range_end=...`, and a `# renames:` block. `range_start` is the `BASE_SHA` produced by Step 2's stamp-walking fold (the oldest ancestor reachable from every fold input); `range_end` is `git rev-parse HEAD` captured at skill start — together they pin the commit range Step 4 replays. The renames block starts empty; rename-classified commits (Step 4.6) append one indented `#   <old> -> <new>` line per recorded rename. Step 4.4 consults this block when resolving paths for later commits.
- Body lines: one tab-separated record per migrated commit. Classification is one of `format`, `skill`, `rename`, `noop` (canonical short-names from Step 4.3). Step 5 reads these to produce per-classification counts.

File-existence handling:

- If the file does not exist, create it with the three header lines and an empty body. The file is a sentinel that the user removes after committing the migration. Do not modify `.gitignore`.
- If the file exists, read its header and apply this check:
  - If `range_start=<recorded-sha>` differs from the freshly-computed `BASE_SHA` (Step 2's fold output for this session), halt and ask the user to delete the stale progress file before re-running. The branch's stamp set has shifted since the prior session (new stamps landed, an earlier stamp was rewritten, or the branch was rebased), and the recorded body refers to a range that no longer matches the current artifact state. Warn that the worktree may carry partial edits from the prior run; recommend `git stash` (or commit-then-revert) before deleting the progress file.
  - If `range_start` matches but the recorded `range_end` differs from `git rev-parse HEAD` at this session's start, the branch has advanced since the prior session. Step 2's freshly-computed `git log $BASE_SHA..HEAD` already covers any commits added after the prior run; Step 4's queue is the new log minus the commits already recorded in the body. Update the progress file's `range_end` field to current HEAD before entering Step 4.
- The commits already listed in the body are **done**. Skip them in Step 4.

## Step 4 — Per-commit migration loop
<!-- roles=migrator phases=any summary="Replay each format-relevant commit: context check, read, classify, apply edits, advance stamps, record progress." -->

On first entry to Step 4:

1. Mark Step 0's umbrella task 5 ("Per-commit migration loop") as `in_progress`.
2. For each commit *remaining* in the trimmed queue (i.e., the Step-2 list minus the commits already recorded in `.migration-progress`), call `TaskCreate` with `Migrate commit <short-sha> <subject>`. These are the per-commit tasks consumed by 4.7.

Then iterate. For each commit in the queue, in order:

### 4.1 Context check (mandatory before starting the commit)
<!-- roles=migrator phases=any summary="Check context budget before each commit and checkpoint to a fresh session when it would not fit the whole commit." -->

```bash
cat /tmp/claude-code-context-usage-$PPID.txt 2>/dev/null || echo "ctx: unknown"
```

The `level=` word in that output is authoritative — branch on it directly. The numeric band behind each level lives in `.claude/workflow/workflow.md` § Context Consumption Check; do not restate it here.

If the level is `warning` or `critical`:

1. Do NOT start the next commit.
2. Report progress to the user: which commits are done, which is next, where the progress file lives.
3. Instruct: "Context window is at <level>. Run `/clear` and re-invoke `/migrate-workflow` to resume — already-migrated commits will be skipped via the progress file. If you `/clear` between 4.4 and 4.5, the next session re-replays this commit's edits over already-edited content; run `git diff` before re-invoking."
4. End the session.

Reflection at Step 6 is deliberately skipped on this early-exit path to protect the already-tight context budget; the next session's reflection at Step 6 (once the migration completes successfully) reports this halt as friction.

If `info`: continue, but delegate to sub-agents for any commit whose `git show --stat <sha>` shows either (a) more than 5 files touched under `.claude/workflow/`, `.claude/skills/`, or `.claude/agents/`, or (b) total changed lines greater than 500. The trigger is derivable from `git show --stat` before the full diff is read into orchestrator context, so the delegation decision itself does not burn context.

**Sub-agent contracts.** The orchestrator must interpolate `$ARGUMENTS` and per-commit values into the sub-agent prompt before launch; sub-agents inherit no conversation context and operate against the current worktree.

- **`Explore`** — diff reading.
  - Input: commit SHA and list of files to inspect under the active plan's `_workflow/`.
  - Output: bullet list of `(file, intent-of-change)` pairs. No source quotes longer than 5 lines.
- **`general-purpose`** — batched edits.
  - Input: absolute paths under the active plan's `_workflow/`, plus exact find→replace pairs or a section-insertion template.
  - Output: list of files edited and the line count changed per file.

This is a docs-only migration: sub-agents should use `git show`, `Read`, and `Grep`; mcp-steroid PSI is not required.

If `safe`: continue normally. The `ctx: unknown` fallback (file missing or `$PPID` resolution failed) is treated as `safe` — the file is best-effort, not load-bearing.

### 4.2 Read the commit
<!-- roles=migrator phases=any summary="Read the commit's diff and message to determine what workflow-format change it introduced." -->

```bash
git show --stat <sha>
git show <sha> -- .claude/workflow .claude/skills .claude/agents
git log -1 --format='%B' <sha>
```

The commit message is load-bearing: it states the intent of the format change. Read it first, then the diff.

### 4.3 Classify the commit
<!-- roles=migrator phases=any summary="Classify the commit as format-relevant, no-op, or manual-review-needed to route how its edits are replayed." -->

**First, detect path renames as a side concern** (independent of the classification chosen below):

```bash
git show --diff-filter=R --name-status <sha> -- .claude/workflow .claude/skills .claude/agents
```

For each `R<percentage>\t<old>\t<new>` entry, plan to append one `#   <old> -> <new>` line under the `# renames:` header in Step 4.6. The renames block is populated regardless of which classification wins, so later commits can follow path mappings.

**Then classify the commit into one canonical short-name.** Apply the predicates in order; the first match wins:

1. **`format`** — the commit modifies `.claude/workflow/*.md` (rules, conventions, prompts) or `.claude/agents/*.md` (agent definitions), or makes substantive (non-typo, non-rename-only) edits to `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` bodies. Produces migration edits in Step 4.4.
2. **`skill`** — the commit adds or removes a `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` file with no `.claude/workflow/` or `.claude/agents/` changes. Promote to `format` iff the new or changed SKILL body contains either (a) a reference to `_workflow/`, `docs/adr/*/`, or a per-branch artifact filename (e.g., `implementation-plan.md`, `design-mutations.md`, `tracks/`); or (b) a `MANDATORY` / `required` / `must` statement creating a new mandatory artifact. Otherwise stay `skill`; no edits in Step 4.4.
3. **`rename`** — the commit's diff under `.claude/workflow/`, `.claude/skills/`, and `.claude/agents/` consists exclusively of file renames (no content changes beyond the rename detection threshold). The rename block was populated above; no further edits.
4. **`noop`** — comment-only, whitespace, or single-line typo or wording fixes that do not rename sections, add or remove required fields, or change conventions. Skip 4.4.

Before invoking any edit tool, print one line to the user in the form `commit <short-sha>: <classification> — <reason>` (e.g., `commit 1de3cb0e: format — adds Phase-2 review section to implementation-plan.md`).

**Stamp-format-change halt.** If the commit's diff modifies `conventions.md` `§1.6` stamp-format definition (the `workflow-sha:` regex shape or the line-1 stamp position rule), halt and route the commit to manual review — the in-place migration cannot self-bootstrap a stamp-format change because the writer's `old_string`-match contract assumes the prior format's text shape. Record the commit at 4.6 with classification `manual-review-needed` and skip the per-commit edits in 4.4.

A fifth classification value, `manual-review-needed`, may be set in Step 4.6 only when the user invokes the "skip" escape from a Step 4.4 ambiguity halt, or when 4.3's stamp-format-change halt fires above. It is not selected here in 4.3 as a primary classification.

### 4.4 Apply the migration
<!-- roles=migrator phases=any summary="Apply the commit's format edits to the matching artifacts in place, or route to manual review on a stamp-format halt." -->

For **Format change** commits, identify which files under the active plan's `_workflow/**` (or `.claude/**` if the branch carries local workflow overrides) match the format being changed. Use `Read` and `Bash` (`git ls-files "$PLAN_DIR/_workflow/"`) to find them.

When the diff references a path that may have been renamed earlier in the branch's history, consult the `# renames:` header block in `.migration-progress` and follow any `<old> -> <new>` mappings recorded by prior `rename`-classified commits.

Apply edits with the `Edit` tool against absolute paths under the active plan's `_workflow/`. The migration mutates the current worktree in place; there is no separate source-of-truth worktree.

Common migration patterns to expect (not exhaustive; read the actual diff):

- A required section was added to `implementation-plan.md`: add the section with a `[ ]` placeholder to the branch's plan.
- A section was renamed (e.g., `## Plan Review` → `## Plan Review (Phase 2)`): rename it in every matching file under the branch's `_workflow/`.
- The step-file schema gained a new field (`## Description`, `## Base commit`): add it if missing.
- A glossary term was renamed: global find-replace in the branch's plan and step files, then re-read each touched file to confirm context fits.
- A commit-message convention changed: record the change for the user. Do NOT rewrite past commits.
- A new mandatory artifact appeared (e.g., `design-mutations.md`): create it empty with a header.

Halt the loop and ask the user only if one of these three concrete conditions holds:

- (a) The diff renames a section but the new section name already exists in the branch's artifact (cannot rename onto an existing name without losing content).
- (b) The diff deletes a section that contains user-authored content (non-template wording) in the branch's artifact (the deletion would discard data).
- (c) The diff adds a required field whose value cannot be inferred from existing content in the branch's artifact (no safe default).

If none of these holds, apply the edit mechanically and continue.

**Halt resume contract.** When the halt fires, include this warning in the question: *"If you `/clear` or interrupt before resolving, this commit will be replayed on resume. Run `git diff` first to detect duplicate edits."* (Same crash-window contract as Step 4.6.)

User outcomes:

1. **User supplies a translation** — apply the edit per their guidance. Proceed to 4.6 and record the commit with its original classification (typically `format`).
2. **User says "skip"** — apply no edit. Proceed to 4.6 and record the commit with classification `manual-review-needed`. Step 5 surfaces the count so the user knows which commits to revisit manually.

### 4.5 Advance stamps in lockstep
<!-- roles=migrator phases=any summary="After the edits land, rewrite every artifact's line-1 stamp to this commit SHA; the order matters for crash resume." -->

After sub-step 4.4's edits land and before sub-step 4.6 records the commit in `.migration-progress`, rewrite line 1 of every artifact enumerated by `conventions.md` `§1.6(h)`'s canonical walk under the active plan's `_workflow/` to `<!-- workflow-sha: <current-commit-sha> -->`. The order is load-bearing: edits → advance → progress sentinel, never another order. Reversing edits and advance, or deferring the advance past the progress sentinel, breaks crash resume — see `design.md` §"Per-commit replay and lockstep advance" for the case analysis. The `design.md` sequence diagram in §"Migration replay loop" is the authoritative ordering; §"Per-commit replay and lockstep advance" carries the crash-window analysis.

For each stamped artifact, use the `Edit` tool against line 1 with the **prior stamp** as `old_string` and the new `<!-- workflow-sha: <current-commit-sha> -->` as `new_string`. For the K-th commit in the queue (K ≥ 2), the **prior stamp** is the SHA 4.5 wrote on its previous iteration. Re-read `head -1 "$f"` at the start of each 4.5 fire to capture the current `PREV_SHA`; do not reuse the session-start stamp value. For K=1, `PREV_SHA` is the artifact's line-1 stamp at session start (Step 2's stamped set), or the bootstrap SHA after 4.5's unstamped-artifact branch ran for the artifact. The exact-string match makes the writer idempotent on equal SHAs (re-running on an artifact already at this commit's SHA: the prior stamp text is no longer present, so `Edit` raises an `old_string` mismatch — treat this as a benign no-op, do not retry and do not halt, because the post-condition `<!-- workflow-sha: <current-commit-sha> -->` on line 1 already holds) and portable across platforms (no `sed -i` BSD/GNU dialect difference).

Artifacts that were not stamped at session start gain their first stamp here as a side effect. At 4.5 invocation time, an artifact takes this bootstrap branch iff `head -1 "$f"` does not start with `<!-- workflow-sha:`; the `$UNSTAMPED_FILES` set Step 2.0 computed is informational (it drives Step 5's count summary), so do not rely on its membership at 4.5 — re-check per artifact. For files on the bootstrap branch, the `Edit` writer has no prior stamp to match. Use `Read` to capture the **full file content**, prepend a new line `<!-- workflow-sha: <current-commit-sha> -->\n` above the existing line 1, then `Write` the entire concatenated content back to the same path. After the first successful per-commit replay these artifacts join the stamped set and the standard `Edit` path applies on subsequent commits. A crash between `Read` and `Write` on this path leaves the artifact unstamped (the on-disk content is identical to its pre-4.5 state). The next session re-enters Step 2.0 with the same `$UNSTAMPED_FILES` set, re-prompts for the bootstrap SHA, and 4.5's bootstrap branch fires again on this artifact for the same commit — idempotent under the user supplying the same SHA.

This sub-step is the crash-resume marker: the next session reads any stamp, finds the last successfully-replayed SHA, and resumes at the next commit. See `design.md` §"Migration replay loop" for the sequence diagram and §"Per-commit replay and lockstep advance" for the crash-window analysis.

### 4.6 Update the progress file
<!-- roles=migrator phases=any summary="Record the replayed commit and its classification in .migration-progress as the crash-resume marker." -->

Append one tab-separated line to the body of `.migration-progress` at the worktree root:

```
<sha>	<classification>	<subject>
```

`<classification>` is the canonical short-name from Step 4.3 (`format`, `skill`, `rename`, or `noop`), or the special value `manual-review-needed` when the user invoked "skip" from a Step 4.4 ambiguity halt.

For `rename`-classified commits, **also** insert one indented `#   <old-path> -> <new-path>` line under the `# renames:` header (one line per rename recorded by the commit) so later commits can follow the mapping. For `manual-review-needed`, skip the renames update and apply no edits; the body line alone is enough to keep the commit out of the replay queue on the next run.

Mechanism: read the file with `Read`, mutate the contents in memory (append the body line and, for renames, insert the header line(s) under `# renames:`), then write the full file back with `Write`. Do not use `Edit` here; the initial file may have no trailing newline, so the `old_string`-based path is unreliable. Do not stage or commit the file; it lives outside git history.

If the process is killed between applying edits in 4.4 and updating `.migration-progress` here, the next run will replay the same commit. After a crash, run `git diff` before resuming to detect duplicate edits.

### 4.7 Mark the per-commit task completed
<!-- roles=migrator phases=any summary="Mark the commit's TaskCreate entry complete so the progress tracker reflects the replayed commit." -->

`TaskUpdate` the matching task to `completed`. Move to the next commit. When the queue is exhausted, mark Step 0's umbrella task 5 ("Per-commit migration loop") as `completed` before falling through to sub-step 4.8.

### 4.8 Final stamp-to-HEAD batch
<!-- roles=migrator phases=any summary="After the loop, batch-rewrite every artifact's line-1 stamp to HEAD; already-at-HEAD artifacts are benign no-ops." -->

Mark Step 0's umbrella task 6 ("Final stamp-to-HEAD batch") as `in_progress`. After the per-commit loop exits (the queue is exhausted) and before Step 5's final summary runs, re-stamp every artifact present on disk to `git rev-parse HEAD`. This sub-step lands invariant I2: at session end, every stamped artifact's line-1 SHA equals HEAD's SHA.

Capture HEAD once via `git rev-parse HEAD` into `$HEAD_SHA`. Then walk every artifact under `$PLAN_DIR/_workflow/**` per `conventions.md` `§1.6(h)`'s enumeration; for each artifact, read the current line-1 stamp (`head -1 "$f"`) and call `Edit` with that value as `old_string` and `<!-- workflow-sha: $HEAD_SHA -->` as `new_string`. Artifacts already at HEAD (their prior 4.5 fire already wrote this SHA) fail the `old_string` precondition — treat the mismatch as a benign no-op (the post-condition already holds), do not retry, do not halt. Optional artifacts absent from disk (`design-mechanics.md` on branches that never crossed the length trigger) are silently skipped by `§1.6(h)`'s `ls 2>/dev/null` shape.

Re-stamp every artifact in the walk, including artifacts whose stamp the per-commit advance in sub-step 4.5 already updated to a SHA inside the range. A re-stamp that does change content covers two cases — an artifact whose last per-commit advance landed at a non-HEAD SHA inside the range (because no later replayed commit touched its file shape), and an artifact whose first stamp arrived through 4.5's unstamped-artifact bootstrap branch at a pre-HEAD SHA.

The final batch and the per-commit advance use the same `Edit`-against-line-1 writer, so the recovery story is uniform: a killed-mid-4.8 session leaves some artifacts at `HEAD_SHA` and the rest at the prior per-commit advance SHA, which the next `/migrate-workflow` session reads as non-uniform stamps. Step 2.0's fold collapses to the lowest, range derivation re-queues the not-yet-stamped commits (an empty range when every commit has already been replayed), and 4.8 fires again to land I2.

After the walk exits, mark Step 0's umbrella task 6 as `completed`.

## Step 5 — Final summary
<!-- roles=migrator phases=any summary="Report the replayed and manual-review commits and leave the dirty worktree for the user to review and commit." -->

Mark Step 0's umbrella task 7 ("Final summary") as `in_progress`. `$HEAD_SHA` is the value sub-step 4.8 captured via `git rev-parse HEAD`; re-derive it here by running `git rev-parse HEAD` again — the value is unchanged since 4.8. `$USER_BOOTSTRAP_SHA` was captured at Step 2.0; if it is no longer in conversation state, recover it by reading line 1 of any artifact in `$UNSTAMPED_FILES` (the bootstrap branch stamped them at this value during the first commit's 4.5 fire). If Step 2.0 did not run this session (no unstamped artifacts), omit the bootstrap-count summary line entirely.

Output:

- Workflow stamps now at `$HEAD_SHA` (the value sub-step 4.8 captured from `git rev-parse HEAD`). This is the post-condition I2 lands; surfacing it in the summary gives the user a one-glance confirmation that every artifact in the active plan reached the same SHA.
- When `$USER_BOOTSTRAP_SHA` is set (Step 2.0 fired because the session started with at least one unstamped artifact), emit: "Bootstrapped N previously unstamped artifacts using SHA `$USER_BOOTSTRAP_SHA`", where N is the size of the `$UNSTAMPED_FILES` set Step 2.0 collected. Skip this line entirely when `$USER_BOOTSTRAP_SHA` is unset (fully-stamped session) so the summary stays terse on the common path.
- Count of commits migrated, of each classification (`format`, `skill`, `rename`, `noop`, `manual-review-needed`). Compute by reading the body of `.migration-progress` and counting each value of column 2.
- If any commits were recorded as `manual-review-needed`, list their short-SHA and subject so the user knows which to revisit manually.
- Total files edited in the branch's worktree, excluding the progress-file sentinel: `git status --porcelain | grep -v '^?? \.migration-progress$' | wc -l`.
- One-line next-step prompt: "Review the diff in this worktree, then commit + push when satisfied. Delete `.migration-progress` after the commit."

After printing the summary lines above, mark Step 0's umbrella task 7 as `completed`. Then proceed to Step 6.

## Step 6 — Self-improvement reflection
<!-- roles=migrator phases=any summary="Run the shared reflection pass to capture migration-process friction as YouTrack proposals before ending the session." -->

Mark Step 0's umbrella task 8 (`Self-improvement reflection`) as `in_progress`, then mark umbrella task 8 as `completed` **before** invoking the reflection protocol. The flip is intentional: `self-improvement-reflection.md` ends the session at its final "End the session" step and never returns control here, so any post-invoke completion line is unreachable. Treating the umbrella task as "I am about to invoke reflection" (not "reflection completed") keeps the user's task list consistent even though the reflection itself runs after the flip. Then invoke `.claude/workflow/self-improvement-reflection.md` with `session-type=migrate-workflow` (see `self-improvement-reflection.md` §"What counts as a worth-recording issue" for the migration-shaped friction examples). The protocol owns its own YouTrack MCP-reachability check and end-of-session contract; nothing else fires after it returns.

## Notes
<!-- roles=migrator phases=any summary="Standing caveats on in-place editing, the dirty-worktree contract, and the no-automatic-commits rule." -->

- The skill edits artifacts in the branch's own worktree and never commits on the user's behalf; the user reviews the diff and commits + pushes after the session ends.
- For large diffs, delegate to `Explore` to summarize commit diffs and `general-purpose` to apply repetitive edits across many files; pass absolute paths inside the branch's worktree.
- This is a docs-only migration; mcp-steroid IDE control adds no value here.
- Re-invoking the skill on the same branch is safe: commits already recorded in `.migration-progress` are skipped. To force a full re-run, delete the progress file.
