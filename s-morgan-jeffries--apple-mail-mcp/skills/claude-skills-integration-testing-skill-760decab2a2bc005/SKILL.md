# Apple Mail Integration Testing

## Why Integration Tests Matter

Unit tests mock `_run_applescript()` and test Python logic only. They CANNOT catch:
- AppleScript syntax errors
- Variable naming conflicts in AppleScript
- Mail.app API behavior differences between versions
- Silently-dropped record keys from NSJSONSerialization (e.g., `name`, `id`, `size` selector collisions)
- Gmail-specific behavior differences
- Timeout issues with real mailbox sizes

**The OmniFocus project's story:** A variable naming typo went undetected by 400+ unit tests because they all mocked the AppleScript boundary. Only integration tests against the real app caught it. This lesson applies equally to Apple Mail.

## Three-Tier Testing Strategy

| Tier | Speed | What it catches | When to run |
|------|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| Unit (mocked) | ~1s, 99 tests | Python logic, parsing, validation | Every change |
| Integration (real) | ~30s | AppleScript bugs, Mail.app quirks | New AppleScript code |
| E2E (full MCP) | ~30s | Tool registration, parameter passing | New/modified tools |

## Setting Up Integration Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Apple Mail configured with at least one account
2. macOS Automation permission granted to Terminal/IDE

### Test Account Setup
```bash
# Set test account (default: "Gmail")
export MAIL_TEST_ACCOUNT="Gmail"

# Run integration tests
make test-integration
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Integration tests are opt-in
pytest tests/integration/ --run-integration -v

# Or via Makefile
make test-integration
```

## Writing Integration Tests

```python
import pytest
from apple_mail_fast_mcp.mail_connector import AppleMailConnector

# Skip unless explicitly enabled
pytestmark = pytest.mark.skipif(
    "not config.getoption('--run-integration')",
    reason="Integration tests disabled by default."
)

class TestMailIntegration:
    @pytest.fixture
    def connector(self) -> AppleMailConnector:
        return AppleMailConnector()

    @pytest.fixture
    def test_account(self) -> str:
        import os
        return os.getenv("MAIL_TEST_ACCOUNT", "Gmail")

    def test_list_mailboxes(self, connector, test_account):
        """Verify we can list mailboxes from a real account."""
        result = connector.list_mailboxes(test_account)
        assert isinstance(result, list)
        assert len(result) > 0
        # INBOX should always exist
        assert any("INBOX" in mb for mb in result)

    @pytest.mark.skip(reason="Sends real email - enable manually")
    def test_draft_send_now(self, connector):
        """Test sending a draft - enable manually only."""
        ...
```

## Key Patterns

### Never Auto-Run Destructive Tests
```python
# Destructive operations (send, delete, move) should be:
# 1. Skipped by default
# 2. Require explicit --run-integration flag
# 3. Require MAIL_TEST_ACCOUNT environment variable
# 4. Target a specific test account, never "all accounts"
```

### Test Account Configuration
```python
@pytest.fixture
def test_account(self) -> str:
    """Configurable test account - never hardcode."""
    import os
    return os.getenv("MAIL_TEST_ACCOUNT", "Gmail")
```

### Cleanup After Tests
```python
# If test creates data (mailbox, flag), clean up in fixture teardown
@pytest.fixture
def test_mailbox(self, connector, test_account):
    name = f"MCP-Test-{uuid.uuid4()}"
    connector.create_mailbox(test_account, name)
    yield name
    try:
        # Cleanup - don't fail if already deleted
        connector.delete_mailbox(test_account, name)
    except Exception:
        pass
```

## Hard Rule

**If you wrote or modified AppleScript in `mail_connector.py`, integration tests must cover that operation before merge.**

This is not optional. This is not "nice to have." Unit tests with mocked `_run_applescript()` give false confidence about AppleScript correctness.

## Common Integration Test Failures

1. **"Not authorized to send Apple events"** — Grant Automation permission in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Automation
2. **Account not found** — Verify `MAIL_TEST_ACCOUNT` matches an actual configured account name in Mail.app
3. **Timeout** — Large mailboxes may exceed 60s default. Use `AppleMailConnector(timeout=120)`
4. **Gmail behavior** — Gmail move/delete may behave differently than IMAP accounts. Test both if possible.
