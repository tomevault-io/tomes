# Apple Mail MCP Performance Patterns

## The Core Insight

**The bottleneck is per-subprocess overhead.** Each `osascript` call costs 100-300ms regardless of what it does. All performance work reduces the number of subprocess calls.

## Known Operation Timings

| Operation | Time | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Single `osascript` call overhead | 100-300ms | Minimum cost per subprocess |
| `search_messages` (typical INBOX) | ~1-5s | Depends on mailbox size and filter count |
| `get_message` (single) | <1s | Direct ID lookup |
| `create_draft` (with `send_now=True`) | ~1-2s | Includes Mail.app compose + send |
| `update_message` (bulk read/flag) | ~1-2s | Single script for N messages via `_bulk_repeat_block` |
| `update_message` (move) | ~1-3s | Varies by account type (Gmail slower) |
| `save_attachments` | ~2-5s | Depends on attachment count/size |

## Pattern 1: Use `whose` Clauses for Server-Side Filtering

```applescript
-- GOOD: Server-side filter (fast, Mail.app evaluates internally)
set msgs to (messages of mbox whose sender contains "user@example.com")

-- BAD: Fetch all then filter in Python (slow, transfers all data)
set msgs to every message of mbox
-- then filter in Python loop
```

`whose` clauses let Mail.app filter internally without transferring unmatched messages over IPC. This is 10-50x faster for large mailboxes.

## Pattern 2: Single Script Per Batch Operation

```python
# GOOD: One osascript call for N messages (near-constant time)
script = """
tell application "Mail"
    repeat with msgId in {id1, id2, id3}
        set read status of (first message whose id is msgId) to true
    end repeat
end tell
"""
self._run_applescript(script)

# BAD: N osascript calls for N messages (linear time)
for msg_id in message_ids:
    self._run_applescript(f'tell application "Mail" ...')
```

Batch operations should always build a single AppleScript that handles all items.

## Pattern 3: Use `limit` for Pagination

The `search_messages` tool accepts a `limit` parameter (default: 50). AppleScript uses `items 1 thru N of` for server-side limiting. Always pass a reasonable limit — fetching 10,000 messages when the user wants the latest 10 wastes time.

## Pattern 4: Accept Optional Account/Mailbox Parameters

Message ID lookup is O(accounts x mailboxes) when searching globally. Always accept optional `account` and `mailbox` parameters to narrow the search scope. If the caller knows which account, the search is dramatically faster.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Repeated subprocess calls in loops** — Build one script, execute once
- **Fetching all properties when only some are needed** — Scripts currently fetch a fixed set of fields; when adding a new field, consider whether every caller needs it
- **Not using `whose` clauses** — Manual filtering in Python transfers all data first
- **Default timeout too low for large operations** — Increase from 60s for bulk operations on large mailboxes

## Gmail Performance Notes

Gmail operations are inherently slower than IMAP because:
- Move requires copy + delete (two operations instead of one)
- Label operations don't map cleanly to folder operations
- Search across Gmail labels may scan differently than IMAP folders

## Profiling

No formal benchmarking infrastructure yet (see issue #31). When added:
- Use 5 iterations per operation
- Calculate mean, stdev, CV%
- Set thresholds at 5x documented baseline
- Detect cold starts (first run > 2x median of remaining)
