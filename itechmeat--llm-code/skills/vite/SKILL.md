## Core rules

- Prefer minimal configuration; extend only as needed.
- Keep `index.html` as a first-class entry point when using Vite defaults.
- Treat dev server settings and build settings separately.
- Document mode-dependent behavior for env variables and `define`.
- Use `future` config to opt-in to deprecation warnings before migration.

## Recipes

- Scaffold a project with `npm create vite@latest`.
- Configure aliases, server options, and build outputs in `vite.config.*`.
- Load `.env` values into config with `loadEnv` when config needs them.
- Add plugins with `plugins: []` and define `apply` or `enforce` when needed.
- Use HMR APIs for fine-grained updates when plugin or framework needs it.
- Use `optimizeDeps.include/exclude` when deps aren't discovered on startup.
- Use `build.rollupOptions.input` for multi-page apps.
- Enable deprecation warnings: `future: { removeSsrLoadModule: 'warn' }`.
- Use `hotUpdate` hook instead of `handleHotUpdate` for environment-aware HMR.
- Use `this.environment` instead of `options.ssr` in plugin hooks.

## Release Highlights (8.0.0)

- Default browser target is raised again under `baseline-widely-available`.
- CommonJS default-import interop becomes more consistent and may expose packages that relied on older ambiguous behavior.
- Vite stops resolving `browser` vs `module` via format sniffing and follows configured `resolve.mainFields` more strictly.
- JS API `build()` now throws `BundleError` with nested `.errors` when multiple Rolldown-level errors are present.
- Rolldown transition becomes more explicit: `build.rollupOptions` / `worker.rollupOptions` are deprecated in favor of `*.rolldownOptions`.

## Prohibitions

- Do not copy large verbatim chunks from vendor docs.
- Do not assume framework-specific behavior without verifying.
