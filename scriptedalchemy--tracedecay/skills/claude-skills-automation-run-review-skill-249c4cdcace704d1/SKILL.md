# Automation run review

Review automation without mutating it:

1. Use `tracedecay_automation_run_list` to find the exact run id.
2. Use `tracedecay_automation_run_view` to inspect terminal status, counts,
   validation report, effects, and advertised artifact kinds.
3. Use `tracedecay_automation_run_artifact_view` only for an artifact kind
   advertised by that run; verify the returned hash-backed payload against the
   terminal record.
4. For skill-writer runs, verify automatic validation, activation, and
   materialization against `tracedecay_skill_list` and
   `tracedecay_skill_view`. For memory-curator runs, verify committed effects
   with read-only fact queries.
5. Report failures after committed effects as reconciliation work. Never rerun
   blindly or manufacture a manual settlement step.
