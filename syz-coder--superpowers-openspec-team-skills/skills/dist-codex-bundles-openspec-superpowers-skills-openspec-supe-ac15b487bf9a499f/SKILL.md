# OpenSpec + Superpowers Workflow

Use this standalone skill when a feature should start with OpenSpec proposal, design, specs, and tasks before handing off to Superpowers implementation planning, TDD, and verification.

This is an explicit opt-in workflow. Do not use it by default. Only use it when the user explicitly asks for it, names `$openspec-superpowers-workflow`, or a repository policy explicitly requires it.

If this workflow already produced `tasks.md` for the current request and the next user turn confirms, revises, or continues those tasks, keep this workflow active even if the skill name is not repeated.

If `.superpowers-memory/` exists in the repository, read it before planning and update it before closing the workflow.

## Workflow

1. Explore the repository context enough to understand the requested behavior change.
2. Clarify requirements one question at a time only as needed to write accurate OpenSpec artifacts.
3. Derive or confirm a kebab-case OpenSpec change name.
4. Run `openspec status --change "<change-name>" --json` to inspect required artifact order.
5. Before writing each artifact, run `openspec instructions <artifact> --change "<change-name>" --json`.
6. Complete the change artifacts in dependency order:
   - `proposal.md`
   - `design.md`
   - `specs/.../spec.md`
   - `tasks.md`
7. Re-check `openspec status --change "<change-name>" --json` until all required artifacts are ready.
8. Stop OpenSpec apply-style execution.
9. Summarize the generated OpenSpec tasks.
10. By default, ask the user to confirm the OpenSpec task checklist before implementation planning starts.
11. After the user confirms `tasks.md`, pause again and ask whether to continue execution development.
12. Do not route the confirmed handoff through OpenSpec apply.
13. If the user chooses execution development, write the implementation plan to `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`.
14. Prefer a repo-local worktree when the task is non-trivial or risky.
15. Implement with TDD:
   - write the failing test first
   - run it to confirm failure
   - write the minimal implementation
   - run tests again to confirm success
16. Run fresh verification commands before any completion claim.
17. If the project uses OpenSpec archive flow, archive the change after code, specs, and tests are aligned.

## Guardrails

- Do not skip required OpenSpec artifacts for behavior changes.
- Do not use OpenSpec apply as the implementation stage for this combined workflow.
- After OpenSpec `tasks.md` is complete, stop OpenSpec apply-style execution, summarize the generated tasks, and by default ask the user to confirm the OpenSpec task checklist before handing off to Superpowers execution.
- Do not stop after OpenSpec artifacts with a readiness message such as "run apply", "/opsx:apply", or "let me start implementation".
- Do not resume through OpenSpec apply after `tasks.md` is confirmed; the only allowed next-step prompt is whether to continue execution development.
- After the user confirms or revises the generated tasks on a follow-up turn, treat that turn as the continuation of this workflow, keep the workflow active, and ask whether to continue execution development.
- Do not continue directly into Superpowers execution after OpenSpec artifacts until the user has explicitly confirmed the generated `tasks.md` and chosen execution development as the next step.
- After Superpowers execution and verification complete, ask whether to continue code review.
- Treat OpenSpec tasks as constraints and checklist input for the Superpowers implementation plan.
- Do not report success without fresh verification evidence.
- Keep paths repo-local and avoid machine-specific assumptions.

## Deliverables

- OpenSpec change under `openspec/changes/<change-name>/`
- Implementation plan under `docs/superpowers/plans/`
- Code, tests, and verification output
