# Pull Request Review Workflow

Comprehensive workflow for reviewing pull requests with architecture compliance and quality gates.

## IMPORTANT: Read Architecture First

**Before reviewing any code, you MUST read the appropriate architecture reference:**

### Global Architecture Files
```
~/.claude/architecture/
├── clean-architecture.md    # Core principles for all projects
├── flutter-mobile.md        # Flutter + Riverpod
├── react-frontend.md        # React + Vite + TypeScript
├── go-backend.md            # Go + Gin
├── laravel-backend.md       # Laravel + PHP
├── remix-fullstack.md       # Remix fullstack
└── monorepo.md              # Monorepo structure
```

### Project-specific (if exists)
```
.claude/architecture/        # Project overrides
```

**Review must verify compliance with architecture patterns defined in these files.**

## Recommended Agents

| Phase | Agent | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| ANALYZE | `@clean-architect` | Architecture compliance check |
| REVIEW | `@code-reviewer` | Code quality and best practices |
| REVIEW | `@security-audit` | Security vulnerabilities scan |
| REVIEW | `@perf-optimizer` | Performance analysis |
| REVIEW | `@test-writer` | Test coverage and quality |

## Phase 1: FETCH

**Goal**: Gather all PR information and context

### Actions
1. Fetch PR details:
   ```bash
   gh pr view [PR_NUMBER] --json number,title,body,author,state,commits,reviews,files
   ```

2. Get the diff:
   ```bash
   gh pr diff [PR_NUMBER]
   ```

3. List all commits:
   ```bash
   gh pr view [PR_NUMBER] --json commits --jq '.commits[] | "\(.oid[:7]) \(.messageHeadline)"'
   ```

4. Check CI/CD status:
   ```bash
   gh pr checks [PR_NUMBER]
   ```

5. **Identify project stack** from PR files and read architecture doc

### Output
```markdown
## PR #[NUMBER]: [TITLE]

### Metadata
- **Author**: [author]
- **State**: [open/merged/closed]
- **Stack**: [Flutter/React/Go/Laravel/Remix]
- **Architecture Doc**: [path to doc]
- **Files Changed**: [count]
- **Additions**: +[count] / **Deletions**: -[count]

### Commits
1. [commit 1]
2. [commit 2]

### Description
[PR body]

### CI/CD Status
[pass/fail status]
```

### Gate
- [ ] PR details fetched
- [ ] Diff obtained
- [ ] Commits listed
- [ ] Stack identified
- [ ] Architecture doc identified

---

## Phase 2: ANALYZE

**Goal**: Understand the changes and identify affected areas

### Actions
1. **Read the architecture doc** for this stack
2. Analyze what changed:
   - Which layers are affected? (per architecture doc)
   - What's the scope? (feature/fix/refactor/docs)
   - Are there breaking changes?

3. Identify impact areas based on architecture:
   - Frontend/Backend/Database?
   - Which modules/packages?
   - Dependencies changed?

4. Check for red flags:
   - [ ] Large PR (>500 lines)?
   - [ ] Multiple unrelated changes?
   - [ ] Conflicts with architecture patterns?
   - [ ] Missing tests?
   - [ ] No description?

### Analysis Output
```markdown
## Change Analysis

### Architecture Reference
- Doc: [path to architecture doc]
- Pattern: [pattern from doc]

### Scope
- Type: [Feature/Fix/Refactor/Docs/Chore]
- Breaking Changes: [Yes/No]

### Recommendation
**COMMENT** - Let's discuss before proceeding
```

### Actions

1. Post review on GitHub:
   ```bash
   # Approve
   gh pr review [PR_NUMBER] --approve --body "[feedback]"

   # Request changes
   gh pr review [PR_NUMBER] --request-changes --body "[feedback]"

   # Comment
   gh pr review [PR_NUMBER] --comment --body "[feedback]"
   ```

2. Add inline comments for specific issues:
   ```bash
   gh pr comment [PR_NUMBER] --body "[comment]"
   ```

3. Update PR status if needed:
   ```bash
   # Add labels
   gh pr edit [PR_NUMBER] --add-label "needs-changes"
   gh pr edit [PR_NUMBER] --add-label "security-review"
   gh pr edit [PR_NUMBER] --add-label "architecture-review"
   ```

### Feedback Principles

1. **Be Specific**: Point to exact file and line
2. **Be Constructive**: Suggest solutions, not just problems
3. **Be Kind**: Assume good intent
4. **Reference Docs**: Link to architecture docs when relevant
5. **Prioritize**: Separate critical from optional
6. **Explain Why**: Help author learn

### Example Inline Comment
```markdown
**[file.ts:123]** - Architecture Violation

Issue: Business logic in presentation layer
Reference: `react-frontend.md` - Section 3.2

This violates the architecture pattern. Business logic should be in:
- `src/domain/usecases/`

Suggested fix:
1. Create `src/domain/usecases/calculateTotal.ts`
2. Move logic there
3. Call from component

Example:
\`\`\`typescript
// Component
const total = await calculateTotalUseCase.execute(items);

// Usecase
export class CalculateTotalUseCase {
  execute(items: Item[]): number {
    // logic here
  }
}
\`\`\`
```

- [ ] Decision made (approve/request/comment)
- [ ] Review posted to GitHub
