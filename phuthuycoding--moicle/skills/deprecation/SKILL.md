# Deprecation Workflow

Systematic workflow for safely deprecating and removing features or code without breaking user workflows.

## IMPORTANT: Read Architecture First

**Before deprecating anything, you MUST read the appropriate architecture reference:**

### Global Architecture Files
```
~/.claude/architecture/
├── clean-architecture.md    # Core principles for all projects
├── flutter-mobile.md        # Flutter + Riverpod
├── react-frontend.md        # React + Vite + TypeScript
├── go-backend.md            # Go + Gin
├── laravel-backend.md       # Laravel + PHP
├── remix-fullstack.md       # Remix fullstack
└── monorepo.md              # Monorepo structure
```

### Project-specific (if exists)
```
.claude/architecture/        # Project overrides
```

**Understand dependencies and impact before deprecating.**

## Recommended Agents

## Phase 1: IDENTIFY

**Goal**: Identify what to deprecate and its full impact

### Actions

1. **Identify project stack and read architecture doc**

2. Define what to deprecate:
   - [ ] Feature/module/API/class/method
   - [ ] Reason for deprecation
   - [ ] Alternative solution (if any)

3. Analyze dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Find all usages (adjust per stack)

   # TypeScript/JavaScript
   grep -r "deprecatedFunction" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js"

   # Go
   grep -r "DeprecatedFunc" --include="*.go"

   # PHP
   grep -r "deprecatedMethod" --include="*.php"

   # Dart
   grep -r "deprecatedWidget" --include="*.dart"
   ```

4. Identify stakeholders:
   - [ ] Internal teams using this
   - [ ] External users/customers
   - [ ] Third-party integrations
   - [ ] Documentation references

5. Assess impact based on architecture:
   - [ ] Which layers affected (from architecture doc)
   - [ ] Dependencies between layers
   - [ ] Breaking change severity
   - [ ] Migration complexity

6. Check version control history:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --all -- [deprecated-file]
   git blame [deprecated-file]
   ```

### Output
```markdown
## Deprecation Analysis

### Stack & Architecture
- Stack: [Flutter/React/Go/Laravel/Remix]
- Architecture Doc: [path to doc]

### What to Deprecate
- Type: [Feature/API/Class/Method/Module]
- Name: [full name/path]
- Reason: [why deprecating]

```

### Gate
- [ ] Architecture doc read
- [ ] Deprecation target identified
- [ ] All usages found
- [ ] Impact assessed
- [ ] Stakeholders identified
- [ ] Alternative exists (or valid reason for removal)

---

## Phase 2: PLAN

**Goal**: Create migration plan and timeline

### Actions

1. **Re-read architecture doc** for migration patterns

2. Choose deprecation strategy:

   **Soft Deprecation** (Gradual):
   - Mark as deprecated with warnings
   - Provide alternative
   - Keep functional during grace period
   - Remove later

   **Hard Deprecation** (Immediate):
   - Breaking change in next major version
   - Force migration
   - Use for security/critical issues

3. Define timeline:
   ```
   Recommended timelines:

   Internal APIs:
   - Announce: Now
   - Warning: +2 weeks
   - Removal: +4-6 weeks

   Public APIs:
   - Announce: Now
   - Warning: +1 version (minor)
   - Removal: +1 version (major)
   - Total: 3-6 months minimum

   Critical security issues:
   - Announce: Now
   - Removal: Next patch/ASAP
   ```

4. Create migration guide:
   - [ ] What's being deprecated
   - [ ] Why it's being deprecated
   - [ ] What to use instead
   - [ ] How to migrate (step-by-step)
   - [ ] Code examples (before/after)
   - [ ] Automated migration tools (if possible)

5. Plan communication:
   - [ ] Changelog entry
   - [ ] Release notes
   - [ ] Email notifications (if external)
   - [ ] Documentation updates
   - [ ] In-code warnings

6. Identify risks and mitigation:
   - [ ] Users won't migrate → Extend timeline
   - [ ] No alternative exists → Build it first
   - [ ] Complex migration → Provide tooling
   - [ ] External dependencies → Coordinate

### Planning Template
```markdown
## Deprecation Plan

### Architecture Reference
- Doc: [path to architecture doc]
- Affected patterns: [patterns from doc]

### Strategy

| [Risk 1] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Plan] |
| [Risk 2] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Plan] |

### Rollback Plan
If deprecation causes issues:
- [ ] How to revert
- [ ] Fallback option
- [ ] Communication plan
```

### Gate
- [ ] Plan follows architecture doc
- [ ] Timeline defined
- [ ] Migration path clear
- [ ] Communication planned
- [ ] Risks identified
- [ ] Rollback plan exists

---

## Phase 3: MIGRATE

**Goal**: Help users migrate to the alternative

### Actions

1. **Announce deprecation** (T-90):

   Add to CHANGELOG.md:
   ```markdown
   ## [Version] - YYYY-MM-DD

   ### Deprecated
   - `[deprecated item]` is now deprecated and will be removed in [version/date]
     - Reason: [why]
     - Alternative: Use `[new item]` instead
     - Migration guide: [link to guide]
   ```

2. **Add deprecation markers in code** (T-60):

   TypeScript/JavaScript:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * @deprecated Use newFunction() instead. Will be removed in v2.0.0
    * @see newFunction
    */
   function oldFunction() {
     console.warn('oldFunction is deprecated. Use newFunction instead.');
     // existing implementation
   }
   ```

   Go:
   ```go
   // Deprecated: OldFunc is deprecated, use NewFunc instead.
   // It will be removed in v2.0.0.
   func OldFunc() {
       log.Println("WARNING: OldFunc is deprecated, use NewFunc")
       // existing implementation
   }
   ```

   PHP (Laravel):
   ```php
   /**
    * @deprecated 2.0.0 Use newMethod() instead
    */
   public function oldMethod() {
       trigger_error(
           'oldMethod is deprecated, use newMethod instead',
           E_USER_DEPRECATED
       );
       // existing implementation
   }
   ```

   Dart (Flutter):
   ```dart
   @Deprecated('Use newWidget instead. Will be removed in v2.0.0')
   class OldWidget extends StatelessWidget {
     // existing implementation
   }
   ```

3. **Update documentation** (T-60):
   - [ ] Mark deprecated in API docs
   - [ ] Add migration guide
   - [ ] Update examples to use new approach
   - [ ] Add deprecation notice banner
   - [ ] Update README/guides

4. **Create migration tools** (if needed):
   ```bash
   # Example: Automated migration script
   # TypeScript/JavaScript
   npx jscodeshift -t migrate-deprecated-api.js src/

   # Go
   go fix

   # Create custom migration scripts
   ```

5. **Proactive migration** (T-30):

   For internal code:
   ```bash
   # Find all usages
   grep -r "deprecated" --include="*.ts"

   # Migrate one by one
   # Test after each migration
   # Commit frequently
   ```

   For external users:
   - [ ] Email notifications with migration guide
   - [ ] Office hours / support sessions
   - [ ] Example migration PRs
   - [ ] FAQ document

6. **Monitor adoption**:
   ```bash
   # Track usage of deprecated code
   # Add metrics/logging if possible
   # Follow up with slow adopters
   ```

### Migration Checklist

---

## Phase 4: REMOVE

**Goal**: Safely delete the deprecated code

### Actions

1. **Pre-removal verification** (T-0):

   Check adoption:
   ```bash
   # Verify deprecation warnings are logged
   # Check metrics for usage
   # Confirm migration targets met
   ```

   Criteria for removal:
   - [ ] Timeline completed
   - [ ] Migration adoption > 80% (internal)
   - [ ] No critical blockers
   - [ ] Stakeholders notified
   - [ ] Alternative is stable

2. **Create removal branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b remove/deprecated-[feature-name]
   ```

3. **Read architecture doc** for affected layers

4. **Remove deprecated code**:

   Remove in order (following architecture):
   ```
   1. Tests for deprecated code
   2. Deprecated implementation
   3. Deprecated interfaces/types
   4. Documentation references
   5. Migration scripts (if no longer needed)
   ```

   For each file:
   ```bash
   # Remove the deprecated code
   # Remove deprecation warnings
   # Remove related tests
   # Update imports/dependencies

   # Run tests after each removal
   [test command from architecture doc]

   # Commit if successful
   git add .
   git commit -m "remove: [what was removed]"
   ```

5. **Update version**:

   Breaking change requires major version bump:
   ```
   Semantic Versioning:
   - Major version: Breaking changes (X.0.0)
   - Minor version: New features backward compatible (0.X.0)
   - Patch version: Bug fixes (0.0.X)
   ```

6. **Update documentation**:
   - [ ] Remove from API docs
   - [ ] Archive migration guide (keep for reference)
   - [ ] Update CHANGELOG
   - [ ] Update version compatibility matrix
   - [ ] Update examples

### Removal Checklist
```markdown

---

## Phase 5: VERIFY

**Goal**: Ensure nothing is broken post-removal

### Actions

1. **Full test suite** (command from architecture doc):
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   flutter test              # Flutter
   flutter test --coverage

   go test ./...             # Go
   go test -cover ./...

   bun test                  # React/Remix
   bun test --coverage

   php artisan test          # Laravel
   php artisan test --coverage
   ```

2. **Integration testing**:
   - [ ] Critical user flows work
   - [ ] No regressions
   - [ ] Performance unchanged
   - [ ] Error handling works

3. **Build verification**:
   ```bash
   # Clean build test
   rm -rf node_modules && npm install && npm run build  # Node
   go clean && go build ./...                            # Go
   flutter clean && flutter build                        # Flutter
   composer install && php artisan optimize             # Laravel
   ```

4. **Dependency check**:
   ```bash
   # Check for broken imports
   # Verify all dependencies resolve
   # No circular dependencies introduced
   ```

5. **Monitor after release** (T+30):
   - [ ] Error rates normal
   - [ ] Performance metrics stable
   - [ ] No spike in support requests
   - [ ] User feedback positive/neutral

6. **Handle issues**:

   If problems arise:
   ```markdown
   Severity assessment:
   🔴 Critical - Rollback immediately
   🟠 High - Hotfix within 24h
   🟡 Medium - Fix in next patch
   🟢 Low - Document workaround
   ```

  - Reason: Inconsistent API design
  - Migration guide: https://docs.example.com/migrate-to-v2
```

#### Release Notes
```markdown
## Deprecations

### `oldFeature` is now deprecated

**What**: The `oldFeature` API is deprecated.

**Why**: It doesn't align with our architecture patterns and causes confusion.

**When**: Will be removed in v2.0.0 (estimated: YYYY-MM-DD)

**Migration**: Use `newFeature` instead:

```javascript
// Before
import { oldFeature } from 'package';
oldFeature.doSomething();

// After
import { newFeature } from 'package';
newFeature.doSomething();
```

**Need help?** See the [migration guide](link) or contact support.

| VERIFY | 7-30 days | Test, monitor, support |

### Deprecation Strategies

#### Soft Deprecation
**Use when:**
- Non-critical feature
- Time for gradual migration
- Backward compatibility important
- External users affected

**Approach:**
- Add warnings but keep functional
- Provide migration period
- Remove in future major version

#### Hard Deprecation
**Use when:**
- Security vulnerability
- Critical bug
- Technical debt removal
- Internal-only code

**Approach:**
- Breaking change in next major version
- Shorter timeline
- Force migration

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Silent Deprecation
```
DON'T: Remove without announcement
DON'T: No warnings or migration guide
DO: Clear communication at every step
```

### Rushed Timeline
```
DON'T: Remove before users can migrate
DON'T: Skip migration period
DO: Give adequate time based on impact
```

### No Alternative
```
DON'T: Deprecate without replacement
DON'T: Force users into worse solution
DO: Provide better alternative first
```

### Poor Communication
```
DON'T: Assume users read release notes
DON'T: One-time announcement only
DO: Multi-channel, repeated communication
```

### Breaking Without Warning
```
DON'T: Remove in minor/patch version
DON'T: Surprise breaking changes
DO: Follow semantic versioning
DO: Breaking changes only in major versions
```

### Ignoring Feedback
```
DON'T: Ignore migration blockers
DON'T: Proceed despite user concerns
DO: Listen and adjust timeline if needed
```
