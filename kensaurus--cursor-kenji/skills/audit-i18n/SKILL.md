# audit-i18n — Natural, Human-Sounding Translations

**Translations that read like machine output erode user trust** — especially in
the user's own language. A Japanese user reading stiff, over-literal English
translated to Japanese can feel it immediately. This skill finds every unnatural,
jargon-heavy, or technically-worded string and rewrites it to sound like a real
person in that locale.

> **The goal**: every string should sound like it was written by a native speaker
> who understands the user, not translated from English by a developer.

## Core principles for good copy

These apply to every string in every locale:

| Bad | Better | Why |
|-----|--------|-----|
| "Invalid email format" | "That email doesn't look right — check for typos" | Guides, doesn't blame |
| "An error occurred" | "Something went wrong. Try again, or contact us if it keeps happening" | Actionable |
| "Please enter a valid value" | "This field is required" or "Enter a number between 1 and 100" | Specific |
| "Authentication failed" | "Wrong email or password" | Plain language |
| "Submit" | "Save", "Send message", "Create account" | Says what actually happens |
| "OK" | "Got it", "Done", or the specific action | Less dismissive |
| "User" | "you", "your account" | Conversational |
| "The operation was successful" | "Done!" or "Saved" | Natural |
| "Do you want to proceed?" | "Are you sure? This can't be undone." | Honest and specific |

## Phase 0: Detect the i18n setup

```
package.json   → i18next, react-i18next, next-intl, vue-i18n, @angular/localize,
                 i18n-js, rosetta, lingui, typesafe-i18n
src/i18n/      → translation files
locales/       → JSON/YAML translation files
messages/      → next-intl message files
public/locales → common path for react-i18next
```

Identify:
- **Library**: react-i18next / next-intl / vue-i18n / lingui / custom
- **Active locales**: list of language codes (`en`, `ja`, `fr`, `de`, `zh`, etc.)
- **Translation file format**: JSON / YAML / TypeScript / PO files
- **Completeness**: are all locales present? Do non-English files have all keys?

Fetch library docs:
```json
context7:resolve-library-id
{
  "libraryName": "react-i18next"
}
```

## Phase 1: Find hardcoded strings in source code

Look for user-facing text that bypasses the i18n system entirely.

Scan for:
- String literals in JSX/TSX: `<p>Welcome back</p>`, `<button>Save</button>`
- Template literals with user-visible content: `` `Hello ${name}` ``
- Alert/toast calls with hardcoded strings: `toast.error("Something failed")`
- Error message strings in API handlers returned to the client
- Placeholder text: `placeholder="Enter your email"`
- Aria labels: `aria-label="Close dialog"`
- `alt` text on meaningful images

Use shell to scan (the codebase search tools may be slow on large repos):
```bash
grep -rn 'placeholder="' src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.jsx" | head -30
grep -rn '"en":' src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | head -20
```

Build a list: file path, line number, string content, whether it has an i18n key already.

---

## Phase 2: Audit translation file completeness

For each locale, check that all keys from the base locale (usually `en`) exist:

```bash
# Example: compare en.json vs ja.json key counts
node -e "
const en = require('./public/locales/en/common.json');
const ja = require('./public/locales/ja/common.json');
const missing = Object.keys(en).filter(k => !ja[k]);
console.log('Missing in ja:', missing);
"
```

Or for next-intl format:
```bash
node -e "
const en = require('./messages/en.json');
const ja = require('./messages/ja.json');
function findMissing(base, target, path='') {
  for (const k of Object.keys(base)) {
    const kp = path ? path+'.'+k : k;
    if (!(k in target)) console.log('MISSING:', kp);
    else if (typeof base[k] === 'object') findMissing(base[k], target[k], kp);
  }
}
findMissing(en, ja);
"
```

## Phase 3: Review translation quality

This is the most important phase. For each locale, review every string
against the natural-language principles at the top of this skill.

### What to look for in each category

**Error messages** — must guide, not blame, and tell the user what to do:
```json
// Before
"errors.email_invalid": "Invalid email address"

// After
"errors.email_invalid": "That doesn't look like a valid email — check for typos and try again"
```

**Action buttons** — must describe the outcome, not just label the input:
```json
// Before
"buttons.submit": "Submit"
"buttons.confirm": "OK"

// After
"buttons.submit": "Save changes"  // or whatever the action actually does
"buttons.confirm": "Got it"       // or the specific action: "Delete account", "Send message"
```

**Empty states** — should explain and invite, not just state the absence:
```json
// Before
"empty.projects": "No projects"

// After
"empty.projects": "You haven't created any projects yet. Start one to get going."
```

**Success messages** — should feel warm and confirm the action clearly:
```json
// Before
"success.saved": "Data saved successfully"

// After
"success.saved": "Saved!"  // or "Your changes are saved"
```

**Loading states** — should be human:
```json
// Before
"loading.data": "Loading data..."

// After
"loading.data": "Getting things ready…"  // or just omit "Loading" entirely
```

### Locale-specific tone guidelines

| Locale | Tone notes |
|--------|-----------|
| `en` | Friendly, direct, conversational. Use contractions ("you've", "can't"). No formal passive voice. |
| `ja` | Use polite but natural keigo (〜ます/〜です form). Avoid literal translations of English idioms. Use short, clear sentences. Don't overuse katakana loanwords when Japanese alternatives exist. |
| `ko` | Polite 합쇼체 or 해요체 depending on the app's audience. Avoid Konglish where natural Korean exists. |
| `zh-TW` / `zh-CN` | Traditional vs simplified — do not mix. Natural, not literal. Check that date/number formats are locale-correct. |
| `fr` | Formal `vous` for most apps; `tu` only for clearly youth/casual products. Gender agreement must be correct — check nouns. |
| `de` | German compounds can get long — check for truncation. Formal `Sie` for business apps. |
| `es` | Check for `tú`/`usted`/`vosotros` consistency. Latin American vs Spain variants differ. |
| RTL (`ar`, `he`) | Mirror layout. Check that numbers are LTR within RTL text. Verify UI wraps correctly. |

## Phase 4: Walk the live app in each locale (Playwright)

For each active locale:

1. Navigate to the locale-specific URL or trigger the locale switcher
2. Walk the key flows: onboarding, core feature, error states, empty states, settings
3. Screenshot each screen for visual review

```javascript
// Set locale via URL or cookie depending on the app
await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/ja'); // or set cookie
await browser_snapshot(); // capture the state
```

Look for:
- Strings that are still in English (untranslated keys showing as key names like `common.save`)
- Text that overflows its container in longer languages (German, Finnish, Russian)
- Date/time formatting that doesn't match the locale (30/01/2026 vs Jan 30, 2026 vs 2026年1月30日)
- Currency symbols in the wrong position (`$10.00` vs `10,00 €` vs `¥1,000`)
- Numbers using the wrong decimal/thousands separator (1,234.56 vs 1.234,56)
- Plural forms: English has singular/plural; many languages have more forms

---

## Phase 5: Fix — priority order

### Fix 1: Extract all hardcoded strings

For every hardcoded string found in Phase 1, create an i18n key and replace it:

```typescript
// Before (react-i18next)
<p>Welcome back, {name}!</p>

// After
const { t } = useTranslation('common');
<p>{t('welcome_back', { name })}</p>
```

```json
// en/common.json
"welcome_back": "Welcome back, {{name}}!"

// ja/common.json
"welcome_back": "おかえりなさい、{{name}}さん！"
```

### Fix 2: Rewrite poor translations

Edit the translation files directly. Prioritise:
1. Error messages that blame or confuse users
2. Empty states that dead-end users
3. Action buttons that say "Submit" or "OK"
4. Any string a native speaker would read and say "that's not how we talk"

### Fix 3: Add missing locale keys

For any key missing in a non-English locale, add a natural translation.
If you don't have a native speaker for a locale, use a clearly-marked placeholder:
```json
"some_key": "[TODO: needs native Japanese review] {{count}} items selected"
```

### Fix 4: Fix number/date/currency formatting

Use the i18n library's format functions rather than manual formatting:

```typescript
// react-i18next with i18next-icu or i18next-intervalPlural
t('items_count', { count: 5 }) // handles plural forms automatically

// Intl API for dates and numbers (framework-agnostic)
new Intl.DateTimeFormat(locale, { dateStyle: 'long' }).format(date);
new Intl.NumberFormat(locale, { style: 'currency', currency: 'JPY' }).format(1234);
```

## Phase 6: i18n audit report

```markdown
## i18n Audit Report — [App] — [Date]

### Active locales
[list with coverage % — keys present / total keys]

### Hardcoded strings found
| File | Line | String | Action |
|------|------|--------|--------|
| src/components/Foo.tsx | 42 | "Save" | Extracted to key `buttons.save` |

### Translation quality issues fixed
| Locale | Key | Before | After | Issue type |
|--------|-----|--------|-------|-----------|
| ja | errors.email_invalid | "無効なメールアドレス" | "メールアドレスが正しくないようです。入力内容をご確認ください。" | Too literal, not helpful |

### Missing keys added
[count per locale]

### Formatting fixes
[date/number/currency issues found and fixed]

### Still needs native review
[keys marked [TODO] that need a human native speaker]
```
