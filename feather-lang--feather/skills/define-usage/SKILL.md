# Define Usage Skill

Step-by-step process for adding or updating usage help documentation for built-in commands in feather.

## When to Use This Skill

- Adding usage help to a command that doesn't have it
- Fixing inaccurate or outdated help text
- Ensuring help text matches Feather's actual capabilities (not TCL's)

## Working Process

### 1. Check Current Help Status

Test if the command already has usage help:

```bash
echo "usage help <command>" | ./bin/feather-tester
```

If no help exists, you'll see:
```
no usage defined for "<command>"
```

### 2. Review the Command Implementation

Read the command's implementation to understand what it actually does:

```bash
# Read the builtin implementation
cat src/builtin_<command>.c
```

Key things to identify:
- What arguments does it accept?
- What does it return?
- What are the error cases?
- Are there any Feather-specific limitations vs TCL?

### 3. Check TCL Documentation (If Applicable)

If implementing a TCL command, use the **view-manual** skill to check the reference manual:

```bash
man -P cat n <command>
```

The TCL manpage provides the authoritative format for help output. Key elements to adapt:
- **Subcommand signatures**: Show the full signature like `namespace children ?namespace? ?pattern?`
- **Detailed descriptions**: Each subcommand should have 1-2 paragraphs explaining its behavior
- **Paragraph breaks**: Use `\n\n` to separate distinct concepts within descriptions

**IMPORTANT**: Do not copy TCL documentation verbatim. Feather has important differences:
- **No array support** - Array syntax like `myArray(key)` is not supported
- Limited standard library - Many TCL commands may not exist
- Cross-references must point to commands that exist in Feather

### 4. Identify Feather-Specific Constraints

Key differences from TCL to document:

**Arrays**: Feather does not support TCL-style arrays per CLAUDE.md. If TCL docs mention array functionality, explicitly state arrays are not supported.

**Cross-references**: Only reference commands that have (or will have) usage help in Feather:
- Keep references if the command will be documented later
- Remove references to standard TCL commands not in Feather
- Use judgment: namespace, global, variable, upvar are core and will be added

### 5. Write the Usage Registration Function

The usage registration function follows this pattern:

```c
void feather_register_<command>_usage(const FeatherHostOps *ops, FeatherInterp interp) {
  FeatherObj spec = feather_usage_spec(ops, interp);

  // Command description (for NAME and DESCRIPTION sections)
  FeatherObj e = feather_usage_about(ops, interp,
    "Brief one-line description",
    "Detailed description paragraph 1.\n\n"
    "Detailed description paragraph 2.\n\n"
    "Note about Feather-specific behavior if needed.");
  spec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, spec, e);

  // Required arguments
  e = feather_usage_arg(ops, interp, "<argName>");
  e = feather_usage_help(ops, interp, e, "Description of argument");
  spec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, spec, e);

  // Optional arguments
  e = feather_usage_arg(ops, interp, "?optionalArg?");
  e = feather_usage_help(ops, interp, e, "Description of optional argument");
  spec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, spec, e);

  // Examples
  e = feather_usage_example(ops, interp,
    "command arg1 arg2",
    "Description of what this example does",
    NULL);
  spec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, spec, e);

  feather_usage_register(ops, interp, "<command>", spec);
}
```

### 6. Add Declaration and Registration

**Add to src/internal.h:**

```c
void feather_register_<command>_usage(const FeatherHostOps *ops, FeatherInterp interp);
```

**Add call in src/interp.c** in the `feather_register_usage()` function:

```c
feather_register_<command>_usage(ops, interp);
```

### 7. Build and Test

```bash
# Build the project
mise build

# View the generated help
echo "usage help <command>" | ./bin/feather-tester
```

Review the output carefully:
- Is the SYNOPSIS correct?
- Does the DESCRIPTION match Feather's behavior?
- Are Feather-specific notes clear?
- Are examples helpful and accurate?
- Do cross-references point to real/future commands?

### 8. Verify Formatting

The help output should follow Unix manpage format:

```
command(1)                General Commands Manual               command(1)

NAME
       command - Brief description

SYNOPSIS
       command <required> ?optional?

DESCRIPTION
       Detailed description with proper paragraph breaks.

       Second paragraph if needed.

ARGUMENTS
       <required>
              Description of required arg
       ?optional?
              Description of optional arg

EXAMPLES
       Description of example:

           command example code
```

### 9. Commit Changes

Use the commit skill or create a descriptive commit:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Add usage help for <command> command

Implemented comprehensive usage documentation including:
- NAME and SYNOPSIS sections
- Detailed DESCRIPTION of behavior
- ARGUMENTS documentation
- EXAMPLES section

[Note any Feather-specific deviations from TCL]"
```

## Usage API Reference

### Core Functions

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `feather_usage_spec()` | Create new spec |
| `feather_usage_about()` | Set command name and description |
| `feather_usage_arg()` | Add argument (use `<name>` for required, `?name?` for optional) |
| `feather_usage_flag()` | Add flag (use `-short` for TCL-style single-dash flags) |
| `feather_usage_cmd()` | Add subcommand with its own nested spec |
| `feather_usage_clause()` | Mark subcommand as a clause (appears after args, not first) |
| `feather_usage_section()` | Add custom section (e.g., "String Indices") |
| `feather_usage_help()` | Add short help text to previous element |
| `feather_usage_long_help()` | Add detailed description (1-2 paragraphs) to previous element |
| `feather_usage_example()` | Add code example with description |
| `feather_usage_add()` | Add element to spec |
| `feather_usage_register()` | Register complete spec for command |

### Argument Syntax

| Syntax | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `<name>` | Required positional argument |
| `?name?` | Optional positional argument |
| `<name>...` | Variadic required (1 or more) |
| `?name?...` | Variadic optional (0 or more) |

**Note**: Use `?arg?` not `[arg]` because `[]` triggers command substitution in TCL.

### Subcommands

**IMPORTANT**: If a command has subcommands, each subcommand MUST be structurally defined using `feather_usage_cmd()`. Do NOT just list subcommands in help text - they must be registered as structured data to appear in the COMMANDS section of help output.

Use `feather_usage_long_help()` to provide detailed descriptions (1-2 paragraphs) for each subcommand, following the TCL manpage format. See `src/builtin_namespace.c` for an example of comprehensive subcommand documentation.

```c
// Create a subspec for the subcommand's arguments
FeatherObj subspec = feather_usage_spec(ops, interp);
e = feather_usage_arg(ops, interp, "?namespace?");
subspec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, subspec, e);
e = feather_usage_arg(ops, interp, "?pattern?");
subspec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, subspec, e);

// Register the subcommand with detailed description
e = feather_usage_cmd(ops, interp, "children", subspec);
e = feather_usage_long_help(ops, interp, e,
    "Returns a list of all child namespaces that belong to the namespace. "
    "If namespace is not specified, then the children are returned for the "
    "current namespace.\n\n"
    "If the optional pattern is given, then this command returns only the "
    "names that match the glob-style pattern.");
spec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, spec, e);
```

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `feather_usage_cmd()` | Define a subcommand with its own nested spec |
| `feather_usage_long_help()` | Add detailed description (1-2 paragraphs) |

When subcommands are properly registered, the help output includes a COMMANDS section matching TCL manpage format:

```
COMMANDS
       command children ?namespace? ?pattern?
              Returns a list of all child namespaces that belong to the
              namespace. If namespace is not specified, then the
              children are returned for the current namespace.

              If the optional pattern is given, then this command
              returns only the names that match the glob-style pattern.
```

#### Subcommand Help Behavior

When users request help for a specific subcommand (e.g., `usage help string match`), the system automatically:

1. **Extracts the description** from the subcommand's `long_help` and displays it in the DESCRIPTION section
2. **Includes any flags** defined in the subcommand's spec with their help text
3. **Adds a SEE ALSO section** referencing the parent command

This means you don't need to duplicate descriptions - the `long_help` you provide with `feather_usage_cmd()` serves double duty for both the parent's COMMANDS section and the subcommand's own help page.

#### Clause Subcommands

Some commands have syntax elements that look like subcommands but appear after other arguments rather than as the first argument. For example, the `try` command has handler clauses (`on`, `trap`, `finally`) that appear after the body script:

```tcl
try body ?handler...? ?finally script?
```

For these cases, use `feather_usage_clause()` to mark the subcommand as a "clause". Clause subcommands:
- **Appear in the COMMANDS section** for documentation purposes
- **Do NOT add `<COMMAND>` to the SYNOPSIS** (since they're not first-argument subcommands)
- **Support subcommand help** (e.g., `usage help try on` works)

```c
// Define the clause subcommand
e = feather_usage_cmd(ops, interp, "on", subspec);
e = feather_usage_clause(ops, interp, e);  // Mark as clause
e = feather_usage_long_help(ops, interp, e,
    "This clause matches if the evaluation of body completed with the exception "
    "code code. The code may be expressed as an integer or one of the following "
    "literal words: ok, error, return, break, or continue.");
spec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, spec, e);
```

See `src/builtin_try.c` for a complete example of clause subcommand usage.

### Flags

Use `feather_usage_flag()` to add command-line style flags. The function requires 5 arguments:

```c
FeatherObj feather_usage_flag(ops, interp, short_flag, long_flag, value);
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `short_flag` | Single-dash flag like `"-nocase"` (required) |
| `long_flag` | Double-dash alternative (use `NULL` if none) |
| `value` | Value placeholder like `"<len>"` (use `NULL` for boolean flags) |

**IMPORTANT**: Always add help text to flags with `feather_usage_help()`.

```c
// Boolean flag (no value)
e = feather_usage_flag(ops, interp, "-nocase", NULL, NULL);
e = feather_usage_help(ops, interp, e, "Causes the comparison to be done in a case-insensitive manner");
spec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, spec, e);

// Flag with value
e = feather_usage_flag(ops, interp, "-length", NULL, "<len>");
e = feather_usage_help(ops, interp, e, "Only compare the first <len> characters");
spec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, spec, e);
```

### Custom Sections

Use `feather_usage_section()` to add custom sections like "String Indices" that appear after DESCRIPTION:

```c
e = feather_usage_section(ops, interp, "String Indices",
    "When referring to indices into a string, the following forms are recognized:\n\n"
    "integer    The character at the specified integral index\n\n"
    "end        The last character of the string\n\n"
    "end-N      The character N characters before the last character");
spec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, spec, e);
```

**Special behavior**: Sections named "See Also" (case-insensitive) are automatically rendered last, after EXAMPLES.

### Multi-paragraph Descriptions and Lists

Use `\n\n` (double newline) to separate paragraphs and list items. This ensures proper formatting in the rendered output:

```c
// Paragraphs
"First paragraph about basic functionality.\n\n"
"Second paragraph about special cases.\n\n"
"Third paragraph about edge cases."

// Formatted lists (each item gets its own paragraph)
"The following special sequences may appear in pattern:\n\n"
"*          Matches any sequence of characters, including empty\n\n"
"?          Matches any single character\n\n"
"[chars]    Matches any character in the given set"
```

**WARNING**: Using single `\n` between list items causes them to render as a single wrapped paragraph. Always use `\n\n` for visual separation.

## Common Patterns

### Simple Command with One Required Argument

```c
void feather_register_return_usage(const FeatherHostOps *ops, FeatherInterp interp) {
  FeatherObj spec = feather_usage_spec(ops, interp);

  FeatherObj e = feather_usage_about(ops, interp,
    "Return from a procedure",
    "Causes current procedure to return immediately with specified value.");
  spec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, spec, e);

  e = feather_usage_arg(ops, interp, "?value?");
  e = feather_usage_help(ops, interp, e, "The value to return (default: empty string)");
  spec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, spec, e);

  e = feather_usage_example(ops, interp,
    "return 42",
    "Return value 42 from procedure",
    NULL);
  spec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, spec, e);

  feather_usage_register(ops, interp, "return", spec);
}
```

### Command with Feather-Specific Note

```c
void feather_register_set_usage(const FeatherHostOps *ops, FeatherInterp interp) {
  FeatherObj spec = feather_usage_spec(ops, interp);

  FeatherObj e = feather_usage_about(ops, interp,
    "Read and write variables",
    "Returns the value of variable varName. If value is specified, then set "
    "the value of varName to value.\n\n"
    "Note: Feather does not support TCL-style arrays. The varName must refer "
    "to a scalar variable. Array syntax like \"myArray(key)\" is not supported.");
  spec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, spec, e);

  // ... rest of implementation
}
```

### Command with Multiple Arguments

```c
// For a command like: lrange list first last
e = feather_usage_arg(ops, interp, "<list>");
e = feather_usage_help(ops, interp, e, "The list to extract elements from");
spec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, spec, e);

e = feather_usage_arg(ops, interp, "<first>");
e = feather_usage_help(ops, interp, e, "Index of first element");
spec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, spec, e);

e = feather_usage_arg(ops, interp, "<last>");
e = feather_usage_help(ops, interp, e, "Index of last element");
spec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, spec, e);
```

### Subcommand with Flags

```c
// Define subcommand spec with flags and arguments
FeatherObj matchSpec = feather_usage_spec(ops, interp);

// Add flags first (they appear in OPTIONS section)
e = feather_usage_flag(ops, interp, "-nocase", NULL, NULL);
e = feather_usage_help(ops, interp, e, "Case-insensitive matching");
matchSpec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, matchSpec, e);

// Add arguments
e = feather_usage_arg(ops, interp, "<pattern>");
matchSpec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, matchSpec, e);
e = feather_usage_arg(ops, interp, "<string>");
matchSpec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, matchSpec, e);

// Register subcommand with detailed description
e = feather_usage_cmd(ops, interp, "match", matchSpec);
e = feather_usage_long_help(ops, interp, e,
    "See if pattern matches string; returns 1 if it does, 0 if it "
    "does not.\n\n"
    "The following special sequences may appear in pattern:\n\n"
    "*          Matches any sequence of characters\n\n"
    "?          Matches any single character\n\n"
    "[chars]    Matches any character in the given set");
spec = feather_usage_add(ops, interp, spec, e);
```

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/builtin_<command>.c` | Add `feather_register_<command>_usage()` function here |
| `src/internal.h` | Add function declaration |
| `src/interp.c` | Call registration function in `feather_register_usage()` |
| `src/builtin_usage.c` | Core usage system implementation |

## Important Reminders

1. **Do not copy TCL docs verbatim** - Feather has significant differences
2. **Explicitly note array limitations** - Arrays are not supported
3. **Verify cross-references** - Only reference commands that exist/will exist
4. **Use paragraph breaks** - `\n\n` for readable multi-paragraph help (single `\n` causes word-wrapping into one paragraph)
5. **Test the output** - Always view the rendered help before committing
6. **Keep it accurate** - Help must match actual Feather behavior
7. **Structurally define subcommands** - Use `feather_usage_cmd()` for each subcommand; do NOT just list them in help text
8. **Always add help to flags** - Every flag needs `feather_usage_help()` to explain its purpose
9. **Flag function has 5 arguments** - `feather_usage_flag(ops, interp, short, long, value)` - use `NULL` for unused parameters
10. **SEE ALSO sections render last** - Custom sections named "See Also" automatically appear after EXAMPLES

## Example Session

```bash
# 1. Check current state
$ echo "usage help set" | ./bin/feather-tester
no usage defined for "set"

# 2. Add usage function to src/builtin_set.c
# 3. Add declaration to src/internal.h
# 4. Add registration call in src/interp.c

# 5. Build and test

set(1)                    General Commands Manual                   set(1)

NAME
       set - Read and write variables
...
