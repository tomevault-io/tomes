# Vue Newsletter Generator

Generate a comprehensive Vue/Nuxt newsletter using parallel subagents to fetch from 25+ sources.

## CRITICAL: Recency Rules

**ALL content MUST be published within the last 14 days (2 weeks). NO EXCEPTIONS.**

- Articles, blog posts, tutorials: **max 14 days old**
- GitHub releases: **max 7 days old**
- Podcast episodes: **max 14 days old**
- Social media posts: **max 7 days old**
- Conference talks: **max 14 days old** (unless announcing upcoming events)

**If a source has no recent content within these windows, report "No recent content" - do NOT include older content to fill space.**

When agents return results, they MUST include publication dates. During synthesis, any item without a verifiable date within the allowed window MUST be excluded.

## Source Tiers

| Tier | Sources | Priority |
|------|---------|----------|
| 1 - Official | GitHub Releases, Vue/Nuxt/Vite/VoidZero Blogs | Highest |
| 2 - Vue Newsletters | Weekly Vue News, Vue.js Feed, Vue.js Developers | High |
| 3 - Community | Hacker News, Reddit, dev.to, Echo JS, Lobsters, **Bluesky** | High |
| 4 - Personalities | Anthony Fu, Daniel Roe, Michael Thiessen | Medium |
| 5 - Media | DejaVue Podcast, Vue Mastery, Vue School | Medium |
| 6 - Ecosystem | GitHub Trending, npm trends, Made with Vue.js | Lower |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Determine Issue Number

```bash
ls ~/Projects/Nuxt/second-brain-nuxt/content/vue-weekly-*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

Next issue = count + 1

Also verify the newsletter publisher exists:
```bash
ls ~/Projects/Nuxt/second-brain-nuxt/content/newsletters/vue-weekly.md
```

### Phase 2: Parallel Data Collection

Spawn **11 agents IN A SINGLE MESSAGE** to fetch all sources in parallel:

---

  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{\"identifier\":\"'$BLUESKY_HANDLE'\",\"password\":\"'$BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD'\"}' \
  | python3 -c \"import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['accessJwt'])\"
```

STEP 2: Search for Vue/Nuxt posts (run these searches with the token)
Use Bash to call the search API with the token from step 1:
- Search 'nuxt' - limit 20
- Search 'vue.js' - limit 20
- Search 'vite' - limit 15
- Search '#vue' hashtag - limit 15

API endpoint: https://bsky.social/xrpc/app.bsky.feed.searchPosts?q={query}&limit={limit}

```

---

**Collect all results** using TaskOutput (blocking) for each agent.

### Phase 3: Content Synthesis

After collecting all data, spawn 2 agents **IN A SINGLE MESSAGE**:

---

**Agent 12 - Section Compiler:**

```
Task tool with subagent_type: "general-purpose"
prompt: "Compile the following raw data into newsletter sections.

CRITICAL DATE FILTER: Today is [INSERT_TODAY_DATE].
- Releases: ONLY from last 7 days (after [INSERT_7_DAYS_AGO])
- Articles/Tutorials: ONLY from last 14 days (after [INSERT_14_DAYS_AGO])
- Podcasts/Videos: ONLY from last 14 days
- Social posts: ONLY from last 7 days

**EXCLUDE any content older than these windows. Better to have fewer items than stale content.**

RAW DATA:
{paste all agent outputs here}

Create these sections in order:
1. ## Releases - Group by package, max 2 releases per package (7 days max)
2. ## Official Announcements - From official blogs, VoidZero (14 days max)
3. ## Community Highlights - Best from HN, Reddit, Lobsters, Bluesky, max 10 items (7 days max)
4. ## Articles & Tutorials - From dev.to, Echo JS, personalities, newsletters, max 10 items (14 days max)
5. ## Podcast & Video - Recent episodes and talks, max 5 items (14 days max)
6. ## Trending Repos - Top 5 trending repositories (this week only)
7. ## Project Showcase - Notable projects from Made with Vue.js, max 3 (14 days max)

Rules:
- **STRICT: Exclude ANY item without a verifiable date within the allowed window**
- Deduplicate: same article appearing on multiple platforms = keep once with highest engagement
- Use markdown links for all URLs
- Keep descriptions concise (1 line max)
- Add brief editorial comment for standout items
- Prioritize: Official > Newsletter picks > HN > Reddit > dev.to
- If a section has no qualifying content, write 'No recent [section type] this week'

Return the compiled markdown sections."
```

---

**Agent 13 - TL;DR Generator:**

```
Task tool with subagent_type: "general-purpose"
prompt: "Generate a TL;DR summary for this newsletter.

NEWSLETTER CONTENT:
{paste compiled sections}

Create:
1. A 1-sentence 'This week in Vue' summary
2. 3-5 bullet points of 'Must-Read' highlights with links
3. A 'Week Theme' if there's a common thread (optional)
4. Any breaking changes or security advisories to highlight

Format as:
## TL;DR

> **This week:** [summary sentence]

**Must-read:**
- [Highlight 1](link)
- [Highlight 2](link)
...

**Week theme:** [theme if applicable]"
```

---

### Phase 4: Assemble Newsletter

Combine all parts into the final newsletter with this structure:

```markdown
---
title: "Vue Weekly #[N] - [START_DATE] - [END_DATE]"
description: "This week in Vue ecosystem"
type: newsletter
newsletter: vue-weekly
issueNumber: [N]
tags:
  - vue
  - nuxt
  - newsletter
  - vue-weekly
authors:
  - alexander-opalic
summary: "[1-sentence summary from TL;DR]"
date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
---

# Vue Weekly #[N]

*[DATE_RANGE] | Your weekly dose of Vue ecosystem news*

[TL;DR section]

[Releases section]

[Official Announcements section - if any]

[Community Highlights section]

[Articles & Tutorials section]

[Podcast & Video section - if any]

[Trending Repos section]

[Project Showcase section - if any]

---

*Curated with care. Found something interesting? Reply to share!*
```

### Phase 5: User Review (BLOCKING GATE)

Present the assembled newsletter to the user.

Use AskUserQuestion tool with options:
- "Looks good - save it"
- "I want to edit some sections"
- "Add more content to a section"
- "Remove some items"

**Do NOT save without explicit user approval.**

### Phase 6: Save & Integrate

After approval, write to:
```
~/Projects/Nuxt/second-brain-nuxt/content/vue-weekly-[N].md
```

Verify the file was created:
```bash
head -20 ~/Projects/Nuxt/second-brain-nuxt/content/vue-weekly-[N].md
```

## Fallback: Python Scripts

If API fetching fails, use the legacy Python scripts as fallback:

```bash
# GitHub releases only
python3 ~/.claude/skills/vue-newsletter/scripts/fetch_github_releases.py

# dev.to articles only
python3 ~/.claude/skills/vue-newsletter/scripts/fetch_devto_articles.py --days 7 --limit 10

# Full generation (limited sources)
python3 ~/.claude/skills/vue-newsletter/scripts/generate_newsletter.py --issue [N]
```

## API Rate Limits

| Source | Endpoint | Limit |
|--------|----------|-------|
| GitHub | api.github.com | 60/hr (5000 with GITHUB_TOKEN) |
| Hacker News | hn.algolia.com | Unlimited |
| Reddit | reddit.com/*.json | Blocked by WebFetch - use WebSearch |
| dev.to | dev.to/api | 30/min |
| Bluesky | bsky.social/xrpc | 3000/5min (authenticated) |
| Echo JS | echojs.com | No limit (scraping) |
| Lobsters | lobste.rs | No limit (scraping) |

## Bluesky Authentication

Requires environment variables (already configured in ~/.zshrc):
- `BLUESKY_HANDLE` - Your Bluesky handle (e.g., alexvue.bsky.social)
- `BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD` - App password from bsky.app/settings/app-passwords

The agent authenticates via `com.atproto.server.createSession` to get a JWT token,
then uses `app.bsky.feed.searchPosts` to search for Vue/Nuxt posts.

## Ranking Algorithm

When deduplicating/ranking content:

```
score = engagement + recency_bonus + source_weight

engagement:
  HN: points + (comments * 0.5)
  Reddit: upvotes + (comments * 0.3)
  Lobsters: points + (comments * 0.5)
  Bluesky: likes + (reposts * 2)
  dev.to: reactions + (comments * 2)

recency_bonus:
  < 1 day old: +20
  1-3 days: +10
  3-7 days: +0
  7-14 days: -10 (articles/podcasts only)
  > 14 days: EXCLUDE (do not include)

source_weight:
  Official blog: +50
  VoidZero blog: +45
  Weekly Vue News pick: +40
  Key personality: +30
  Hacker News: +20
  Bluesky: +18
  Lobsters: +15
  Reddit: +10
  dev.to: +5
  Echo JS: +5
```

## Second Brain Integration

The newsletter uses these frontmatter fields:
- `type: newsletter` - Content type
- `newsletter: vue-weekly` - Links to publisher
- `issueNumber: N` - Sequential issue number
- `authors: [alexander-opalic]` - Curator

Publisher file at `content/newsletters/vue-weekly.md` must exist.

## Social Accounts to Monitor

For manual additions or future automation:

| Platform | Account | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Twitter/X | @vuejs, @nuaboratory | Official accounts |
| Twitter/X | @youyuxi, @antfu7, @danielcroe | Core team |
| Bluesky | @nuxt.com | Official Nuxt account |
| Bluesky | @danielroe.dev | Nuxt lead, 13k+ followers |
| Bluesky | @madewithvuejs.com | Vue project showcases |
| Discord | Vue Land (122k), Nuxt (32k) | Community discussions |

### Bluesky Search Queries Used

The agent searches these terms:
- `nuxt` - Nuxt framework discussions
- `vue.js` - Vue.js discussions
- `vite` - Vite build tool
- `#vue` - Vue hashtag
