# Review CodeRabbit Comments

I have gathered information about the current PR. Here are the results:

<current_branch>
!`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
</current_branch>

<pr_info>
!`gh pr view --json number,title,url 2>/dev/null || echo "No PR found for current branch"`
</pr_info>

<coderabbit_review>
!`gh pr view --json reviews --jq '.reviews[] | select(.author.login == "coderabbitai") | .body' 2>/dev/null | head -500`
</coderabbit_review>

<coderabbit_comments>
!`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)/comments --jq '.[] | select(.user.login == "coderabbitai") | {id: .id, path: .path, line: .line, body: (.body | split("\n")[0:3] | join("\n"))}' 2>/dev/null`
</coderabbit_comments>

## Instructions

### Step 1: Parse CodeRabbit Feedback

1. **Extract actionable comments** from the CodeRabbit review above
2. **Categorize** them into:
   - Code quality issues (type assertions, unclear code)
   - Accessibility issues (missing aria-labels, decorative icons)
   - Design system issues (inconsistent classes, hardcoded values)
   - Bug risks (type safety, null checks)

### Step 2: Validate Each Comment

For each substantive comment, **spawn a subagent** to analyze it in isolation:

```
Use Task tool with subagent_type="general-purpose" for each comment:
- Read the actual file and relevant context
- Check if the suggestion aligns with project conventions (CLAUDE.md)
- Determine verdict: VALID, INVALID, or PARTIALLY VALID
- If partially valid, note what's correct and what's not
```

Launch multiple agents in parallel for efficiency.

### Step 3: Summarize Findings

Create a summary table:

| Comment | File | Verdict | Recommendation |
|---------|------|---------|----------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

Categorize into:
- **Should fix** - Valid suggestions aligned with project guidelines
- **Skip** - Invalid or overly defensive suggestions
- **Needs decision** - Valid but requires user input on approach

### Step 4: Ask for Confirmation

Before implementing, ask the user:
> "I found X valid fixes to implement. Would you like me to proceed?"

### Step 5: Implement Valid Fixes

1. Create a todo list with all fixes
2. Read each file before editing
3. Make the edits
4. Run verification:
   ```bash
   pnpm type-check && pnpm lint
   ```

### Step 6: Resolve CodeRabbit Conversations

After implementing fixes, reply to each CodeRabbit comment to resolve the conversation:

**For FIXED comments** - Reply indicating the fix was applied:
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies \
  -f body="Fixed: [brief description of what was done]"
```

**For INVALID comments** - Reply explaining why it was already correct or not applicable:
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies \
  -f body="Already implemented: [explanation] / Not applicable: [reason]"
```

**For SKIPPED comments** - Reply explaining why it was intentionally skipped:
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies \
  -f body="Skipped: [reason - e.g., inconsistent with codebase patterns, over-defensive, etc.]"
```

Use the comment IDs from the `<coderabbit_comments>` section above.

### Project Guidelines Reference

Key rules from CLAUDE.md to check against:
- NO `any`, `enum`, or type assertions (`as T`)
- Use `tryCatch()` from `@/lib/tryCatch` (not native try/catch)
- Use `RouteNames` from `@/router` (not string literals)
- Features cannot import other features
- shadcn-vue components in `src/components/ui/` must NOT be modified
- Vue 3.5+ APIs required (defineProps destructuring, defineModel, useTemplateRef)
