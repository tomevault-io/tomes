# Version Bump Skill

Manage semantic versioning across the rad-mem project with consistent updates to all version-tracked files.

## Quick Reference

**Files requiring updates (ALL FOUR):**
1. `package.json` (line 3)
2. `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (line 13)
3. `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (line 3)
4. `CLAUDE.md` (line 9 ONLY - version number, NOT version history)

**Semantic versioning:**
- **PATCH** (x.y.Z): Bugfixes only
- **MINOR** (x.Y.0): New features, backward compatible
- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes

## Quick Decision Guide

**What changed?**
- "Fixed a bug" → PATCH (5.3.0 → 5.3.1)
- "Added new feature" → MINOR (5.3.0 → 5.4.0)
- "Breaking change" → MAJOR (5.3.0 → 6.0.0)

**If unclear, ASK THE USER explicitly.**

## Standard Workflow

See [operations/workflow.md](operations/workflow.md) for detailed step-by-step process.

**Quick version:**
1. Determine version type (PATCH/MINOR/MAJOR)
2. Calculate new version from current
3. Preview changes to user
4. Update ALL FOUR files
5. Verify consistency
6. Build and test
7. Commit and create git tag
8. Push and create GitHub release
9. Generate CHANGELOG.md from releases and commit

## Common Scenarios

See [operations/scenarios.md](operations/scenarios.md) for examples:
- Bug fix releases
- New feature releases
- Breaking change releases

## Critical Rules

**ALWAYS:**
- Update ALL FOUR files with matching version numbers
- Create git tag with format `vX.Y.Z`
- Create GitHub release from the tag
- Generate CHANGELOG.md from releases after creating release
- Ask user if version type is unclear

**NEVER:**
- Update only one, two, or three files
- Skip the verification step
- Forget to create git tag or GitHub release
- Add version history entries to CLAUDE.md (that's managed separately)

## Verification Checklist

Before considering the task complete:
- [ ] All FOUR files have matching version numbers
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds
- [ ] Git commit created with all version files
- [ ] Git tag created (format: vX.Y.Z)
- [ ] Commit and tags pushed to remote
- [ ] GitHub release created from the tag
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md generated and committed
- [ ] CLAUDE.md: ONLY line 9 updated (version number), NOT version history

## Reference Commands

```bash
# View current version
grep '"version"' package.json

# Verify consistency across all version files
grep '"version"' package.json .claude-plugin/marketplace.json plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json

# View git tags
git tag -l -n1

# Check what will be committed
git status
git diff package.json .claude-plugin/marketplace.json plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json CLAUDE.md
```
