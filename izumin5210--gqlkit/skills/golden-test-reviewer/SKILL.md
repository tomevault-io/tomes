# Golden Test Reviewer

Skill for reviewing and evaluating gqlkit golden test cases using parallel subagent evaluation.

## Purpose

Systematically evaluate golden test cases under `packages/cli/src/gen-orchestrator/testdata/`, identify issues, and provide concrete fix suggestions. Each test case is evaluated by a dedicated subagent in parallel for efficiency.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Select Review Target

When the review target is not explicitly specified, ask the user (using the runtime's available interaction mechanism) to choose from the following options:

1. **All**: Review all test cases
2. **Category**: Review test cases in a specific category only
   - Basic types (`basic-*`)
   - Scalars (`scalar-*`, `branded-scalar`)
   - Directives (`directive-*`, `deprecated-*`)
   - Interfaces (`interface-*`)
   - Unions (`union-*`)
   - Input types (`input-*`, `oneof-*`)
   - Default values (`default-value-*`)
   - Errors (`*-errors`, `type-error-*`)
3. **Diff**: Review only test cases with changes between current branch and default branch (main)
4. **PR/Branch Review**: Review golden tests affected by a specific PR or branch
   - Reviews test cases modified in the PR/branch
   - Evaluates test coverage for features changed in the PR/branch

#### Detecting Review Mode

When triggered by code review requests (e.g., "review PR #123", "review this branch"), automatically use **PR/Branch Review** mode.

- If PR number is provided: Use `gh pr diff <number>` to get the diff
- If branch name is provided or current branch differs from main: Use `git diff main...<branch>`

#### Getting Changed Test Cases

```bash
# Get test cases with changes (for Diff mode)
git diff main --name-only -- packages/cli/src/gen-orchestrator/testdata/ | \
  sed 's|packages/cli/src/gen-orchestrator/testdata/||' | \
  cut -d'/' -f1 | sort -u

# Get test cases with changes from PR (for PR/Branch Review mode)
gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER> --name-only | \
  grep '^packages/cli/src/gen-orchestrator/testdata/' | \
  sed 's|packages/cli/src/gen-orchestrator/testdata/||' | \
  cut -d'/' -f1 | sort -u

# Get test cases with changes from branch (for PR/Branch Review mode)
git diff main...<branch> --name-only -- packages/cli/src/gen-orchestrator/testdata/ | \
  sed 's|packages/cli/src/gen-orchestrator/testdata/||' | \
  cut -d'/' -f1 | sort -u
```

### Step 1.5: PR/Branch Review - Analyze Diff and Identify Affected Features (PR/Branch Review mode only)

When in PR/Branch Review mode, perform additional analysis to identify affected features and evaluate test coverage.

#### 1.5.1: Get Full Diff

```bash
# For PR
gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER>

# For branch
git diff main...<branch>
```

#### 1.5.2: Identify Affected CLI Components

Analyze the diff to identify which CLI components are affected. Map changed files to feature categories:

| Changed Path | Feature Category |
|--------------|------------------|
| `packages/cli/src/type-extractor/` | Type extraction (interfaces, unions, scalars, etc.) |
| `packages/cli/src/resolver-extractor/` | Resolver extraction |
| `packages/cli/src/schema-generator/` | Schema generation |
| `packages/cli/src/shared/` | Shared utilities (TSDoc, directives, etc.) |
| `packages/runtime/` | Runtime utilities (branded scalars, defineField, etc.) |

#### 1.5.3: Map Features to Test Categories

Based on affected components, determine which test categories should have coverage:

| Component Change | Expected Test Categories |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Interface handling | `interface-*` |
| Union handling | `union-*` |
| Scalar handling | `scalar-*`, `branded-scalar` |
| Directive handling | `directive-*`, `deprecated-*` |
| Input type handling | `input-*`, `oneof-*` |
| Default value handling | `default-value-*` |
| Error handling | `*-errors`, `type-error-*` |
| TSDoc parsing | `tsdoc-*` |

#### 1.5.4: Check Test Coverage

Compare the expected test categories with actually modified/added test cases. Flag gaps where:
- A feature is modified but no corresponding test case is added/modified
- A new feature is added but no test case covers it

This analysis will be included in the final report (Step 3).

### Step 2: Launch Subagents for Parallel Evaluation

For each test case to be reviewed, create a separate subtask with an isolated context (subagent/subtask model) using the runtime's available execution mechanism.

**IMPORTANT**:
- Treat each test case as an independently designed subtask with clear inputs/outputs.
- Execute independent subtasks in parallel when supported by the runtime.
- Pass only minimal required context to each subtask (target test case, relevant diff, and evaluation criteria) to keep context isolated.
- Normalize and aggregate subtask outputs in the final report.

#### Subagent Prompt

Read the prompt template from **`references/subagent-prompt.md`** and use it for each subagent.

**For standard review (All, Category, Diff modes)**:
- Use the first template in `references/subagent-prompt.md`
- Replace `{test-case-name}` with the actual test case name
- Evaluates against 6 criteria (naming, source quality, schema accuracy, resolvers, diagnostics, MECE)

**For PR/Branch Review mode**:
- Use the second template (PR/Branch Review Mode) in `references/subagent-prompt.md`
- Replace placeholders:
  - `{test-case-name}` - actual test case name
  - `{pr-number}` or `{branch-name}` - PR number or branch name
  - `{diff-summary}` - summary of changed files in the PR/branch
  - `{test-case-diff}` - diff content for the specific test case
- Evaluates against 7 criteria (standard 6 + change appropriateness)

#### Example: Launching Multiple Analysis Tasks (Standard Mode)

When reviewing test cases `interface-basic`, `union-type`, and `field-resolver`:

Use the runtime's parallel task mechanism to evaluate these test cases as isolated subtasks concurrently:
- `interface-basic`
- `union-type`
- `field-resolver`

#### Example: Launching Analysis Tasks (PR/Branch Review Mode)

When reviewing test cases modified in PR #123:

Create one isolated subtask per modified test case (`1 test case = 1 isolated subtask`).

For each subtask, provide only:
- target test case name
- PR number or branch name
- diff summary limited to files relevant to that test case
- per-test-case diff
- required evaluation criteria

Do not share full PR/branch-wide cross-case context with every subtask. Cross-case reasoning (e.g., coverage gaps across categories) must be performed only in Step 3 aggregation.

### Step 3: Aggregate Results and Generate Report

After all subagents complete:

1. **Parse JSON results** from each subagent
2. **Generate summary table** showing all test cases at a glance:

```markdown
## Review Summary

| Test Case | Naming | Source | Types | Conversion | Resolvers | Diagnostics | MECE | Issues |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------|------------|-----------|-------------|------|--------|
| interface-basic | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | 1 |
| union-type | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 1 |
| field-resolver | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 0 |
```

3. **List issues by severity** (errors first, then warnings):

```markdown
## Issues Found

### Errors
- **test-case-name**: Description of error (Suggestion: ...)

### Warnings
- **test-case-name**: Description of warning (Suggestion: ...)
```

4. **Provide detailed reports** for test cases with issues (expand from JSON)

   Note: Perform repository-wide or cross-case synthesis only at aggregation time, not inside isolated subtasks.

5. **(PR/Branch Review mode only) Include Test Coverage Analysis**:

```markdown
## Test Coverage Analysis

### Affected Components
| Component | Changed Files |
|-----------|---------------|
| type-extractor | `interface.ts`, `union.ts` |
| schema-generator | `builder.ts` |

### Expected vs Actual Test Coverage
| Feature Category | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------------------|----------|--------|--------|
| Interface handling | `interface-*` | `interface-basic` (modified) | ✅ Covered |
| Union handling | `union-*` | (none) | ⚠️ Missing |

### Coverage Gaps
- **Union handling**: Changes to `type-extractor/union.ts` but no union test cases modified or added
  - Suggestion: Consider adding/updating `union-*` test cases to cover the changes

### Coverage Summary
- Components changed: 2
- Test categories expected: 2
- Test categories covered: 1
- Coverage gaps: 1
```

## Evaluation Ratings

- ✅ **Good** (`"good"`): No issues
- ⚠️ **Warning** (`"warning"`): Room for improvement (functionally correct)
- ❌ **Error** (`"error"`): Fix required

## Test Case Categories

| Category | Prefix | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Basic types | `basic-*` | Basic object types |
| Scalars | `scalar-*`, `branded-scalar` | Custom scalar types |
| Directives | `directive-*`, `deprecated-*` | GraphQL directives |
| Interfaces | `interface-*` | Interface types |
| Unions | `union-*` | Union types |
| Input types | `input-*`, `oneof-*` | Input object types |
| Default values | `default-value-*` | Argument default values |
| Resolvers | `field-resolver` | Field resolvers |
| Errors | `*-errors`, `type-error-*` | Error detection |
| Documentation | `tsdoc-*` | Description from TSDoc |
