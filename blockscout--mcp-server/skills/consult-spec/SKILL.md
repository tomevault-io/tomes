# SPEC.md Consultation Skill

Before implementing any feature or making architectural decisions, consult SPEC.md through an isolated Explore agent to understand the authoritative requirements and design principles.

## Purpose

This skill provides access to SPEC.md (the source of truth for architecture and requirements) through a dedicated subagent that ONLY reads the specification, never the implementation code. This ensures you receive unbiased, authoritative guidance based on requirements rather than potentially incorrect implementations.

## When to Use This Skill

**Use this proactively when you:**

- Begin implementing any feature (check spec requirements first)
- Design API responses or data structures (verify against spec models)
- Make architectural decisions (consult spec design principles)
- Need to understand design rationale for existing patterns
- Encounter conflicting information (get the ground truth)
- Verify technical requirements or constraints
- Check pagination strategies, error handling patterns, or data processing rules

**Do NOT use this when:**

- You need to understand current implementation details (read code directly)
- You need to see how something is actually implemented (that's not the spec's job)
- You're just checking a simple constant or configuration value

## Workflow

### 1. Formulate Your Question

Be specific about what you need from the spec:

**Good questions:**

- "What is the opaque cursor strategy for pagination?"
- "How should log data field truncation work?"
- "What are the design principles for response processing?"
- "What is the standardized ToolResponse model structure?"

**Bad questions:**

- "How is pagination implemented?" (this asks about code, not spec)
- "Tell me everything about transactions" (too broad)

### 2. Spawn the Spec Consultant Subagent

Use the Task tool to create an Explore agent with a minimal prompt that directs it to read its detailed instructions:

```plaintext
Task tool parameters:
- subagent_type: "Explore"
- description: "Consult SPEC.md about <specific topic>"
- prompt: "Read your detailed instructions from .claude/skills/consult-spec/agent-instructions.md,
          then answer this question: <your specific question>"
```

This keeps the main agent context clean while giving the subagent full access to its operating constraints and workflow.

### 3. Resume for Follow-Up Questions

If you need multiple spec queries during the same implementation task:

- Capture the `agentId` from the first Task result
- Use `resume: <agentId>` parameter in subsequent Task calls
- This avoids re-reading SPEC.md and maintains context

### 4. Use the Answer in Your Work

The subagent will return:

- Specific information from SPEC.md
- Line number references (e.g., "lines 285-305")
- Direct quotes from relevant sections
- Design rationale and principles

Use this authoritative guidance to implement features correctly according to the specification.

## Example Usage

**Scenario**: Main agent is implementing a new feature that requires understanding spec requirements

**Main agent thinks**: "I need to understand the spec requirements before implementing this."

**Main agent invokes Task tool**:

```plaintext
subagent_type: "Explore"
description: "Consult SPEC.md about [topic]"
prompt: "Read your detailed instructions from .claude/skills/consult-spec/agent-instructions.md,
        then answer this question: [Your specific question about requirements, architecture, or design principles]"
```

**Subagent responds** (abstract pattern):

```plaintext
The [requested concept/requirement] is defined in lines XXX-YYY of SPEC.md.

Key requirements:
- [First key principle or requirement from the spec]
- [Second key principle or requirement from the spec]
- [Third key principle or requirement from the spec]

Direct quote (lines XXX-YYY):
"[Relevant quote from the specification that clarifies the requirement]"

The [data structure/model/pattern] should contain:
- [component_name]: [description of requirement]
- [component_name]: [description of requirement]

Additional context in lines XXX-YYY explains [related concept].
```

**Main agent uses this**: Implements the feature correctly according to spec requirements

## Important Notes

### Subagent Scope Constraint

The Explore subagent is instructed to ONLY read SPEC.md. This is enforced through:

- Explicit instructions in the subagent prompt
- Clear rationale (provide source-of-truth, avoid implementation bias)
- Behavioral instruction to refuse other file requests

If the subagent attempts to read other files, strengthen the prompt wording or report the issue.

### Why This Matters

SPEC.md is the authoritative source of truth. Implementation code may contain:

- Bugs or deviations from requirements
- Incomplete features
- Temporary workarounds
- Outdated patterns

By consulting SPEC.md through an isolated subagent, you ensure your implementation decisions are based on requirements, not on potentially incorrect existing code.

### When to Read Code Directly

You still need to read implementation code when you're:

- Understanding existing patterns to match coding style
- Debugging specific issues
- Refactoring or modifying existing features
- Learning how a feature is currently implemented

Use SPEC.md consultation for "what should this do?" and code reading for "how is this currently done?"
