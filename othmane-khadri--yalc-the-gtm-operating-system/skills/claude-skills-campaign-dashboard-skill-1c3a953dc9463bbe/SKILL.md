# Campaign Dashboard Skill

Opens the GTM-OS campaign visualization dashboard in the browser — Heyreach/Lemlist-style cards grid with per-lead timelines and variant comparison.

## When This Skill Applies

- "campaign status" / "campaign dashboard"
- "show me campaigns" / "visualize campaigns"
- "what's the state of campaigns"
- "open campaign view" / "campaign pipeline"
- "show me the leads for [campaign name]"
- "how are outreach campaigns doing" (when visual context is implied)

**NOT this skill** (use `campaign-intelligence` instead):
- "campaign report" / "weekly campaign report" → generates a Notion text report
- "compare variants" / "which angle is winning" → text analysis

## What This Skill Does

1. Starts the GTM-OS server (if not already running)
2. Opens the campaign dashboard at `http://localhost:3847/campaigns`
3. Shows campaign cards with live metrics from SQLite
4. Drill into any campaign for per-lead timeline + variant A/B comparison

## What This Skill Does NOT

- Generate Notion reports (that's campaign-intelligence)
- Modify campaigns, leads, or variants
- Send any LinkedIn messages

## Workflow

### Step 1: Start the GTM-OS Dashboard

```bash
npx tsx src/cli/index.ts campaign:dashboard
```

This starts the Hono.js server on port 3847 and opens `/campaigns` in the browser.

### Step 2: If User Wants a Specific Campaign

If the user mentioned a specific campaign name:

1. Query the campaign ID:
```bash
npx tsx -e "
import { db } from './src/lib/db/index.ts';
import { campaigns } from './src/lib/db/schema.ts';
const rows = await db.select({ id: campaigns.id, title: campaigns.title }).from(campaigns);
console.log(JSON.stringify(rows, null, 2));
"
```

2. Open the specific campaign detail page:
```bash
open "http://localhost:3847/campaigns/{campaignId}"
```

### Step 3: Report Back

After opening the dashboard, tell the user:
- The URL that was opened
- A quick summary of what they'll see (number of campaigns, active count, total leads)
- Remind them they can filter by status and search leads in the UI

## Dashboard Pages

| URL | What it shows |
|-----|--------------|
| `/campaigns` | All campaigns as cards with metrics, funnel progress bars, status filters |
| `/campaigns/:id` | Single campaign: variant comparison cards + per-lead horizontal timeline |

## Port

Default: `3847`. If port is in use, pass `--port <number>` to the CLI command.

## Dependencies

- SQLite database with campaign data (`gtm-os.db`)
- No external APIs needed — reads directly from local DB
