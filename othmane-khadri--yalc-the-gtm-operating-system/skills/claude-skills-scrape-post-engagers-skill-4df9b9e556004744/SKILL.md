# Scrape Post Engagers

I'll pull the people who engaged with a LinkedIn post (reactors + commenters) via Unipile, dedupe them across endpoints, and persist the result as a numbered result set you can hand off to `qualify-leads` or `launch-linkedin-campaign`.

## When This Skill Applies

Use this skill when the user says:

- "scrape engagers from this post"
- "who liked this LinkedIn post"
- "who commented on this LinkedIn post"
- "pull engagers from this URL"
- "get the audience of this post"

**NOT this skill** (use `qualify-leads` instead):
- "score these prospects" / "qualify these leads" — qualification runs the 7-gate ICP pipeline on an existing result set, it doesn't fetch new data.

**NOT this skill** (use `personalize-message` instead):
- "write a DM to this engager" / "personalize a message" — that's per-lead copy generation, not audience extraction.

**NOT this skill** (use `launch-linkedin-campaign` instead):
- "send connect requests to these people" / "start outreach" — campaign launch consumes a result set; it doesn't produce one.

## What This Skill Does

1. Validates the LinkedIn post URL (`linkedin.com/posts/...` or `linkedin.com/feed/update/...`).
2. Shells out to `npx tsx src/cli/index.ts leads:scrape-post --url <url>`.
3. The CLI calls Unipile under the hood, fetches reactors + commenters, dedupes them, writes them to the local SQLite DB as a fresh result set, and prints the result set id, totals, and output path.
4. Renders a clean summary and offers to chain into the next step (qualify or launch).

## What This Skill Does NOT

- Send messages, connection requests, or DMs. That's `launch-linkedin-campaign`.
- Score or filter the engagers against an ICP. That's `qualify-leads --result-set <id>`.
- Personalize copy. That's `personalize-message`.
- Edit `.env`, the Unipile DSN, or any config. Read the env, fail loudly if missing.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Ask for the LinkedIn post URL

If the user hasn't pasted a post URL, ask:

> "What's the LinkedIn post URL? I need either the activity URL (`linkedin.com/posts/<handle>_<slug>-activity-...`) or the feed update URL (`linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:...`)."

Don't proceed without a URL. Don't guess from screenshots, post titles, or partial slugs.

### Step 1: Validate URL format

The CLI accepts any URL Unipile resolves, but the supported patterns are:

- `https://www.linkedin.com/posts/<handle>_<slug>-activity-<id>-<suffix>`
- `https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:<id>/`

If the URL doesn't match either shape, ask the user to paste the canonical URL from the post's "Copy link" menu.

### Step 2: Shell out to the CLI

From the gtm-os root (`~/Desktop/gtm-os/`):

```bash
npx tsx src/cli/index.ts leads:scrape-post --url <url>
```

Per the 0.13.0 benchmark, single-command side-effecting skills shell out unconditionally — the import-direct path saves ~10ms but doubles the maintenance surface.

Optional flags worth surfacing if the user asks:

- `--type <both|reactions|comments>` — default `both`. Drop to `reactions` or `comments` only if the user says "just likers" / "just commenters".
- `--max-pages <n>` — default `10`. Bump only if engagement count >1000 reactors expected.
- `--account <name>` — pick a non-default Unipile account (multi-tenant only).
- `--output <path>` — override where the JSON file lands.

Don't pass these flags unless the user asks.

### Step 3: Parse the CLI output

The CLI prints a final block of the form:

```
✓ Scraped <N> engagers (<R> reactors, <C> commenters)
  Result set: <id>
  Output: <path>

Next: yalc-gtm leads:qualify --result-set <id>
```

Capture the result set id, total count, reactor count, commenter count, and output path.

### Step 4: Render a clean summary

Use the format shown in `references/example-output.md`. At minimum:

- Total engagers + breakdown of reactors vs commenters.
- Result set id (the user will need this for the next command).
- Output JSON path (so they can inspect the raw payload).

### Step 5: Offer follow-ups

After the summary, ask:

> "Want me to:
> (a) qualify these leads against your ICP via `qualify-leads --result-set <id>`?
> (b) launch a LinkedIn outreach campaign to them via `launch-linkedin-campaign`?"

Don't run either without a clear yes.

## Notes

- The CLI is gated on the `linkedin` channel being enabled in the user's config — if disabled, the CLI exits with a clear message and this skill surfaces it verbatim.
- Unipile rate limits: caps page-fetches per account-per-hour. If pagination errors mid-flight, the partial result set is still persisted; surface the result set id and tell the user they can re-run with the same URL to top up.
- Dedupe is by canonical LinkedIn profile URL — someone who both liked and commented appears once with `engagement_type` reflecting both signals.
- Never paste Unipile DSNs, account ids, or tokens into chat. They live in `~/.gtm-os/.env`.
