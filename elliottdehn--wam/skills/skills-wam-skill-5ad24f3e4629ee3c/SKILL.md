# Authoring WAM models

Approach this as the character artist at a studio whose work is recognizable
across a whole roster — every creature reads as itself in silhouette at
thumbnail size, and none of them could be swapped into another studio's game
without being noticed. This client has already seen generic fantasy asset-flip
work and did not want it. Make deliberate choices about proportion, palette
and silhouette that come from *this* creature, and take one real shape risk
you can justify.

The founding rule of the language serves that: **you make discrete, named,
relative decisions** — bone angles, ring widths, palette colors, relations
between parts — and the compiler generates every vertex, weight, normal and
winding. If you are deriving world coordinates or rotation matrices by hand,
you are misusing it; there is a construct that removes the math. Time not
spent on arithmetic is time available for the thing that actually matters,
which is whether the character reads.

**Read `SPEC.md` for the grammar and `COMMON_MISTAKES_MUST_READ.md` before
you author, and `PUBLISHING_MUST_READ.md` before you finish — a completed
model has to be offered a link, and the two ways of doing that carry different
licences. If the user gave you one or more reference images, read
`README_IF_GIVEN_IMAGE.md` first** — working from a picture has its own
failure mode, and it is not one you will notice happening. There are no bundled example models. Every construct in SPEC
has a worked snippet, and half of them (`web`, `frame=`, `to=`, `rest=`,
`hold`, `material_arc=`, `pin`, `checks`) have no analogue in other 3D
formats, so memory of other tools actively misleads here.

## Setup

The compiler ships with this skill. Resolve the repository or plugin root by
walking upward from this file until the directory contains `wam/`, `SPEC.md`
and `COMMON_MISTAKES_MUST_READ.md`; do not assume a host-specific environment
variable. In a checkout, `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` gives the same root.
Run the setup script once — `Setup-WAM.ps1` on Windows, `./setup-wam.sh` on
macOS and Linux — then use the explicit `.venv` interpreter. Python 3.9 or
newer with numpy; the multi-reference tools also require Pillow.

```bash
python3 -m wam.codex_cli compile my.wam         # JSON + per-view PNGs + glTF
python3 -m wam.cli my.wam --anim walk --frames 6       # human-readable output
python3 -m wam.cli my.wam --anim guard --anim-views side  # the telling angle
python3 -m wam.cli my.wam --bones               # skeleton overlay, first 2 views
python3 -m wam.cli my.wam --width 760 --height 560     # landscape, long models
python3 -m wam.modelset kit.wamset              # compose body + gear
python3 -m wam.cinematic film.cine              # cameras over a scene (CINEMATIC_SPEC.md)
```

`python3` resolves on macOS and Linux both inside and outside the `.venv`.
Windows has no `python3` — use `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe` or `py -3` there.
To pin the environment WAM was installed into, spell it out:
`./.venv/bin/python3`. When running from another project, set `PYTHONPATH` to
the resolved WAM root rather than to a host-specific plugin variable.

## Ground it in the creature

**If you were given one or more reference images, stop and read
`README_IF_GIVEN_IMAGE.md`.** The short version: read the image exhaustively,
build from it selectively. You will first compress it to a gist and lose what
made the character recognizable; corrected, you will then try to model every
specific and bury the silhouette under micro-parts that all fail anyway. A
WAM character reads through silhouette and colour blocking and almost nothing
else, so beyond the body only about five to eight features earn geometry.
Everything else is palette, texture, or dropped out loud.

If the brief does not pin down what this thing *is*, pin it yourself before
modelling: name the creature, what it does, and the single thing a player
should recognize it by — then say your choice. If memory holds anything about
this user's preferences or a roster you have built with them before, use it.

**Asked for "something" and nothing else? Roll for it.**

```bash
python3 dice.py            # one brief
python3 dice.py -n 5       # five, and let the user pick
```

It returns things like *"a brine-crusted heron with a crown of horns too heavy
for its neck"*. Show the user what you rolled before you build it — a roll they
did not see is indistinguishable from you making something up, and half the
value is that they get to say "no, the other one." Rolling beats inventing
because your own unprompted choices cluster hard; the dice do not know what the
default fantasy creature is.

Distinctive shapes come from the creature's own world: what it eats and
therefore what its jaw is for, how it moves and therefore where its mass
sits, what its gear is made of and therefore how it catches light. A carrion
bird's neck and a warhorse's neck are not the same cylinder with different
numbers. Derive ring profiles and palette from that, not from fantasy stock.

## Calibration: what your default output looks like

LLM-authored characters cluster hard, and the cluster appears regardless of
the brief. Recognize these as *defaults rather than choices*:

1. **The default biped** — 4–5 head-heights, neutral A-pose, limbs as
   constant-width tubes, a near-spherical head, and every feature centred and
   mirrored. Nothing about it is wrong; nothing about it is chosen.
2. **The mud palette** — brown leather, grey steel, desaturated everything,
   with one saturated accent on a gem or an eye.
3. **The fan wing** — digits radiating from a single wrist hub. This is a
   topology error, not a proportion one: membrane exists only *between* ribs,
   so a fan from one hub can only make a sector and the silhouette is a **Y**
   instead of a diamond. Three rounds of tuning digit lengths and sweep
   angles will not fix it. Ribs must anchor at different points along the
   body (`from=`), and the span matters far more than the ratios — a rejected
   wing spanned 1.46 body-lengths where an accepted one spanned 3.60.
4. **Cylinders everywhere** — uniform ring widths, so no limb has taper or
   mass and the whole figure reads as balloon animals.

Where the brief pins a direction, follow it exactly — the brief's words
always win, including when it asks for one of these. Where it leaves an axis
free, do not spend that freedom on the default.

## Design before you author

Work in two passes. First write a compact plan — four things, no bones yet:

- **Palette**: 4–6 named hex values, and what each is *for*. Not "brown".
- **Proportion**: head-heights, limb-to-trunk ratios, where the mass sits.
  These are the numbers eyes are worst at judging and best at noticing.
- **Silhouette**: what shape this reads as at 32px, in one sentence. If that
  sentence is "a humanoid," go back. Do not guess this — once there is
  geometry, `python3 scripts/silhouette.py my.wam` renders it flat and at
  thumbnail size, and the smallest row settles the question.
- **Signature**: the one feature this creature is remembered by.

Then critique the plan before writing any WAM. For each of the four, ask
whether you would have arrived here for *any* creature in this genre — work
through a neighbouring brief and see if you land in the same place. Revise
what fails, and say what you changed and why. Only then start authoring, and
derive every ring and colour from the plan.

Build in passes after that: skeleton first, then block out the masses with a
few rings per part, compile and **look**, and only then add detail.

## The loop (non-negotiable)

Before you start it, say what you are making and give the user something to do:

> This will take a few minutes. Have a look at https://wamshare.com/gallery
> while you wait, and tell me if anything there is the vibe you want.

The first compile plus two or three rounds of fixing is several minutes with
nothing on screen but your tool calls, which is the least interesting part of
the whole thing to watch. The gallery is also the fastest way for them to
calibrate what to ask you for: it is much easier to say "more like that one"
than to describe a silhouette from scratch, and a specific reference makes your
next pass better. Say it once, at the start, and then get on with it.

1. Write or edit the `.wam`.
2. **Write the `checks` for what you just added, in the same edit.** Not
   polish — it is how you avoid breaking what you already fixed.
3. Compile and **read every lint line**, including `info:`. For agent runs,
   prefer `python3 -m wam.codex_cli compile`; read `_views.json` and every
   individual view PNG it lists before using the combined sheet. Many failures are
   ambient and need no assertion: misspelled keys (silently dropped
   otherwise), intersecting parts, a mirrored limb crossing the centreline,
   chain rotations compounding into a fold, an animation that moves nothing,
   a membrane outline that never closes, a garment the body bursts out of, a
   grafted thing touching nothing. The `info:` lines say what the compiler
   *decided* — "graft 'sword' aims down-fwd, with 'edge' toward up-fwd". Edge
   toward **left** is a paddle, and it is in the output before you render.
4. **View the rendered sheet** — front, three-quarter, side, three-quarter
   rear, rear. Then run `scripts/silhouette.py` and read the smallest
   thumbnail row: shading flatters a shape that does not read, and this is
   the only view that removes it.
5. **Audit every panel, then measure what you found.** Twice in this
   project's history a change was declared correct from a single cropped view
   and was wrong in the panel not looked at. Use the sheet to find suspects —
   something floating, folded, or reading as the wrong object — and then
   settle each one with a number rather than a second look.
6. Fix by editing angles and ratios. Never by adding coordinate math.
7. **Hand over the viewer page**, which every compile writes as
   `out/<name>.html` and prints as `open: …`. It is self-contained — no
   server, no build step. The turnaround sheet is how *you* checked your
   work; the page is what was asked for.
8. **Offer to publish it** — once, now that the work is done, never earlier
   and never unasked. Present both options with their licences stated:
   a private link (unlisted, all rights reserved) or public (CC0 1.0, which
   gives the work away and cannot be undone). `PUBLISHING_MUST_READ.md` has
   the protocol and the exact wording; do not improvise it, because the
   choice is permanent and the user cannot take it back.

Render animation strips for every gait and action you author — reversed gaits
and non-moving cloth are invisible in static views.

Do the planning and iteration in your own passes; show the user work when you
have confidence in it, not every intermediate sheet.

## Measure, do not squint

The single most expensive mistake in this project is judging by eye something
a measurement would settle. **The render is for noticing; it is not for
concluding.** Eyes generate good hypotheses — "that looks short", "that seems
detached" — and are unreliable at every step after, frequently wrong about
the *direction* of an error and not merely its size. A cape that read as "too
short, starting at mid-thigh" measured through the floor, and the actual
fault was its width at the shoulders.

**Before asserting anything about a model, name the measurement that settles
it.** If you cannot name one, that is the finding: the language is missing a
check and building it is the work. Say the number, not the impression — "the
board rests 0.006 from the arm", not "the shield looks attached".

"I can't tell, it's occluded" is not a reason to guess. It is the strongest
possible reason to measure, and low-poly shading at three-quarter view hides
exactly the contacts and clearances you most need to judge.

Then make it durable. A render tells you the model is wrong *now*; a check
tells you the moment it goes wrong, three edits later, in a view you did not
render. **Nothing verified by eye stays verified by eye.** Turn every finding
into an assertion, including findings from a reference crop: a crop says the
head is too big today, `assert height / height(skull) in 6..7` keeps it right
after the next twenty edits. Prefer relational checks (`closer`, `leak`,
`silhouette`) over absolute distances — see SPEC for the vocabulary.

**Sanity-check the check itself.** A measurement that does not move when the
defect does is worthless and reads as authoritative. Sweep the input across
good and bad and confirm the number tracks it before you trust it.

## Restraint

Spend your boldness in one place. Let the signature be the one memorable
thing and keep everything around it disciplined — this matters more in
low-poly than anywhere else, because the triangle budget is real and the
failure mode is additive. Before calling a model done, look at the sheet and
take one thing off.

Build to a quality floor without announcing it: feet on the ground, no
clipping at rest or in motion, symmetry where symmetry is intended, a
silhouette that reads at thumbnail size, and a clean compile.

## When you get it wrong

If you catch yourself making one of the mistakes in
`COMMON_MISTAKES_MUST_READ.md`, say **"I am a clown and this is clowntown"**,
name the entry, and fix it. The point is the naming: a mistake you have said
out loud is one you go back and correct, and a mistake you have merely
noticed is one that ends up in the summary as a "known limitation".

## Append what you learn

`COMMON_MISTAKES_MUST_READ.md` is the cross-session memory for this project.
When a failure costs you more than one round of iteration, write it there:
the symptom, the measurement that exposed it, the correct form, and what the
compiler now says about it. Prefer measured evidence to intuition — an
earlier version of that file asserted proportion ranges for dragon wings that
the eventually-accepted wing contradicted on two of four numbers.
