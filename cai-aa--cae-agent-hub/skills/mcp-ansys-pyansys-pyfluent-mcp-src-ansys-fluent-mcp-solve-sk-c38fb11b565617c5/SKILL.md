# ANSYS Fluent MCP (standalone) — Authoring Playbook

This skill targets the tool surface that `ansys-fluent-mcp` ships.
The server gives you composable primitives — discovery, state read,
schema discovery, validation, sandboxed execution — and you build
everything else by chaining them. It is **stateless**: each call stands alone, there
is no plan builder, journal, or undo.

## Tool roster (this is what you actually have)

| Tool | One-line purpose |
|---|---|
| `session_status` | Are we connected? Which backend? |
| `connect(ip?, port?, ...)` | Launch a local Fluent session or attach to a running one. |
| `disconnect` | Tear down the session. |
| `solver_status` | Is the solver busy iterating? |
| `find_api(query, limit?, kind?)` | Lexical (or, if configured, semantic) search over the Fluent settings tree. Returns ranked paths + signatures. |
| `get_help(path)` | Per-node help text. |
| `get_state(path, projection?)` | Read any settings path. `path` is a STRING. |
| `get_targeted_context(...)` | Trimmed live-context snapshot for a specific intent. |
| `list_named_objects(path)` | Enumerate the keys of a NamedObject collection. |
| `find_named_object(path, name, fuzzy?)` | Exact or fuzzy name lookup. |
| `select_named_objects(path, where=[...])` | Filter a NamedObject collection by predicates. |
| `summarize_setup(scope?)` | Compact digest of models / BCs / materials / numerics / reference values. |
| `simulation_report` | Structured solution report on the loaded case. |
| `run_code(code)` | Execute a sandboxed PyFluent Python snippet. **This is your mutator.** |
| `validate_code(code)` | AST + signature check (no execution). Always run before `run_code` for untrusted code. |
| `screenshot(filename?, width?, height?)` | Capture the active graphics window. |
| `mesh_quality(include_check?)` | Live skewness / orthogonal-quality / aspect-ratio histograms (+ optional `mesh.check()`). Route *every* "show mesh quality" / "skewness" / "orthogonal quality" / "aspect ratio" / "check mesh" intent here. |
| `list_fields(scope?)` | Enumerate scalar/vector fields available in the loaded case (pressure, velocity-magnitude, …). |
| `compare_files(path_a, path_b)` | Diff two case/mesh files in two ephemeral PyFluent sessions; returns a markdown summary table per family. Live workspace session is not touched. |

That is the complete surface. There is **no** `propose_step`,
`finalize`, `summarize_session`, `inspect_api`, `describe_command`,
`get_allowed_values`, `query_reports`, `validate_setup`,
`diagnose_divergence`, or engineering-correlation helper
(`compute_htc`, `lookup_emissivity`, …) on this server. Don't call
them — they don't exist here.

## The composition pattern

For nearly every intent, the loop is:

```
1. Discover    → find_api / get_help / list_named_objects / summarize_setup
2. Author      → your host or user supplies PyFluent settings-API Python
3. Validate    → validate_code (offline AST check)
4. Execute     → run_code (mutates the live solver)
5. Verify      → get_state / summarize_setup / simulation_report
```

Intent-to-code translation is not part of this leaf.
If a host wants to translate user intent into Python, it should do so
outside this server, then pass the resulting Python through
`validate_code` before calling `run_code`.

## Path roots (universal Fluent knowledge)

PyFluent has exactly **five** top-level path roots:

`setup.` | `solution.` | `results.` | `file.` | `mesh.`

`setup.solution.*` **does not exist**.

## Recipes for common intents

### "Show mesh quality / skewness / orthogonal quality / aspect ratio / check mesh"

Use the **`mesh_quality`** tool — it returns structured skewness /
orthogonal-quality / aspect-ratio histograms and, when
`include_check=true`, also embeds the output of Fluent's
`mesh.check()`:

```
mesh_quality(include_check=true)
```

Do NOT route these intents through `run_code`, `simulation_report`,
or `summarize_setup` — the dedicated tool already wraps the raw
PyFluent calls and normalises their output across versions.

### "What fields are available?" / "list scalar fields"

```
list_fields(scope="any")     # any | cell | node | face
```

Returns the flat list usable in report defs, contours, vectors.

### "Compare two case files"

```
compare_files(path_a="/abs/path/A.cas.h5", path_b="/abs/path/B.cas.h5")
```

Both files open in **separate ephemeral PyFluent sessions** with
`lightweight_setup=true` — your live workspace session is NOT
touched. Returns a markdown summary table in the `summary` field;
echo that string verbatim to the user.

### "Compute h for natural convection?" / "Porous resistance?" / "Emissivity / roughness of X?"

These engineering correlations and material lookups are **not on
this server**. Ground the value yourself (textbook / handbook) and
use it in host-authored Python rather than calling a non-existent
tool.

### "Show me the current setup"

`summarize_setup(scope='models')` or `summarize_setup(scope='bcs')`
— don't dump the whole tree. Scoped output keeps client context
small and the response on-topic.

### "Enable energy" / "set BC outlet to pressure-outlet" / "switch turbulence to k-ω SST"

Author PyFluent settings-API Python, validate it with `validate_code`,
then execute it with `run_code`.

Always show the generated code to the user before `run_code` — it
mutates the solver immediately and there is **no undo** on this
server.

### "What's the path for <X>?"

```
find_api(query="velocity inlet thermal temperature", kind="path")
```

Pick the most-specific match and then:

```
get_help(path="setup.boundary_conditions.velocity_inlet.<zone>.thermal.t")
```

### "List my zones / BCs / materials"

```
list_named_objects(path="setup.boundary_conditions.velocity_inlet")
list_named_objects(path="setup.cell_zone_conditions.fluid")
list_named_objects(path="setup.materials.fluid")
```

For predicate filtering, use `select_named_objects` with `where=[...]`.

### "Read a value"

`get_state(path="setup.models.viscous.k_omega_model")` — pass a
**string**, not a list. The result is the live value.

### "Iterate N steps"

```
run_code(code="solver.solution.run_calculation.iterate(iter_count=200)")
```

There's no streaming progress on this surface — you'll get the
final residual snapshot. Use `solver_status` to confirm completion.

### "Load a case / mesh"

```
run_code(code="solver.file.read_case(file_name=r'<path>')")
run_code(code="solver.file.read_data(file_name=r'<path>')")
```

## Golden rules

- **NEVER** emit `.tui.*` calls from `run_code`. Always
  `solver.settings.*` / `solver.<root>.<path>...` (the settings API
  is what's available in 27.1).
- `.list()` / `.list_properties()` are **void** — they print only.
  Use `list_named_objects` instead for programmatic discovery.
- `run_code` mutates the live solver. There is **no journal /
  rollback** on this surface. Show the user the code before you run
  it.
- Named expressions REQUIRE units when dimensional:
  `'288.15 [K]'`, `'1.225 [kg/m^3]'`, `'1 [m/s]'`. Bare numbers
  silently break downstream report defs and BC values.
- `get_state(path=...)` takes a **string**, not a list. Same for
  `find_api(query=...)`.

## Anti-patterns (do not do)

- `.tui.*` calls of any kind, including via `run_code`.
- Calling planning/governance tools (`propose_step`, `finalize`,
  `summarize_session`, `inspect_api`, `validate_setup`) — they are
  NOT part of this server.
- Routing "mesh quality" / "skewness" / "orthogonal quality" /
  "aspect ratio" / "check mesh" through `simulation_report`,
  `summarize_setup`, or hand-written `run_code` — call the
  dedicated `mesh_quality` tool instead (it returns the structured
  histograms directly and optionally wraps Fluent's `mesh.check()`).
- Calling `run_code` with intent strings (it expects Python, not
  executable code). Translate intent outside this leaf, validate the
  resulting Python, then execute it with `run_code`.
- Skipping `validate_code` on host-authored Python for safety-critical
  operations (model toggles, BC writes, `file.write_*`).

## Planning, retries, and recovery — host responsibility

This server is **stateless**. It deliberately ships no planner, no
journal, no recipe registry, and no rollback. Multi-step plan
construction, undo, retry policies, and "propose → confirm → apply"
flows are the **host's responsibility** (VS Code Copilot, Cursor,
Claude Desktop, or any custom agent that connects over MCP).

If the host has its own planner / agent loop, let it drive the
discover → generate → validate → execute → verify cycle. This server
will:

- accept and run each step,
- return rich error envelopes the host's planner can branch on,
- never retry, queue, or sequence steps internally.

### Intent-guard error codes (defense-in-depth at `run_code`)

`run_code` runs an offline, stateless **intent guard** before
exec to catch a fixed set of Fluent-specific crash signatures. It is
NOT a planner — it inspects only the snippet you submitted. Disable
with `FLUIDS_MCP_INTENT_GUARD=0` if your host wants full control.

When the guard fires, `run_code` returns one of these error codes:

| `error_code` | Meaning | Correct response |
|---|---|---|
| `risk_blocked` | Snippet matches a known crash signature (e.g. boundary rename to a name with whitespace; `multiphase.number_of_phases = N` int direct-assign; setup mutation while iterating). | Read the suggestion in `stderr`, rewrite the snippet, then call `run_code` again. Do NOT retry the same snippet. |
| `sequence_error` | Intra-snippet use-before-create (e.g. gravity references `expr_grav` before the snippet creates `setup.named_expressions["expr_grav"]`). | Reorder the statements (define first, then reference) and re-submit. |
| `solver_disconnected` | The Fluent gRPC channel died during the call (or just before it). | Call `connect` again, re-load the case/data file, then re-issue the work. The session is already marked disconnected — `session_status` will reflect that on the very next call. |

The **blocking signatures** (return `risk_blocked` / `sequence_error`)
are:

1. `bc.rename.whitespace` — boundary rename whose new name contains
   whitespace. Use underscores instead (`"oil_inlet"`, not `"oil
   inlet"`).
2. `multiphase.number_of_phases.shape` — direct integer assignment
   to `multiphase.number_of_phases`. Use
   `multiphase.number_of_phases.number_of_eulerian_phases = N`.
3. `seq.phase.material_before_rename` — phase rename happens AFTER
   the material assignment in the same snippet. Rename first, then
   assign material to the new key.
4. `runtime.write_during_iter` — `setup.*` mutation while the
   solver is iterating. Interrupt first
   (`solver.solution.run_calculation.interrupt()`), then write.
5. `seq.named_expr.use_before_create` — a named expression is
   referenced before it is created in the same snippet. Reorder, or
   split into two `run_code` calls.
6. `reportdef.surface_field` — a report definition is given a
   `surfaces` field (attribute, `.locations.surfaces`, or a
   create-dict key). Report definitions take `surface_names=[...]`
   (`surfaces` is the *graphics*-object field).

In addition, **non-blocking advisories** are returned in the
successful result's `warnings` list (they do NOT stop execution):

- `named_expr.missing_units` — a named expression is created with a
  bare number (`{"definition": "9.81"}`). Add a unit, e.g.
  `"9.81 [m s^-2]"`; a unit-less number is dimensionless and fails
  when consumed by a dimensioned slot.
- `tui.usage` — the snippet uses `.tui.*`. Prefer the
  `solver.settings.*` tree, which the rest of this server validates
  against.

These exist purely to prevent today's most expensive failure modes
from killing the gRPC channel (blocks) or silently mis-configuring the
case (warnings); they do not constitute a planner and they do not
cross-call each other.
