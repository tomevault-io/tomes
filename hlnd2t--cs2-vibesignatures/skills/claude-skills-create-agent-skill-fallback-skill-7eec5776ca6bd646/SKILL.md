# Create an Agent SKILL.md Fallback for a Finder

Given a target `find-XXXX` finder whose preprocessor uses a fragile foundation (most often **LLM_DECOMPILE**),
author `.claude/skills/find-XXXX/SKILL.md` — the **Agent fallback** that `ida_analyze_bin.py` runs only when the
preprocessor returns failure. The preprocessor stays as-is; this skill adds a durable backstop beside it.

This is the robustness-oriented sibling of `/convert-finder-skill-to-preprocessor-scripts` (that skill turns a
SKILL.md *into* a preprocessor; this one gives a preprocessor a SKILL.md *fallback*).

## When to Use

- A `find-XXXX` finder failed on a new game version because a member/vfunc/function was **inlined or
  de-inlined** relative to what its LLM_DECOMPILE reference expects (classic symptom: one target in a
  multi-target `-decompiles` skill can no longer be found, aborting the module).
- You want to **pre-emptively** backstop an LLM_DECOMPILE-based finder (patterns C/D/E) whose correctness hinges
  on a predecessor keeping a fixed decompiled shape.
- The recipe also applies to xref-string / found_call / index-based finders — the foundation differs, but the
  same "self-contained, skip-existing, anchor semantically, follow the callee" method holds.

Do **not** use this to replace a working preprocessor. The fallback is a safety net; the preprocessor remains
the fast path.

## The one constraint that drives the whole design

When the preprocessor fails, `agent_runner.run_skill` launches the agent with a prompt of **only
`/{skill_name}`** (see `_build_claude_command`, profile `sig-finder`). The skill's `expected_yaml_paths` is used
**only** for post-run missing-file verification (`_missing_expected_outputs` / `_result_failure_reason`) — it is
**never** injected into the prompt, and the missing list is not fed back to the agent on retry.

Consequence: the fallback SKILL.md you generate MUST be **fully self-contained**. It must enumerate every
output, gate each by platform, and tell the agent to **skip outputs whose YAML already exists** (the
preprocessor may have written most of them before failing; earlier fallback skills may have written others).

## Inputs to gather (read these before writing anything)

For target finder `find-XXXX` in module `<module>` (`server`, `engine`, `networksystem`, …):

1. **Preprocessor** `ida_preprocessor_scripts/find-XXXX.py` — the source of truth for *what* to find:
   - `TARGET_FUNCTION_NAMES`, `TARGET_STRUCT_MEMBER_NAMES`, `TARGET_GLOBALVAR_NAMES` and any
     `*_WINDOWS` / `*_LINUX` variants → the output symbols and their **platform gating**.
   - `LLM_DECOMPILE` (and `_WINDOWS`/`_LINUX`) → the **predecessor** reference each target is mined from
     (`references/<module>/<predecessor>.{platform}.yaml`).
   - `FUNC_VTABLE_RELATIONS` → which targets are vtable-related (`vtable_name`).
   - `GENERATE_YAML_DESIRED_FIELDS` → the **exact fields and kind** for each target (this tells you whether a
     target is a struct member, an indirect-vcall vfunc, a real vfunc, a regular func, or a global var — see the
     kind table below).
   - any `FUNC_XREFS` (string/gv anchors) — extra fingerprints you can reuse.
2. **`configs/<GAMEVER>.yaml` skill entry** — `expected_output` / `expected_output_windows` / `expected_output_linux`
   (authoritative output list per platform), `expected_input` (the predecessor YAML), `platform`,
   `prerequisite`.
3. **Reference YAMLs** `ida_preprocessor_scripts/references/<module>/<predecessor>.{platform}.yaml` — the
   `disasm_code` + `procedure` carry the annotations `; 0xNN = Class::member` and
   `; 0xNN = Class::vfunc` / `// NNNN = 0xNN = …` at each access/call site. **These annotations are the semantic
   fingerprints** you translate into the fallback's anchors. Also collect any real-world helper or alternate
   inline/de-inline reference YAML that materially helps locate the targets.
4. **Ground-truth output YAMLs** `bin/<gamever>/<module>/<target>.{platform}.yaml` — the **authoritative**
   offsets, vfunc indices, and signature styles the finder currently produces. Mine these for the reference
   values in the inventory table. `<gamever>` comes from `.env` (`CS2VIBE_GAMEVER`); `bin/` is gitignored, so
   read whatever versions exist. Document these as *reference values that change per update and per platform* —
   never as fixed answers.

Cross-check every value across the reference annotation AND the ground-truth YAML; where they disagree, trust
the ground-truth YAML and note the discrepancy (references occasionally mis-annotate — see the decoy caution).

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Build the output inventory

From the preprocessor `.py` + config entry, list every output as `(symbol, kind, platform, predecessor,
desired-fields)`. Determine `kind` from `GENERATE_YAML_DESIRED_FIELDS` using this table:

| Kind | Tell-tale desired fields | Sig-gen skill | Writer skill |
|------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| struct member | `struct_name, member_name, offset, offset_sig[, size, offset_sig_disp]` | `/generate-signature-for-structoffset` | `/write-structoffset-as-yaml` |
| indirect vcall (`call [reg+disp]`, no body) | `vfunc_sig, vfunc_offset, vfunc_index, vtable_name` and **no** `func_va`/`func_sig` | `/generate-signature-for-vfuncoffset` | `/write-vfunc-as-yaml` (`func_addr=None`, `func_sig=None`) |
| real vtable vfunc (has a body) | `func_va/func_sig` **and** `vtable_name/vfunc_offset/vfunc_index` | `/generate-signature-for-function` | `/write-vfunc-as-yaml` (+ vtable fields) |
| regular function | `func_name, func_sig, func_va, func_rva, func_size` (no vtable fields) | `/generate-signature-for-function` | `/write-func-as-yaml` |
| global variable | `gv_name, gv_va, gv_sig, gv_inst_*` | `/generate-signature-for-globalvar` | `/write-globalvar-as-yaml` |

The indirect-vcall kind is easy to miss: its YAML has **no `func_va`** and its `vfunc_sig` is the signature of
the *call instruction itself* (e.g. `FF 90 A0 00 00 00` = `call qword ptr [rax+0A0h]`), not of any target
function body. Treat it as such — do not try to resolve a concrete implementation address.

### Step 2 — Confirm platform gating and the predecessor

From the config entry, record which outputs are cross-platform vs `expected_output_windows` /
`expected_output_linux`, and the predecessor(s) from `expected_input`. A symbol that is de-inlined into a
separate function on one platform but inlined on the other is common (that asymmetry is often *why* the finder
is fragile).

### Step 3 — Extract per-target fingerprints

For each target, read its access/call site in the reference `disasm_code` + `procedure` and write down:
- the **semantic anchor**: the nearest stable landmark — a string literal, a magic constant, a named
  global/interface call, a distinctive helper — that identifies the site independent of address;
- the **`this`-relative offset** (members) or **call displacement** (indirect vcalls) or **vtable index**;
- the **reference value** from the ground-truth `bin/` YAML (both platforms where they differ).

### Step 4 — Write the fallback SKILL.md

Create `.claude/skills/find-XXXX/SKILL.md` from the template below. Fill every placeholder; keep only the
target kinds that actually occur. The output filename MUST equal the finder's skill name so
`agent_runner.run_skill` finds it.

The generated fallback MUST contain `## Realworld Function References` near the top, before the background.
List one exact repo-relative YAML path per bullet for every platform-relevant predecessor and useful
inline/de-inline helper or variant. Spell out `.windows.yaml` and `.linux.yaml` paths separately; do not use
`{platform}` shorthand in this section, because the agent must be able to open each reference directly. State
that addresses and offsets are reference-build values that still require verification against the current
binary.

### Step 5 — Validate

- `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -b` (guard; a pure-doc addition should not affect tests).
- Re-read the generated SKILL.md against the inventory: is every output listed, platform-gated, and mapped to a
  sig-gen + writer skill with correct params?
- Run the fallback itself in the real IDA/MCP environment, bypassing both old-version reuse and preprocessing:

  ```bash
  uv run ida_analyze_bin.py -gamever <gamever> -oldgamever none -modules=<module> -debug -skip_pp -skill=<skill_name>
  ```

  The selected game version must contain the module binary and every configured `expected_input`. Ensure at
  least one expected output for each tested platform is absent; if all outputs already exist, use a disposable
  game-version copy or temporarily back up the target outputs outside the binary directory and restore them
  afterward. A run that says all outputs already exist and skips the skill is **not** a valid Agent-Skill-only
  test.
- Require the log to show `Agent Skill only mode: enabled (-skip_pp)`, `Skipping preprocess: <skill_name>
  (-skip_pp)`, and `Starting agent skill: <skill_name>`, followed by `Success` and summary `Failed: 0`. Verify
  that every expected YAML for the tested platform was produced and parses as a non-empty mapping.

Do not report the fallback as complete unless this end-to-end Agent-Skill-only test passes. If the real IDA/MCP
environment is unavailable, report the validation as blocked rather than substituting a preprocessor run or a
ground-truth-only review.

### Step 6 — Run post-change gates

After the end-to-end fallback test has produced and verified its YAMLs, run these skills in order:

1. **ALWAYS** Use SKILL `/prepare-post-change-candidate` with the tested `gamever`. Retain its candidate, candidate
   session, and gamedata session paths.
2. **ALWAYS** Use SKILL `/post-change-validation` with the same `gamever`, candidate, and candidate session.
3. Only after validation succeeds, **ALWAYS** Use SKILL `/publish-post-change-candidate` with the same `gamever`,
   candidate, candidate session, and gamedata session.

These calls replace direct formatting, gamedata update, C++ validation, and snapshot-pack commands. If any gate
fails, stop the entire task and do not commit.

### Step 7 — Commit

If on `main`, branch to `dev` first. Review `git status --short`, then stage the new SKILL.md, changed tracked
gamedata files, and `gamesymbols/<gamever>.yaml` **explicitly**; never use `git add -A`. Commit with:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(fallback): add find-XXXX skill" -m "Co-Authored-By: Codex (GPT-5.x)"
```

Then record a one-line memory pointer per the repo workflow.

# Find XXXX (final-guarantee fallback)

Recover every symbol the find-XXXX preprocessor produces, in CS2 `<binary.dll>` / `<libbinary.so>`, using IDA
Pro MCP tools. This is the Agent fallback: it runs only when the preprocessor returned failure — which almost
always means a target's access pattern **moved** across the inline/de-inline boundary.

## Realworld Function References

Read the platform-relevant real-world YAMLs before searching in IDA. Treat their addresses and offsets as
reference-build values only; verify every result against the current binary.

- `ida_preprocessor_scripts/references/<module>/<predecessor>.windows.yaml`
- `ida_preprocessor_scripts/references/<module>/<predecessor>.linux.yaml`
- `ida_preprocessor_scripts/references/<module>/<relevant-helper-or-variant>.windows.yaml`
- `ida_preprocessor_scripts/references/<module>/<relevant-helper-or-variant>.linux.yaml`

Spell out each existing path literally and drop non-applicable placeholders or platforms.

## Background — <PREDECESSOR> and what it wires up

<2–5 sentences: what the predecessor does and which targets it touches, in source terms. Note that all member
accesses are relative to `this` (arg1: rcx/rsi on Windows, rdi/rbx on Linux) — the key to robustness.>

## Robustness principle — follow the de-inline boundary

For every target: (1) look for its access pattern inside `<PREDECESSOR>`; (2) if absent, it was de-inlined —
enumerate the functions `<PREDECESSOR>` calls, decompile the plausible ones, and search there (the helper
receives `this` as its first argument, so the same `this + offset` reappears; recurse a level or two);
(3) conversely a target the reference expected in a separate function may have been inlined back into
`<PREDECESSOR>`. Anchor each target by its semantic fingerprint (string / constant / neighboring call), never by
a fixed address or containing function.

## Output inventory

`struct_name` is `<STRUCT>` where applicable. Offsets/indices are **reference values from build <gamever> —
verify against the binary, do not assume**.

| # | Output symbol | Kind | Windows | Linux | Writer skill |
|---|---------------|------|---------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | `<symbol>` | <kind> | `<value or "inlined — skip">` | `<value or "inlined — skip">` | `/write-...-as-yaml` |
| … | | | | | |

Platform gating: <list cross-platform vs windows-only / linux-only outputs>.

## Step 0. Skip targets already produced

For each output, if `<name>.<platform>.yaml` already exists beside the binary and parses to a non-empty mapping,
skip it — the preprocessor or an earlier fallback wrote it. List the directory with:

```
mcp__ida-pro-mcp__py_eval code="import idaapi, os; d=os.path.dirname(idaapi.get_input_file_path()); print('\n'.join(sorted(f for f in os.listdir(d) if f.endswith('.yaml'))))"
```

`/get-func-from-yaml` also reports existence for functions/vfuncs.

## Step 1. Load and decompile the predecessor

**ALWAYS** Use SKILL `/get-func-from-yaml` with `func_name=<PREDECESSOR>` to get its `func_va`. If it errors,
**STOP** and report to user. Then:

```
mcp__ida-pro-mcp__decompile addr="<PREDECESSOR.func_va>"
```

Note the `this` register and keep the list of called functions for the de-inline search.

## Step 2…N. Resolve each target

<One subsection per target (or per cluster sharing a call site). For each: the semantic anchor, the
this-relative offset / call displacement / vtable index, the reference value, and how to handle de-inline. Note
any decoys.>

## Signatures and YAML output

<Per kind, the sig-gen skill + writer skill + exact params — copy from the kind table. E.g. struct members →
/generate-signature-for-structoffset → /write-structoffset-as-yaml with struct_name/member_name/offset/size=None/
offset_sig/offset_sig_disp; indirect vcalls → /generate-signature-for-vfuncoffset → /write-vfunc-as-yaml with
func_addr=None, func_sig=None, vfunc_sig, vtable_name, vfunc_offset, vfunc_index=offset/8.>

## Failure handling

- Predecessor YAML missing → **STOP** and report.
- A required target unresolved even after following callees → resolve the rest, then **STOP** and report exactly
  which output(s) failed so the user can extend the references.
- Never emit a platform-gated symbol on the wrong platform.

## Output YAML filenames

Written beside the binary, one per symbol: `<symbol>.windows.yaml` / `<symbol>.linux.yaml`.

## Robustness principles (the heart of a good fallback)

1. **Anchor semantically, not positionally.** A fixed address or "it's in function F" breaks on the next update.
   A string literal, a magic constant (e.g. an FNV seed `0x811C9DC5`), a named interface call, or a distinctive
   helper survives.
2. **`this + offset` is stable across the inline boundary.** Struct offsets are relative to the class pointer
   (arg1). Whether the access is inlined in the predecessor or de-inlined into a helper that receives `this`,
   the same `this + offset` appears — so members are recoverable either way.
3. **Follow the callee (the core move).** If a target isn't in the predecessor, enumerate the predecessor's
   calls, decompile them, and recurse. This is what makes the fallback a *guarantee* rather than a re-run of the
   fragile reference match. Cover the inline-back case too.
4. **Know the indirect-vcall shape.** For `call qword ptr [reg + disp]` on an interface pointer, the output is
   `vtable_name` + `vfunc_offset = disp` + `vfunc_index = disp/8` + a `vfunc_sig` pinning the call instruction;
   there is **no `func_va`**. Resolve the interface from the receiver global's type.
5. **Watch for decoys.** References sometimes annotate two nearby offsets with the same member name. Trust the
   ground-truth `bin/` YAML. (Real example: `CEntitySystem::m_eNetworkSerializationMode` is the DWORD at
   `0xBBC`, set from the mode param and re-read at the SetNetworkSerializationContextData call — **not** the byte
   flag at `0xBDA`, even though the reference labels both.)
6. **The offset is the must-have; the signature is best-effort.** For struct members, `offset` is the required
   output; `offset_sig` is for relocation and may legitimately be omitted (write offset only) when a unique
   signature can't be found — especially for members whose access spans a function boundary.

## Checklist

- [ ] Read the target preprocessor `.py`, its config entry, its reference YAMLs, and its `bin/` ground-truth
      output YAMLs.
- [ ] Output inventory lists **every** symbol with kind + platform + predecessor + reference value.
- [ ] Fallback SKILL.md filename equals the finder's skill name.
- [ ] `## Realworld Function References` lists exact, directly openable repo-relative YAML paths for each
      relevant platform and inline/de-inline helper or variant; it contains no `{platform}` shorthand.
- [ ] SKILL.md is self-contained: enumerates all outputs, gates by platform, has the Step-0 skip-existing step.
- [ ] Each target has a semantic anchor and the follow-the-callee instruction; decoys are called out.
- [ ] Each kind is mapped to the correct sig-gen + writer skill with correct params (indirect vcalls use
      `func_addr=None`/`func_sig=None` + `vfunc_sig`).
- [ ] Failure handling + output-filename sections present.
- [ ] `unittest discover -s tests -b` passes.
- [ ] Values cross-checked against `bin/` ground truth.
- [ ] Real Agent-Skill-only test passed with `uv run ida_analyze_bin.py -gamever <gamever> -oldgamever none
      -modules=<module> -debug -skip_pp -skill=<skill_name>`; the log proves preprocessing was skipped, the
      Agent Skill actually started, all expected YAMLs were produced, and the summary reports `Failed: 0`.
- [ ] `/prepare-post-change-candidate` succeeds for the tested game version.
- [ ] `/post-change-validation` succeeds for the same game version.
- [ ] `/publish-post-change-candidate` publishes `gamesymbols/<gamever>.yaml`.
- [ ] New SKILL.md, gamedata, and snapshot staged explicitly and committed on `dev`; memory pointer recorded.

## Worked example — `find-CEntitySystem_Init-decompiles`

The canonical output of this workflow lives at
`.claude/skills/find-CEntitySystem_Init-decompiles/SKILL.md` (commit `a31fdf4`). Study it as the reference.

- **Fragile foundation:** `ida_preprocessor_scripts/find-CEntitySystem_Init-decompiles.py` mines 11 targets by
  LLM_DECOMPILE off one predecessor, `CEntitySystem_Init`
  (reference `references/server/CEntitySystem_Init.{platform}.yaml`).
- **What broke:** on Windows 14168, `CEntitySystem_InitEntityMaterialAttributes` was de-inlined out of
  `CEntitySystem_Init`, so the `m_EntityMaterialAttributes` access left the predecessor and the LLM match
  failed, aborting the module.
- **What the fallback covers:** all 11 targets — 7 cross-platform struct members, 2 indirect-vcall vtable
  offsets (`INetworkMessages_SetNetworkSerializationContextData` @0xA0/idx20,
  `IFlattenedSerializers_CreateFieldChangedEventQueue` @0x118/idx35), Linux-only
  `CEntitySystem_ProcessEntityRegistration`, and Windows-only `m_EntityMaterialAttributes` (@0x2070) — each
  anchored by a fingerprint (the `"string_t_table"` call, the `CUtlScratchMemoryPool::Init(_, 0x400, …)` call,
  the FNV material-hash loop, …) and recoverable whether inlined or de-inlined.
- It demonstrates every section of the template: directly openable real-world function references, the
  inventory table, Step-0 skip, follow-the-callee, the indirect-vcall shape, the `0xBBC`-vs-`0xBDA` decoy note,
  and the offset-is-must-have caveat for the field-change trio.
