# Cleanup Workspace

Post-merge housekeeping: verify the active dev branch landed in `main`, then prune it locally and on `origin`.

## When to Use

After a pull request authored on a `dev*` branch has been merged into `main` and the user wants to return the workspace to a clean state on the updated `main` branch.

## Safety Rules

- **NEVER** delete a branch that is not fully merged into `origin/main`. If the merge check fails, STOP immediately and report to the user — do not pass `-D` to force delete.
- **NEVER** run on `main` itself. If the current branch is `main`, abort with a clear message.
- **NEVER** discard uncommitted changes. If the working tree is dirty, abort and ask the user to commit or stash first.
- The remote name is assumed to be `origin`. If `origin` is not present, abort and ask the user which remote to use.

## Method

### Step 1 — Capture state and validate preconditions

Run these checks in parallel:

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD          # current branch name
git status --porcelain                   # must be empty (clean working tree)
git remote                               # must contain 'origin'
```

Abort with a clear message if:
- Current branch is `main` (nothing to clean up).
- `git status --porcelain` is non-empty (uncommitted changes).
- `origin` remote does not exist.

Save the current branch name as `DEV_BRANCH` for later steps.

### Step 2 — Fetch latest refs and verify merge status

```bash
git fetch origin --prune
```

Then check whether every commit on `DEV_BRANCH` is reachable from `origin/main`:

```bash
git merge-base --is-ancestor <DEV_BRANCH> origin/main
```

- Exit code `0` → branch is fully merged. Proceed to Step 3.
- Exit code `1` → branch has commits not in `origin/main`. **STOP** and report to the user:
  - Show the unmerged commits: `git log --oneline origin/main..<DEV_BRANCH>`
  - Tell the user the branch is not merged and the skill will not delete it.
  - Do **not** continue to subsequent steps.

### Step 3 — Switch to main and pull

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main --ff-only
```

Use `--ff-only` so the pull aborts cleanly if something unexpected happened upstream rather than creating a merge commit silently.

### Step 4 — Delete the local dev branch

```bash
git branch -d <DEV_BRANCH>
```

Use lowercase `-d` (safe delete). It refuses to delete if not merged — which should not happen since Step 2 already verified the merge, but the double-check is intentional. Do **not** fall back to `-D`.

### Step 5 — Delete the remote dev branch if it still exists

First check whether the remote branch is still present (the maintainer may have already deleted it after merging the PR):

```bash
git ls-remote --heads origin <DEV_BRANCH>
```

- Output empty → remote already deleted. Skip the delete and report "remote branch already removed".
- Output non-empty → delete it:

```bash
git push origin --delete <DEV_BRANCH>
```

If the push fails (permission denied, protected branch, etc.), report the error to the user — do not retry with force.

### Step 6 — Report final state

Summarize what changed in a short message:
- Current branch (should be `main`) and its short SHA.
- Whether the local dev branch was deleted.
- Whether the remote dev branch was deleted or was already gone.

## Example Walk-through

User finishes work on `dev-14156` which has been merged into `main` via PR:

```
Step 1: HEAD=dev-14156, working tree clean, origin present.        ✓
Step 2: git fetch origin --prune
        git merge-base --is-ancestor dev-14156 origin/main → 0     ✓ merged
Step 3: git checkout main
        git pull origin main --ff-only                              → main now at <sha>
Step 4: git branch -d dev-14156                                     → deleted
Step 5: git ls-remote --heads origin dev-14156 → non-empty
        git push origin --delete dev-14156                          → deleted
Step 6: Report: on main @ <sha>; local dev-14156 deleted; remote dev-14156 deleted.
```

## Notes

- The skill is a pure git workflow — no IDA Pro MCP or codebase analysis is involved.
- If the user wants to clean up a *different* branch than the one currently checked out, they should switch to it first; this skill only operates on `HEAD`.
- The skill never force-deletes (`-D`) or force-pushes. If a step refuses, that is a signal to stop and surface the situation, not to override.
