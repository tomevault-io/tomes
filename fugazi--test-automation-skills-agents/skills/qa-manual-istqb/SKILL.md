# ISTQB Manual & Automation QA Toolkit

Complete ISTQB Foundation Level (CTFL) aligned workflow for QA test engineers covering:
**Test Planning → Test Analysis → Test Design → Test Implementation → Test Execution → Test Completion**

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating or reviewing **test plans** and **test strategies**
- Generating **test conditions** and **test cases** from requirements
- Applying **test design techniques** (EP, BVA, decision tables, state transitions, use cases)
- Writing **bug reports** and managing **defect lifecycle**
- Building **regression suites** with risk-based selection
- Creating **traceability matrices** (requirements ↔ tests ↔ defects)
- Conducting **exploratory testing** sessions with charters
- Estimating test effort using ISTQB techniques
- Reviewing testware through **static testing** practices
- Implementing automation with **Playwright** (TypeScript)

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| Node.js 18+ | Required for CLI script and Playwright |
| Playwright | `npm init playwright@latest` for automation |
| Text editor | For creating/editing markdown and CSV artifacts |
| Git | Recommended for testware version control |

## Quick Start (choose one)

- Create a test plan: use `assets/templates/test-plan.md` as a starting point.
- Create a test summary report: use `assets/templates/test-summary-report.md`.
- Generate test cases: use `assets/templates/test-cases.csv` and fill it from the test basis (requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria).
- Create a bug report: use `assets/templates/bug-report.md`.
- Create a bug log: use `assets/templates/bug-log.csv`.
- Create traceability: use `assets/templates/traceability-matrix.csv`.
- Build a regression suite definition: use `assets/templates/regression-suite.md`.
- Scaffold Playwright tests: use `assets/templates/playwright-spec.ts` and adapt to the system under test.
- Run exploratory testing: use `assets/templates/exploratory-charter.md` to timebox and capture outcomes.

If running locally, generate artifacts with the bundled CLI:

```bash
node scripts/qa_artifacts.mjs list
node scripts/qa_artifacts.mjs create test-plan --out specs --project "My App" --release "R1"
node scripts/qa_artifacts.mjs create test-cases --out specs --feature "Checkout"
node scripts/qa_artifacts.mjs create bug-report --out specs/bugs --title "Search returns 500"
```

## Inputs to collect (ask if missing)

- **Test basis**: requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, designs, risk register, defect history.
- **Scope**: in-scope/out-of-scope features, target platforms/browsers/devices, locales, accessibility, integrations.
- **Quality risks**: what can fail, impact, likelihood, regulatory/compliance, critical user journeys.
- **Constraints**: deadlines, environments, data availability, tooling, access/roles, CI/CD expectations.
- **Definitions**: severity vs priority scale, test levels and test types to cover, entry/exit criteria.

## Workflows

### 1) Create a test plan (and/or test strategy)

1. Identify test objectives, scope, assumptions, and constraints from the test basis.
2. Define test levels and types (functional + change-related + key non-functional, as applicable).
3. Choose test design techniques per area (see `references/test-design-techniques.md`).
4. Specify environments, test data, tooling, and configuration management needs.
5. Define entry/exit criteria, deliverables, and reporting cadence/metrics.
6. Add a risk matrix and mitigation actions; prioritize testing accordingly (risk-based testing).

Use: `assets/templates/test-plan.md` (detailed sections + checklists).

### 2) Generate test conditions and test cases

1. Convert the test basis into **test conditions** (what to test) before writing step-by-step cases.
2. For each condition, pick a technique:
   - Equivalence partitions and boundary values for inputs/validation.
   - Decision tables for rule combinations.
   - State transitions for lifecycle/flows.
   - Use-case/scenario tests for end-to-end journeys.
   - Exploratory testing sessions to learn quickly (see `assets/templates/exploratory-charter.md`).
3. Write test cases that are atomic, unambiguous, and traceable to requirement/user story IDs.
4. Add expected results that are observable and measurable (define the test oracle).
5. Add priority and risk tags to support risk-based regression selection.
6. Mark automation candidates using stability + value criteria (see `references/automation-playwright-best-practices.md`).

Use: `assets/templates/test-cases.csv`.

### 3) Implement automation test scripts (Playwright-first)

1. Keep tests readable and aligned with test cases (include test case IDs in titles).
2. Prefer stable locators (e.g., `getByTestId`) over brittle selectors.
3. Avoid arbitrary sleeps; rely on Playwright auto-waits and explicit assertions.
4. Make tests independent (setup preconditions explicitly; avoid order dependencies).
5. Use tagging in test titles (e.g., `@smoke`, `@regression`) so suites are runnable via `--grep`.
6. Capture artifacts for triage (screenshots/video/trace) when debugging failures.

Use: `assets/templates/playwright-spec.ts` and `references/automation-playwright-best-practices.md`.

### 4) Build and maintain regression suites

1. Define suite tiers (example): smoke (critical paths), sanity (build verification), regression (broad), full (release).
2. Select tests using risk + frequency + criticality + defect history (not only coverage).
3. Tag tests consistently and document selection rules and ownership.
4. Review the suite regularly: remove obsolete coverage, add coverage for escaped defects and high-risk changes.

Use: `assets/templates/regression-suite.md` and `references/regression-suite-strategy.md`.

### 5) Create bug reports and document bugs effectively

1. Reproduce reliably; reduce to minimal steps; note variability (frequency) and scope.
2. Capture environment details (build/app version, OS, browser/device, account/role, data conditions).
3. Describe expected vs actual behavior; include impact; set severity and priority consistently.
4. Attach evidence (screenshots, console logs, network traces, Playwright trace) and link related tests/requirements.
5. Track lifecycle: triage notes, owner, fix version, verification steps and results, closure criteria.

Use: `assets/templates/bug-report.md` and `references/bug-report-quality.md`.

### 6) Conduct static testing (reviews)

1. Schedule reviews early (shift-left): requirements, designs, test plans, test cases.
2. Use checklists for consistency (see `references/static-testing.md`).
3. Document findings with severity and actionability.
4. Track defects found in static testing separately (prevention vs detection).

Use: `references/static-testing.md` for review checklists and techniques.

### 7) Estimate test effort

1. Identify factors: scope, complexity, risk, team experience, tool maturity.
2. Apply estimation techniques (see `references/test-estimation.md`):
   - Expert judgment / historical data
   - Test point analysis
   - Work breakdown structure
3. Add contingency for risks and unknowns.
4. Review and refine estimates as the project progresses.

Use: `references/test-estimation.md` for techniques and formulas.

### 8) Monitor test progress and metrics

1. Track execution metrics: planned vs executed vs passed vs failed vs blocked.
2. Monitor defect metrics: found vs fixed vs open, by severity/priority.
3. Calculate test coverage: requirements covered, risk areas tested.
4. Report status regularly and escalate blockers early.

Use: `references/test-monitoring-metrics.md` for metrics definitions and dashboards.

## Quality Gates (self-check)

- **Test plan** includes scope, approach, risks, environments, entry/exit criteria, deliverables, and metrics.
- **Test cases** are traceable, atomic, deterministic, and include clear oracles and data.
- **Automation** is maintainable (stable locators, minimal flake, independent tests, clear assertions).
- **Regression** is risk-based, tagged, and curated with clear add/remove rules.
- **Bug reports** are reproducible, actionable, and contain evidence + environment + impact.
- **Static testing** reviews are documented with findings tracked to resolution.
- **Estimates** include contingency and are refined as scope clarifies.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Test cases lack traceability | Missing requirement IDs | Add `requirement_id` column; link to user stories/ACs |
| Bug reports get rejected | Insufficient reproduction steps | Use minimal steps; include exact data and environment |
| Regression suite too slow | Too many tests, no prioritization | Apply risk-based selection; tier into smoke/sanity/full |
| Flaky automated tests | Unstable locators or timing | Use `data-testid`; avoid sleeps; use Playwright auto-waits |
| Test estimates are wrong | Scope creep, missing risks | Add contingency; re-estimate when scope changes |
| Reviews find no defects | Superficial review | Use checklists; allocate sufficient time; rotate reviewers |
| Unclear test oracles | Missing expected results | Define oracles from requirements, rules, or reference systems |
