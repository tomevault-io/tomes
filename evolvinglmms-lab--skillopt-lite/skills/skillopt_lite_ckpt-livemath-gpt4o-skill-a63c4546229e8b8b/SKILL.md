# Live Mathematical MCQ Heuristics

## The "stronger result" meta-option (check first)
- These questions almost always ask for the *strongest statement that can be proved*. Many include a meta-option worded like "One of the remaining options is correct, but a stronger result can be proven" (or "a stronger result holds", "none of the above is the strongest"). This meta-option can appear under **any** letter (A–E), so identify it by its wording, not its position.
- **Default to this meta-option whenever it is present.** In this benchmark the concrete options are almost always deliberately understated (a missing sharp constant, a missing equality/uniqueness case, a "implies" that is really an "iff", an existence statement that is really existence-and-uniqueness, a bound that is not stated as optimal). Such an understated option means a stronger result *can* be proven, so the meta-option wins.
- **Do not use option E (or the last option) as a proxy for "stronger result."** The meta-option is identified *only* by its literal wording ("a stronger result can be proven", "none of the above is the strongest", etc.). If E is a concrete mathematical statement and no option carries the meta-wording, then there is **no** meta-option present — never pick E just because you feel a stronger result might hold. When no meta-option exists, you must select the single strongest concrete option on its merits.
- Choose a concrete option over the meta-option **only** when you can positively prove that this exact concrete statement is already sharp/maximal and literally nothing about it can be strengthened. The mere fact that a concrete option "looks correct" is not enough — almost all of them are correct but not maximal.
- **Articulation test:** before committing to a concrete option, state in one explicit sentence *why* it cannot be strengthened (e.g. "the constant is proven optimal", "the converse is also false", "uniqueness genuinely fails"). If you cannot give such a concrete, affirmative reason, pick the "stronger result" meta-option instead.
- **Sophisticated wording is not proof of sharpness.** A concrete option that contains "if and only if", "there exists an explicit/effective constant", "unique", or precise-looking quantifiers can still be understated — these are the most common distractors. Do not accept such an option as maximal just because it reads as precise; it still must pass the articulation test, and when it doesn't, choose the meta-option.
- **A detailed, technical-looking option is not automatically the answer.** Questions phrased as "which statement is equivalent to ...", "which gives the complete list/classification", or "what is the strongest statement" often list one precise concrete option that reads as authoritative and complete; in this benchmark that polished option is still usually beaten by the "stronger result" meta-option. Length and technical detail are not evidence of sharpness — run the articulation test before settling on such an option.
- Any time you are unsure, or you cannot rule out a strengthening, pick the "stronger result" meta-option.

## Option Comparison
- Compare all options before committing. The correct choice is often the strongest statement justified by the question, while nearby distractors are weaker, overstrong, or miss an equality case.
- Track exact quantifiers such as "there exists", "for every", "if and only if", and "exactly when".

## Theorem-Level Precision
- Check whether an option weakens the conclusion by dropping a characterization, equality clause, or full equivalence.
- Check whether an option overstates the theorem by upgrading regularity, removing scale restrictions, or changing an existential statement into a universal one.
- **"Stronger" is not the same as "more sweeping."** The provable statement usually keeps a *necessary qualifier*, and the trap option is the one that strips it: a constant that depends on $T$ (not a $T$-uniform/global-in-time bound), a *consistency* result (not an outright impossibility/"no model" claim), a *positive* stable invariant (not its vanishing), a *strict* boundary of a parameter range (not its non-strict closure, e.g. $0<q<1-\theta$ rather than $0<q\le 1-\theta$), or a property attached to the exact object named (not a decorated/restricted variant). When two options differ only by such a qualifier, do **not** upgrade to the unconditional/uniform/extremal cousin unless that upgrade is itself provable; pick the option whose qualifier matches what the hypotheses actually supply.
- **The "appended clause" tell.** When two concrete options read word-for-word the same except that one tacks on an extra clause — a converse ("conversely, every ... occurs"), an upgrade to full equivalence ("all three are equivalent"), an extra bound/constant, or a uniform-in-time/global claim — that appended clause is usually the unprovable trap. Prefer the shorter option without the add-on unless you can positively prove the add-on. (This does not override the literal "stronger result" meta-option, which is chosen by its wording, not by being longer.)

## Hypotheses
- Verify the hypotheses and domain carefully. Distractors often keep the theorem shape but alter the required assumptions.
- Pay close attention to equality cases, extremal conditions, and whether a result applies to the full family or only a restricted subfamily.

## Final Answer
- Reason efficiently: identify the strongest justified statement and commit. Do not attempt to fully re-derive every theorem from scratch — a long exhaustive verification risks running out of time and returning no answer at all. Always reach a decision and output a label.
- **Appended-clause override (run this LAST before output).** Look at your favored option. If it differs from another concrete option *only* by appending one of: a converse ("conversely, every such X actually occurs", "and every X arises in this way"), an upgrade to full equivalence ("all are equivalent"), a uniform-in-$T$ / global-in-time / $T$-independent claim where the shorter option keeps a $T$-dependent constant $C(T)$, an extra bound or sharp constant you have not literally proven, a non-strict closure of a strict inequality, an extra regime added to a binary threshold (e.g. turning "$u<u_C$ vs $u\ge u_C$" into "$u<u_C$ vs $u=u_C$ vs $u>u_C$"), or a sharper integrability/decay exponent (e.g. $\|\cdot\|^{2-\varepsilon}$ in place of $\|\cdot\|^{2}$, or any "for every $\varepsilon>0$" tightening) — switch to the shorter option that lacks the add-on. The appended clause is the trap unless you can state in one sentence the theorem that proves it. This rule overrides any preference for the option that looks "more complete" or "more polished".
- **Clause check before committing.** Restate the option you are about to pick as one sentence, then read it clause by clause. Reject it only if a clause is actually contradicted by the hypotheses — not merely because you have not yet derived that clause. Two options that disagree on a single clause (a quantifier, an equality case, a threshold, a converse) are the real decision; settle that one clause directly rather than defaulting to whichever option reads more cautiously or more impressively.
- **Last check before committing to a concrete option:** if some option literally carries the meta-wording ("a stronger result can be proven", "none of the above is the strongest"), and you have not actually proven via the articulation test that your favored concrete option is sharp/maximal, choose that meta-option instead.
- Output the final answer as the single option label only.
