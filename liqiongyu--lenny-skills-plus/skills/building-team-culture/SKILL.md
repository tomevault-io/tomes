# Building Team Culture

## Scope

**Covers**
- Diagnosing the *current* culture (strengths, gaps, “sacred cows”, and where psychological safety breaks)
- Articulating culture as an **operating system** (principles → behaviors → decision rules)
- Defining **team norms** (communication, meetings, decisions, feedback, conflict)
- Designing a lightweight **rituals/cadence** map that reinforces the culture
- Planning rollout + reinforcement (coaching model, hiring/onboarding hooks, measurement)

**When to use**
- “Create a culture code / values and behaviors for my team.”
- “Our team norms are unclear—write decision-making + communication norms.”
- “Psychological safety is low—propose concrete practices and rituals to fix it.”
- “We’re scaling fast—help us preserve what works and change what doesn’t.”
- “I’m a new leader—help me listen first and then evolve the culture.”

**When NOT to use**
- You need to design team meeting cadence, rituals, or operating systems (use `team-rituals` — this skill defines culture principles and norms, not the specific meeting structure)
- You need engineering-specific practices like code review norms, on-call culture, or incident response culture (use `engineering-culture`)
- You need a full org restructure, reporting lines, or span-of-control redesign (use `organizational-design`)
- You need to improve your 1:1 practice or manager-report relationship (use `running-effective-1-1s`)
- You need an HR/legal investigation, harassment response, or policy/compliance guidance (involve HR/legal)
- You need to design a full org restructure, comp bands, or performance management system
- You need to run user/customer research (use `conducting-user-interviews`) or design a full survey instrument (use `designing-surveys`)

## Inputs

**Minimum required**
- Team context: function, size, seniority mix, reporting line, stage (startup/scale/enterprise)
- Working model: remote/hybrid/in-office; time zones; any planned org changes
- Current symptoms with 2–5 examples (e.g., slow decisions, blame, low ownership, stagnation)
- Desired outcomes: what should be *more true* in 4–12 weeks?
- Constraints: timeline, leadership support, meeting/time budget, “non-negotiables”
- Existing artifacts (if any): values, handbook, onboarding, meeting cadences, principles
- Confidentiality constraints (avoid names/PII; use anonymized examples)

**Missing-info strategy**
- Ask up to 5 questions from [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md) (3–5 at a time).
- If specifics are missing, proceed with a **default** culture OS and clearly label assumptions.
- Do not request secrets or personally identifying details; ask for redacted summaries instead.

## Outputs (deliverables)

Produce a **Team Culture Operating System Pack** in Markdown (in-chat; or as files if requested):

1) **Culture snapshot** (what’s true today; strengths/gaps; root causes; “sacred cows”)
2) **Culture code (v1)** (3–7 principles, each with behaviors, “do/don’t”, decision rules, anti-patterns)
3) **Team norms** (communication, meetings, decisions, feedback, conflict)
4) **Rituals & cadence map** (weekly/monthly/quarterly rituals with purpose + owner)
5) **Rollout + reinforcement plan** (socialization, coaching model, hiring/onboarding hooks)
6) **Measurement plan** (leading indicators + pulse questions)
7) **Risks / Open questions / Next steps** (always)

## Workflow (7 steps)

### 1) Intake + constraints + safety
- **Inputs:** user context; [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md).
- **Actions:** Confirm goals, constraints, and what *must not* change. Identify whether the request includes HR/legal risk; if yes, pause and recommend HR/legal involvement. Clarify what artifacts the user wants (culture code only vs full pack).
- **Outputs:** Context snapshot + assumptions/unknowns list.
- **Checks:** Decision owner and timeline are explicit; sensitive topics are routed appropriately.

### 2) “Listen first”: build a culture snapshot (don’t invent culture yet)
- **Inputs:** current symptoms; existing artifacts; any examples the user can share.
- **Actions:** Summarize what the culture rewards/punishes today. Propose a lightweight “listening tour” plan (questions + who to talk to) if the user hasn’t collected input yet.
- **Outputs:** Draft culture snapshot (strengths, gaps, root causes, tensions, sacred cows).
- **Checks:** Snapshot is evidence-based (examples), not generic; it distinguishes *stated* vs *lived* culture.

### 3) Diagnose the few moves that matter
- **Inputs:** culture snapshot.
- **Actions:** Pick 2–4 priority culture shifts. Identify where “stagnation” exists (lack of visible progress/ambition) and what to change to increase creativity and customer impact. List sacred cows to challenge (and why).
- **Outputs:** Prioritized culture focus areas + success signals.
- **Checks:** Each focus area has a leading indicator (observable behaviors within weeks).

### 4) Articulate culture as an operating system (culture code v1)
- **Inputs:** focus areas; existing values; constraints.
- **Actions:** Write 3–7 principles. For each: definition, behaviors, do/don’t, decision rules, and anti-patterns. Prefer **articulating what already works** and making gaps explicit.
- **Outputs:** Culture code (v1) using [references/TEMPLATES.md](references/TEMPLATES.md).
- **Checks:** Every principle has behavior-level examples; “culture fit” language is replaced with observable standards.

### 5) Turn principles into norms + rituals (make it real)
- **Inputs:** culture code (v1); team operating reality.
- **Actions:** Define explicit norms (communication, meetings, decisions, feedback, conflict). Design rituals that reinforce principles (e.g., weekly customer-impact demo, blameless retro, coaching 1:1s). Assign owners and cadences.
- **Outputs:** Team norms + rituals/cadence map.
- **Checks:** Rituals have a purpose and an owner; norms reduce ambiguity in common failure modes.

### 6) Reinforcement plan (coaching > policing)
- **Inputs:** culture code + norms + rituals.
- **Actions:** Design how the culture will be taught and reinforced: onboarding, hiring signals, promotion expectations, and a lightweight coaching model (peer or craft coaches, not just managers).
- **Outputs:** Rollout + reinforcement plan (with a 30/60/90-day view).
- **Checks:** Reinforcement mechanisms exist beyond “announce the doc”; responsibilities are assigned.

### 7) Quality gate + finalize
- **Inputs:** full draft pack.
- **Actions:** Run [references/CHECKLISTS.md](references/CHECKLISTS.md) and score with [references/RUBRIC.md](references/RUBRIC.md). Add **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**. Recommend the smallest next experiment (1–2 rituals or norms) to validate impact.
- **Outputs:** Final Team Culture Operating System Pack.
- **Checks:** Pack is actionable and internally consistent; tradeoffs and risks are explicit.

## Quality gate (required)
- Use [references/CHECKLISTS.md](references/CHECKLISTS.md) and [references/RUBRIC.md](references/RUBRIC.md).
- Always include: **Risks**, **Open questions**, **Next steps**.

## Examples

**Example 1 (new leader, listen-first):** “I’m a new Head of Product joining a remote team of 14. Culture feels low-trust and decisions are slow. Create a culture snapshot, a culture code, and explicit decision-making + meeting norms. Include a 30/60/90 rollout and measurement plan.”  
Expected: full pack with clear norms and rituals; no generic values.

**Example 2 (scaling + coaching culture):** “We’re growing from 8 → 25. I want to preserve high ownership while adding more coordination. Draft a culture code and a coaching model, plus rituals that keep ambition and creativity high.”  
Expected: principles + behaviors, coaching model, rituals/cadence map.

**Boundary example (HR/legal):** “We have a harassment complaint and need to ‘fix our culture’ immediately.”
Response: direct to HR/legal for investigation and safety; offer to help later with culture articulation, norms, and reinforcement once appropriate.

**Boundary example (redirect to rituals):** “Our meetings are chaotic and we need a better weekly cadence and templates.”
Response: redirect to `team-rituals` — this skill defines culture principles and norms, not the specific meeting structure and operating cadence.

**Boundary example (redirect to engineering):** “We need to improve our code review culture and incident response norms for the engineering team.”
Response: redirect to `engineering-culture` — this skill covers general team culture, not engineering-specific practices.

## Anti-patterns (common failure modes)

1. **Values as wall art** — Writing aspirational values (“innovation”, “integrity”, “excellence”) without defining observable behaviors, decision rules, or anti-patterns. If a principle cannot be used to make a hard trade-off, it is not actionable.
2. **Top-down culture decree** — A leader writes the culture code alone and announces it. Culture articulation should start with listening (what’s already true, what’s not) and involve the team in refinement.
3. **Culture fit as exclusion** — Using “culture fit” to filter out people who are different rather than people who disagree on values. Replace “fit” language with observable behavioral standards that welcome diverse styles.
4. **All principles, no enforcement** — Defining norms but having no reinforcement mechanism (coaching, feedback, hiring signals, promotion criteria). Culture without consequences is suggestion.
5. **Ignoring sacred cows** — Avoiding the hard conversations about entrenched behaviors that contradict stated values. The culture snapshot must explicitly name sacred cows and decide whether to challenge or accept them.
