# Evaluating New Technology

## Scope

**Covers**
- Evaluating a new tool/platform/vendor (including AI products) for adoption
- Emerging tech “should we use this?” decisions
- Build vs buy decisions and tech stack changes
- Running a proof-of-value pilot and capturing evidence
- First-pass risk review (security/privacy/compliance, vendor claims, operational readiness)

**When to use**
- “Evaluate this new AI tool/vendor for our team.”
- “Should we build this in-house or buy a vendor?”
- “We’re considering changing our analytics/experimentation stack—make a recommendation.”
- “Create a technology evaluation doc with a pilot plan, risks, and decision memo.”

**When NOT to use**
- You don’t have a real problem/job to solve yet (use `problem-definition` first).
- You need a full product strategy/roadmap (use `ai-product-strategy`).
- You’re designing how to build an LLM system (use `building-with-llms`).
- You need a formal security assessment / penetration testing (engage security; this skill produces a structured first pass).
- You are weighing trade-offs within an existing design or architecture decision (use `evaluating-trade-offs`).
- You need to manage or pay down existing technical debt rather than adopt something new (use `managing-tech-debt`).
- You already chose the technology and need an implementation/migration plan (use `managing-tech-debt` or `platform-infrastructure`).

## Inputs

**Minimum required**
- Candidate technology (what it is, vendor/build option, links if available)
- Problem/workflow to improve + who it’s for
- Current approach/stack and what’s not working
- Constraints: data sensitivity, privacy/compliance, budget, timeline, regions, deployment model (SaaS/on-prem)
- Decision context: who decides, adoption scope, risk tolerance

**Missing-info strategy**
- Ask up to 5 questions from [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md) (3–5 at a time).
- If still missing, proceed with explicit assumptions and present 2–3 options (e.g., buy vs build vs defer).
- Do not request secrets. If asked to run tools, change production systems, or sign up for vendors, require explicit confirmation.

## Outputs (deliverables)

Produce a **Technology Evaluation Pack** (in chat; or as files if requested), in this order:

1) **Evaluation brief** (problem, stakeholders, decision, constraints, non-goals, assumptions)
2) **Options & criteria matrix** (status quo + alternatives, criteria, scoring, notes)
3) **Build vs buy analysis** (bandwidth/TCO, core competency, opportunity cost, lock-in)
4) **Pilot (proof-of-value) plan** (hypotheses, scope, metrics, timeline, exit criteria)
5) **Risk & guardrails review** (security/privacy/compliance, vendor claims, mitigations)
6) **Decision memo** (recommendation, rationale, trade-offs, adoption/rollback plan)
7) **Risks / Open questions / Next steps** (always included)

Templates: [references/TEMPLATES.md](references/TEMPLATES.md)

## Workflow (8 steps)

### 1) Start with the problem (avoid tool bias)
- **Inputs:** Candidate tech, target workflow/users, current pain.
- **Actions:** Write a one-sentence problem statement and “who feels it.” List 3–5 symptoms and 3–5 non-goals.
- **Outputs:** Draft **Evaluation brief** (problem + non-goals).
- **Checks:** You can explain the decision without naming the tool.

### 2) Define “good” and hard constraints
- **Inputs:** Success metrics, constraints, risk tolerance, decision deadline.
- **Actions:** Define success metrics (leading + lagging) and must-have constraints (privacy, compliance, security, uptime, latency/cost if relevant). Capture “deal breakers.”
- **Outputs:** **Evaluation brief** (success + constraints + deal breakers).
- **Checks:** A stakeholder can say what would make this a clear “yes” or “no.”

### 3) Map options and evaluation criteria (workflows → ROI)
- **Inputs:** Current stack, alternatives, stakeholders.
- **Actions:** List options: status quo, 1–3 vendors, build, hybrid. Define criteria anchored to workflows enabled and ROI (time saved, revenue impact, risk reduction), not feature checklists.
- **Outputs:** **Options & criteria matrix**.
- **Checks:** Every criterion is measurable or at least falsifiable in a pilot.

### 4) Fast reality check: integration + data fit
- **Inputs:** Architecture constraints, data sources, integration points.
- **Actions:** Identify required integrations (SSO, data pipelines, APIs, logs). Note migration complexity, data ownership, and export/exit path. For PLG/growth tools, sanity-check the stack layers (data hub → analytics → lifecycle).
- **Outputs:** Notes added to **Options & criteria matrix** (integration complexity + stack fit).
- **Checks:** You can describe the end-to-end data/control flow in 5–10 bullets.

### 5) Build vs buy with “bandwidth” as a first-class cost
- **Inputs:** Engineering capacity, core competencies, opportunity cost.
- **Actions:** Compare build vs buy using a bandwidth/TCO ledger (build time, maintenance, on-call, upgrades, vendor management). Prefer building only when it’s a core differentiator or the vendor market is immature/unacceptable.
- **Outputs:** **Build vs buy analysis**.
- **Checks:** The analysis includes opportunity cost and who would maintain the system 12 months from now.

### 6) Risk & guardrails review (be skeptical of “100% safe” claims)
- **Inputs:** Data sensitivity, threat model, vendor posture, deployment model.
- **Actions:** Identify key risks (security, privacy, compliance, reliability, lock-in). For AI vendors: treat “guardrails catch everything” claims as marketing; assume determined attackers exist and design defense-in-depth (permissions, logging, human approval points, eval/red-team).
- **Outputs:** **Risk & guardrails review**.
- **Checks:** Each top risk has an owner and a mitigation or a “blocker” label.

### 7) Plan a proof-of-value pilot (or document why you can skip it)
- **Inputs:** Criteria, risks, timeline, stakeholders.
- **Actions:** Define pilot hypotheses, scope, success metrics, test dataset, and evaluation method. Specify timeline, resourcing, and exit criteria (adopt / iterate / reject). Include rollback and data deletion requirements.
- **Outputs:** **Pilot plan**.
- **Checks:** A team can run the pilot without extra meetings; success/failure is unambiguous.

### 8) Decide, communicate, and quality-gate
- **Inputs:** Completed pack drafts.
- **Actions:** Write the **Decision memo** with recommendation, trade-offs, and adoption plan. Run [references/CHECKLISTS.md](references/CHECKLISTS.md) and score with [references/RUBRIC.md](references/RUBRIC.md). Always include **Risks / Open questions / Next steps**.
- **Outputs:** Final **Technology Evaluation Pack**.
- **Checks:** Decision is actionable (owner, date, next actions) and reversible where possible.

## Anti-patterns (common failure modes)

1. **"Shiny object" framing** — Starting from "we should use X" instead of "we need to solve Y." The evaluation becomes a justification exercise rather than a genuine comparison. Always start with the problem statement.
2. **Feature-checklist scoring** — Evaluating options by counting features rather than mapping to workflows and ROI. Result: the tool with the most checkboxes wins even if it solves the wrong problem.
3. **Skipping the status quo option** — Failing to include "do nothing / improve current approach" as a baseline. Result: you cannot prove the new tool is actually better than incremental improvement.
4. **Vendor demo as evidence** — Treating a curated vendor demo as proof of production fitness. Result: the pilot discovers integration, performance, or data-quality issues that the demo hid.
5. **No exit plan** — Adopting a tool without evaluating lock-in, data export, or migration cost. Result: switching cost grows silently until the team is trapped.

## Quality gate (required)
- Use [references/CHECKLISTS.md](references/CHECKLISTS.md) and [references/RUBRIC.md](references/RUBRIC.md).
- Always include: **Risks**, **Open questions**, **Next steps**.

## Examples

**Example 1 (AI vendor):** “Use `evaluating-new-technology` to evaluate an AI ‘prompt guardrails’ vendor for our support agent. Constraints: SOC2 required, PII present, must support SSO, budget $50k/yr, decision in 3 weeks.”  
Expected: evaluation pack that treats guardrail claims skeptically and proposes defense-in-depth + a measurable pilot.

**Example 2 (analytics stack):** “Use `evaluating-new-technology` to choose between PostHog and Amplitude for our PLG product. Current stack: Segment + data warehouse; goal is faster iteration on onboarding and activation.”  
Expected: options matrix + pilot plan tied to workflows (experiments, funnels, lifecycle triggers) and migration effort.

**Boundary example (redirect — no problem defined):** “What’s the best new AI tool we should adopt?”
Response: Out of scope without a problem/workflow. Ask intake questions and/or propose running `problem-definition` first to identify the job-to-be-done before evaluating tools.

**Boundary example (redirect — neighbor skill):** “We already picked Datadog; now help us plan the migration from our current monitoring stack.”
Response: This is a migration/tech-debt execution task, not an evaluation. Redirect to `managing-tech-debt` for a migration plan with milestones, rollback, and decommission steps.
