# Hook & Component Decomposition

Use when breaking apart large files in the Windrose `src/` directory. This skill provides patterns for safely extracting logic from monolithic hooks, components, and the root module.

**Prerequisites:** This skill is **not standalone**. The `datacore-patterns` skill contains critical rules (duplicate `const` crashes, runtime export constraints, `return {}` semantics) that MUST be understood before extracting. Code that looks correct to TypeScript will crash at Datacore runtime if these rules are violated. Read `datacore-patterns` first.

---

## Decision Framework

### When to Extract

Extract when a file has **multiple independent responsibilities** sharing a namespace but not sharing mutable state. Signs:

- Functions that only reference a subset of the file's refs/state
- Blocks of related callbacks that form a logical unit (e.g., "all color picker handlers")
- JSX render sections with clear boundaries and limited data dependencies
- `useEffect` blocks that handle distinct concerns (custom events, resize observers, etc.)

### When NOT to Extract

- **Shared mutable refs between callbacks.** If `handleDragStart` writes to a ref that `handleDragMove` reads on the next frame, they must stay together.
- **Tight state coupling.** If extracting requires passing 10+ parameters back and forth, the abstraction boundary is wrong.
- **Pure math / algorithmic files.** `curveBoolean.ts` (997 lines) is big but cohesive — it's one algorithm. Don't split algorithms.
- **Under 300 lines.** The overhead of a new Datacore module (bootstrap + return {}) isn't worth it for small files.
- **Coordinator/router files.** If the file's primary job is routing events to registered handlers (like `useEventCoordinator.ts`), extraction may not help — the extracted pieces would need all the same dependencies. Ask: "Would the extracted file still need all the same dependencies?" If yes, the file boundary is doing useful aggregation work. Prefer architectural refactors (handler tables, dispatch patterns) over simple extraction for these files.

## Extraction Patterns

### Pattern 1: Extract a Sub-Hook from a Large Hook

**When:** A subset of callbacks + state form a logical group within a mega-hook.

**Steps:**

1. **Map the dependency graph.** For each callback in the group, list:
   - Which `dc.useRef` values it reads/writes
   - Which `dc.useState` values it reads/writes
   - Which other callbacks it calls

2. **Identify the interface.** What does the parent hook need FROM the extracted hook?
   - Return values (state, handlers)
   - What does the extracted hook need as INPUT?
   - Props from parent hook's parameters, shared refs, shared state setters

3. **Check ref sharing.** If two callbacks in different groups share a mutable ref:
   - **Option A:** Move the ref to the parent and pass it down
   - **Option B:** Keep both callbacks in the same file
   - **Option C:** Replace the ref with state (if updates don't need to be synchronous)

4. **Create the new module.** Follow the Datacore pattern:
   ```typescript
   import type { ... } from '#types/...';

   const pathResolverPath = dc.resolvePath("pathResolver.ts");
   const { requireModuleByName } = await dc.require(pathResolverPath) as {
     requireModuleByName: (name: string) => Promise<unknown>
   };

   // Load only what this sub-hook needs
   const { useMapState } = await requireModuleByName("MapContext.tsx") as { ... };

   function useExtractedHook(params: ExtractedHookParams): ExtractedHookResult {
     // State and refs that belong to this concern
     const [localState, setLocalState] = dc.useState(...);
     const localRef = dc.useRef(...);

     // Callbacks for this concern
     const handleThing = dc.useCallback(() => { ... }, []);

     return { localState, handleThing };
   }

   return { useExtractedHook };
   ```

5. **Update the parent hook.** Replace the extracted code with a call:
   ```typescript
   const { useExtractedHook } = await requireModuleByName("useExtractedHook.ts") as { ... };

   function useParentHook(params) {
     // ... remaining state ...
     const { localState, handleThing } = useExtractedHook({ geometry, mapData });
     // ... remaining callbacks that use handleThing ...
     return { ...originalReturn, handleThing };
   }
   ```

**Risks:**
- Hook call order changes. Datacore requires `dc.useEffect` AFTER any `dc.useState` it references. If extraction reorders hooks, the component breaks silently.
- Async loading. The extracted hook is loaded via `requireModuleByName` at module init time, not at render time. This is fine as long as there are no circular dependencies.

### Pattern 2: Extract JSX Sections into Sub-Components

**When:** A component's render function has distinct visual sections with clear prop boundaries.

**Steps:**

1. **Identify the section.** Look for blocks of JSX wrapped in conditionals or logical groups (modals, toolbars, overlays, indicators).

2. **List what it reads.** Trace every variable the JSX block references:
   - Props from parent
   - State from hooks
   - Callbacks it invokes

3. **Define a clean props interface:**
   ```typescript
   interface CardinalIndicatorsProps {
     edgeSnapMode: boolean;
     positions: CardinalIndicatorPositions;
     selectedObject: MapObject | null;
   }
   ```

4. **Create the component file (.tsx):**
   ```typescript
   import type { ... } from '#types/...';

   const pathResolverPath = dc.resolvePath("pathResolver.ts");
   const { requireModuleByName } = await dc.require(pathResolverPath) as { ... };

   interface CardinalIndicatorsProps { ... }

   const CardinalIndicators = ({ edgeSnapMode, positions, selectedObject }: CardinalIndicatorsProps) => {
     if (!edgeSnapMode || !selectedObject) return null;
     return (
       <div class="cardinal-indicators">
         {/* extracted JSX */}
       </div>
     );
   };

   return { CardinalIndicators };
   ```

5. **Replace in parent with a component load + usage:**
   ```typescript
   const { CardinalIndicators } = await requireModuleByName("CardinalIndicators.tsx") as { ... };
   // In JSX:
   <CardinalIndicators edgeSnapMode={edgeSnapMode} positions={positions} selectedObject={obj} />
   ```

**Good extraction candidates** (pure JSX, minimal logic):
- Tooltip overlays
- Indicator graphics (cardinal snaps, alignment guides)
- Modal wrappers (already have clear open/close state)

**Bad extraction candidates:**
- JSX that tightly interacts with imperative canvas code
- Sections that read 8+ state variables from the parent (the props interface would be worse than the inline code)

---

### Pattern 3: Extract State Groups from the Root Component

**When:** The root component (`DungeonMapTracker.tsx`) manages state for unrelated UI concerns.

**Steps:**

1. **Group related state.** Find useState calls that are always read/written together:
   - UI visibility: `showFooter, isExpanded, showLayerPanel, showRegionPanel, showVisibilityToolbar`
   - Image alignment: `isAlignmentMode, alignmentOffsetX, alignmentOffsetY, returningFromAlignment`
   - Panel modals: `showSettingsModal, showPluginInstaller, editingLayerId`

2. **Extract each group into a custom hook:**
   ```typescript
   function useUILayout() {
     const [showFooter, setShowFooter] = dc.useState(true);
     const [isExpanded, setIsExpanded] = dc.useState(false);
     const [showLayerPanel, setShowLayerPanel] = dc.useState(false);
     // ...
     return { showFooter, setShowFooter, isExpanded, toggleExpand, ... };
   }
   ```

3. **Keep the root component as a composition shell.** It should:
   - Call hooks
   - Wire props between children
   - Render the component tree
   - NOT contain business logic

---

### Pattern 4: Extract useEffect Blocks

**When:** A component has multiple `useEffect` blocks handling unrelated side effects.

**Steps:**

1. **Identify independent effects.** An effect is independent if:
   - Its dependency array has no overlap with other effects' deps
   - Its cleanup doesn't affect other effects
   - It handles a distinct concern (custom event, resize, keyboard shortcut)

2. **Move to a custom hook:**
   ```typescript
   function useCustomEventHandler(eventName: string, handler: (e: CustomEvent) => void) {
     const handlerRef = dc.useRef(handler);
     handlerRef.current = handler;

     dc.useEffect(() => {
       const listener = (e: Event) => handlerRef.current(e as CustomEvent);
       document.addEventListener(eventName, listener);
       return () => document.removeEventListener(eventName, listener);
     }, [eventName]);
   }
   ```

3. **Replace in parent:**
   ```typescript
   useCustomEventHandler('windrose:enter-sub-hex', (e) => {
     enterSubHex(e.detail.q, e.detail.r);
   });
   ```

**Key rule:** Use a ref for the handler callback so the effect never re-runs when the handler changes (see react-performance skill, section 2.4).

---

### Pattern 5: Routing Table Refactor (for coordinator files)

**When:** A file has large `switch(currentTool)` blocks repeated across multiple event handlers (e.g., `handlePointerDown`, `handlePointerMove`, `handlePointerUp` each switching on the same tool enum).

**This is NOT an extraction — it's an architectural refactor.** You are replacing imperative routing with a declarative handler map.

**Steps:**

1. **Define the handler interface:**
   ```typescript
   interface ToolEventHandlers {
     onPointerDown?: (e: PointerEvent, context: ToolContext) => void;
     onPointerMove?: (e: PointerEvent, context: ToolContext) => void;
     onPointerUp?: (e: PointerEvent, context: ToolContext) => void;
   }

   interface ToolContext {
     geometry: IGeometry;
     canvasRef: { current: HTMLCanvasElement | null };
     // ... shared deps the handlers need
   }
   ```

2. **Build the handler map:**
   ```typescript
   const toolHandlers: Record<ToolType, ToolEventHandlers> = {
     select: { onPointerDown: handleSelectDown, onPointerMove: handleSelectMove, ... },
     draw: { onPointerDown: handleDrawDown, onPointerMove: handleDrawMove, ... },
     // ...
   };
   ```

3. **Replace the switch-case with dispatch:**
   ```typescript
   const handlePointerDown = dc.useCallback((e: PointerEvent) => {
     const handler = toolHandlers[currentTool];
     handler?.onPointerDown?.(e, toolContext);
   }, [currentTool, toolContext]);
   ```

4. **Each tool's handlers can live in separate files** loaded via `requireModuleByName`, keeping the coordinator as a thin dispatch shell.

**Risks:** This is a large refactor. The handler map interface must accommodate all tool-specific state needs via `ToolContext`. Do not attempt this without full test coverage of all tools.

## Extraction Checklist

Before submitting a decomposition PR:

- [ ] **No circular dependencies.** New module doesn't `requireModuleByName` a module that loads it.
- [ ] **Unique filename.** No other file in the project has the same name.
- [ ] **Hook order preserved.** All `dc.useState` calls happen before `dc.useEffect` calls that reference their state.
- [ ] **return {} at end.** Every new file ends with `return { ... }` (not `export`).
- [ ] **requireModuleByName bootstrap.** Every new file starts with the pathResolver dance.
- [ ] **Types via import type.** All cross-module type references use `import type` from `#types/`.
- [ ] **No prop explosion.** Extracted hooks/components take < 8 parameters. If more, the boundary is wrong.
- [ ] **No duplicate `const` names.** After extraction, grep the parent for any name that both the parent and extracted module destructure. Duplicate names in the same Datacore scope cause a `SyntaxError` in `new Function()` — TypeScript will NOT catch this. This is the most common post-extraction bug.
- [ ] **Listener registration co-located with cleanup.** If extracting a handler that was registered in the parent's `useEffect`, either move the `addEventListener` into the extracted hook OR explicitly note in the parent that cleanup responsibility stays there. Split registration/cleanup across files is a leak waiting to happen.
- [ ] **Tests still pass.** Run `npm run test:unit` at minimum; `npm run test:e2e` if touching interactions.
- [ ] **Net reduction.** The parent file got meaningfully smaller AND the new file is cohesive (not a grab-bag).

## Windrose-Specific Extraction Targets

Ranked by safety and impact. These are the recommended first moves:

### Tier 1: Safe Extractions (low coupling, clear boundaries)

| Source File | Extract To | What | ~Lines Moved |
|------------|-----------|------|-------------|
| `DungeonMapTracker.tsx` | `useUILayout.ts` | UI visibility toggles (7 states) | ~80 |
| `DungeonMapTracker.tsx` | `useCustomEventHandlers.ts` | 4 custom event useEffect blocks | ~250 |
| `ObjectLayer.tsx` | `CardinalIndicators.tsx` | Snap direction indicators (pure JSX) | ~90 |
| `ObjectLayer.tsx` | `ObjectTooltip.tsx` | Hover tooltip rendering (pure JSX) | ~30 |

### Tier 2: Moderate Extractions (some shared state, well-defined interfaces)

| Source File | Extract To | What | ~Lines Moved |
|------------|-----------|------|-------------|
| `useObjectInteractions.ts` | `useObjectUIPositions.ts` | 4 `calculate*ButtonPosition` callbacks | ~120 |
| `useObjectInteractions.ts` | `useObjectModifications.ts` | Color, rotation, deletion, duplication handlers | ~150 |
| `ObjectLayer.tsx` | `useObjectModals.ts` | Modal state + open/close/submit handlers | ~150 |
| `useEventCoordinator.ts` | `useTouchGestures.ts` | Long-press timer, double-tap detection | ~80 |

### Tier 3: Careful Extractions (shared mutable refs, complex interfaces)

| Source File | Extract To | What | Risk |
|------------|-----------|------|------|
| `useObjectInteractions.ts` | `useDragResize.ts` | Drag + resize logic | Shared `dragInitialStateRef`, `edgeSnapMode` |
| `useEventCoordinator.ts` | Routing table refactor (Pattern 5) | Replace 3x `switch(currentTool)` blocks in pointer handlers with a `ToolEventHandlers` map | High — affects all tool interactions. Requires full E2E test coverage first. See Pattern 5 above. |
| `DungeonMapTracker.tsx` | Extract settings/theme | Computed settings + theme memoization | Many children depend on it |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Extracting too early.** Read the full file before deciding boundaries. The obvious split isn't always the right one.
2. **Moving refs across module boundaries.** A ref created in hook A and read in hook B via parameter works, but it's fragile — the parent must wire them correctly.
3. **Breaking the hook call count.** If the parent called 5 `dc.useState` and 3 `dc.useEffect`, and after extraction it calls 3 `dc.useState` + `useExtracted()` (which has 2 `dc.useState` + 3 `dc.useEffect`), the total hook count changed from the component's perspective. This is fine in React/Preact, but verify the call is unconditional (not inside an if).
4. **Over-typing the extraction interface.** If you find yourself writing a 50-line TypeScript interface just to pass data between parent and child hook, reconsider the boundary.
5. **Forgetting cleanup.** If the extracted hook registers event listeners, it MUST return cleanup. Verify the parent doesn't also try to clean up the same listeners.
