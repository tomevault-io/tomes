# Git Commit Best Practices (limps)

## Purpose
Guide the creation of clear, meaningful Git commits that follow conventional commit standards and repository-specific conventions. Ensures commits are atomic, well-documented, and integrate with automated tooling (release-please, changelog generation).

## Scope
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is "review-commits" or a commit range (e.g., `HEAD~5..HEAD`, `main..HEAD`), review existing commits and suggest improvements.
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is a scope (paths or component), provide commit guidance for those changes.
- If no arguments provided, guide commit message creation for staged changes.

## Detecting Breaking Changes

When reviewing commits, detect breaking changes by:
1. **Parse commit messages**: `git log --format="%H%n%s%n%b" <range>` (includes full body)
2. **Search for footer**: Look for `BREAKING CHANGE:` or `BREAKING CHANGE` in commit body (case-insensitive)
3. **Extract description**: Everything after `BREAKING CHANGE:` until:
   - Next footer (e.g., `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`)
   - End of commit message
   - Empty line followed by non-footer text
4. **Example commands**:
   - Simple: `git log --format=%B main..HEAD | grep -A 10 -i "BREAKING CHANGE"`
   - More robust: `git log --format="%H%n%s%n%b%n---" <range>` then parse each commit separately
5. **Edge cases**:
   - Multi-line breaking changes: Extract until next footer or end
   - Breaking change in subject: Look for `!` after type/scope: `feat!: breaking change`
   - Merge commits: Check merge commit message for breaking changes

## Conventional Commit Format

### Structure
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature (triggers minor version bump)
- `fix`: Bug fix (triggers patch version bump)
- `docs`: Documentation changes only
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, whitespace, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (no feature change or bug fix)
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (deps, config, build)
- `ci`: CI/CD changes
- `build`: Build system changes
- `revert`: Revert a previous commit

### Scope (Optional but Recommended)
- **Single scope** (most common): Package name (`limps`, `limps-headless`) or component (`cli`, `server`, `tools`, `resources`, `rlm`, `indexer`)
- **Multiple scopes**: Use comma-separated for cross-package changes: `feat(limps,limps-headless): ...`
- **When to use multiple**: Only when change affects multiple packages/components in same commit
- **Area scopes**: `config`, `mcp`, `extensions`, `watcher` (use when change is area-specific, not package-specific)

### Subject Line Rules
- **Imperative mood**: "add feature" not "added feature" or "adds feature"
- **Lowercase** (except proper nouns, acronyms)
- **No period** at the end
- **50 characters or less** (ideally)
- **Clear and specific**: Describe what the commit does, not why (why goes in body)

### Body (Optional but Recommended for Complex Changes)
- **Separated by blank line** from subject
- **72 characters per line** (wrap if needed)
- Explain **what** and **why** (not how - code shows how)
- Reference related issues, plans, or agents
- Note breaking changes if applicable

### Footer (Optional)
- **Breaking changes**: `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>`
- **Issue references**: `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`, `Related to #789`
- **Plan/Agent references**: `Plan: NNNN-plan-name`, `Agent: 008`

## Examples

### Simple Feature
```
feat(limps): add config migration utility

Adds utility to migrate config files between versions, handling
backward compatibility and preserving user settings.

Related to plan NNNN-plan-name
```

### Bug Fix with Issue Reference
```
fix(server): handle missing config gracefully

Previously, missing config files would crash the server. Now
returns helpful error message and exits cleanly.

Fixes #42
```

### Breaking Change
```
refactor(config): restructure config schema

BREAKING CHANGE: Config file format changed from JSON to YAML.
Existing configs must be migrated using `limps config migrate`.

Migration guide: docs/config-migration.md
```

### Multi-Package Change
```
feat(limps,limps-headless): add extension system

Adds extension loader and context system to both packages.
Extensions can register custom tools and resources.

Plan: NNNN-plan-name
Agent: 007
```

### Documentation Only
```
docs: update CLAUDE.md with extension system details

Adds documentation for extension development and integration.
```

## Atomic Commits

### Principles
- **One logical change per commit**: Each commit should represent a complete, working change
- **Buildable and testable**: Each commit should leave the repo in a valid state
- **Reviewable**: Changes should be grouped logically for code review

### When to Split Commits
- Different types of changes (e.g., refactor + feature)
- Unrelated files or subsystems
- Formatting/style changes separate from logic changes
- Test changes separate from implementation

### When to Combine Commits
- Related changes that depend on each other
- Small, related fixes in the same file
- Documentation updates that accompany code changes

## Repository-Specific Guidelines

### Monorepo Considerations
- **Specify package scope** when changes are package-specific: `feat(limps): ...`
- **Use root-level scope** for cross-package changes: `feat: ...` or `feat(limps,limps-headless): ...`
- **Workspace-aware**: Consider impact on other packages

### Plan/Agent Integration
- **Reference plans/agents** in commit body when applicable:
  - `Plan: NNNN-plan-name`
  - `Agent: 008-complex-parsing`
- **Use agent titles** in subject when committing agent work:
  - `feat(limps-headless): implement complex parsing logic`
  - Body: `Agent: 008-complex-parsing`

### Release-Please Integration
- **Type matters**: `feat` → minor bump, `fix` → patch bump
- **Breaking changes**: Use `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer for major bumps
- **Scope helps**: Package-scoped commits help release-please target correct package

### Changelog Generation
- Commits with conventional format automatically appear in CHANGELOG.md
- Body content may be included in changelog entries
- Reference issues/PRs for better changelog links

## Workflow

### Before Committing
1. **Review staged changes**: `git diff --cached`
2. **Check for unrelated changes**: Split if needed
3. **Verify tests pass**: `npm test` (or workspace-specific: `npm test --workspace <name>`)
4. **Check formatting**: `npm run format:check` (repo-specific command)
   - **Note**: These commands are limps-specific; adapt for other repos

### Creating the Commit
1. **Determine type**: What kind of change is this?
2. **Identify scope**: Which package/component?
3. **Write subject**: Clear, imperative, concise
4. **Add body** (if needed): Explain context, why, related items
5. **Add footer** (if needed): Issues, breaking changes, plans

### After Committing
1. **Review commit**: `git log -1` to verify format
2. **Amend if needed**: `git commit --amend` (before pushing)

## Reviewing Commits

When reviewing commits (e.g., `review-commits` argument or commit range):

1. **Parse commits**: `git log --format="%H%n%s%n%b%n---" <range>` to get full commit messages
2. **Check format**: Does it follow conventional commits? (`<type>(<scope>): <subject>`)
3. **Evaluate atomicity**: Should this be split or combined?
4. **Assess clarity**: Is the message clear and informative?
5. **Verify completeness**: Does it reference related issues/plans?
6. **Check breaking changes**: Look for `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer or `!` in type
7. **Suggest improvements**: Provide specific recommendations with examples

### Review Output Format

When reviewing commits, use this structure:

```
## Commit Review: <commit-range>

### Summary
- Total commits: X
- Format compliance: Y compliant, Z need improvement
- Breaking changes: Found in commits [list]

### Findings by Commit

#### Commit <hash>: <subject>
- ✅ Format: Conventional commit format
- ⚠️ Issues: [if any]
- 🔴 Critical: [if any]
- Suggestions: [specific improvements]

### Overall Recommendations
- [Action items]
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too vague**: `fix: update code`
✅ **Specific**: `fix(server): handle undefined config paths`

❌ **Past tense**: `feat: added new feature`
✅ **Imperative**: `feat: add new feature`

❌ **Too long subject**: `feat(limps): implement comprehensive configuration management system with validation and migration support`
✅ **Concise**: `feat(limps): add config validation and migration`

❌ **Multiple unrelated changes**: One commit with formatting + feature + test
✅ **Separate commits**: One for formatting, one for feature, one for test

❌ **Missing context**: `fix: bug fix`
✅ **With context**: `fix(indexer): prevent SQL injection in search queries`

## Output Format

When providing commit guidance:

```
## Suggested Commit Message

<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

## Rationale
- Why this type/scope
- What makes it atomic
- Related items (issues, plans, agents)

## Checklist
- [ ] Subject is imperative and clear
- [ ] Scope is appropriate
- [ ] Body explains context (if needed)
- [ ] Footer references issues/plans (if applicable)
- [ ] Commit is atomic
- [ ] Tests pass
```

## Notes

- Prefer `git commit` with message over `-m` for complex commits (opens editor)
- Use `git commit --amend` to fix commit messages before pushing
- Use `git rebase -i` to clean up commit history (before pushing)
- Conventional commits enable automated tooling (release-please, changelog)
- Clear commits make code review and debugging easier
- **Merge commits**: Review merge commit messages; they should describe what's being merged
- **Squash commits**: When squashing, combine commit messages meaningfully
- **Revert commits**: Use `revert: <original-subject>` format: `revert: feat(limps): add feature`
