# Execute Tasks Skill

This skill orchestrates autonomous task execution for Claude Code Tasks. It builds a dependency-aware execution plan, launches a dedicated agent for each task through a 4-phase workflow (Understand, Implement, Verify, Complete), handles retries with failure context, and shares learnings across tasks through a shared execution context file.

## Core Principles

### 1. Understand Before Implementing

Never write code without first understanding:
- What the task requires (acceptance criteria or inferred requirements)
- What code already exists (read before modify)
- What conventions the project follows (CLAUDE.md, existing patterns)
- What earlier tasks discovered (shared execution context)

### 2. Follow Existing Patterns

Match the codebase's established patterns:
- Coding style, naming conventions, file organization
- Error handling approach, logging patterns
- Test framework, test structure, assertion style
- Import ordering, module organization

### 3. Verify Against Criteria

Do not assume implementation is correct. Verify by:
- Walking through each acceptance criterion for spec-generated tasks
- Running tests and linters for all tasks
- Confirming the core change works as intended
- Checking for regressions in existing functionality

### 4. Report Honestly

Produce accurate verification results:
- PASS only when all Functional criteria pass and tests pass
- PARTIAL when non-critical criteria fail but core works
- FAIL when Functional criteria or tests fail
- Never mark a task complete if verification fails

## Orchestration Workflow

This skill orchestrates task execution through a 10-step loop. See `references/orchestration.md` for the full detailed procedure.

### Step 1: Load Task List
Retrieve all tasks via `TaskList`. If a `--task-group` argument was provided, filter tasks to only those with matching `metadata.task_group`. If a specific `task-id` argument was provided, validate it exists.

### Step 2: Validate State
Handle edge cases: empty list, all completed, specific task blocked, no unblocked tasks, circular dependencies.

### Step 3: Build Execution Plan
Resolve `max_parallel` setting using precedence: `--max-parallel` CLI arg > `.claude/agent-alchemy.local.md` setting > default 5. Build a dependency graph from pending tasks. Assign tasks to waves using topological levels: Wave 1 = no dependencies, Wave 2 = depends on Wave 1 tasks, etc. Sort within waves by priority (critical > high > medium > low > unprioritized), break ties by "unblocks most others." Cap each wave at `max_parallel` tasks.

### Step 4: Check Settings
Read `.claude/agent-alchemy.local.md` if it exists for execution preferences, including `max_parallel` setting. CLI `--max-parallel` argument takes precedence over the settings file value.

### Step 5: Initialize Execution Directory
Generate a `task_execution_id` using three-tier resolution: (1) if `--task-group` provided → `{task_group}-{YYYYMMDD}-{HHMMSS}`, (2) else if all open tasks share the same `metadata.task_group` → `{task_group}-{YYYYMMDD}-{HHMMSS}`, (3) else → `exec-session-{YYYYMMDD}-{HHMMSS}`. Clean any stale `__live_session__/` files by archiving them to `.claude/sessions/interrupted-{YYYYMMDD}-{HHMMSS}/`, resetting any `in_progress` tasks from the interrupted session back to `pending`. Check for and enforce the concurrency guard via `.lock` file. Create `.claude/sessions/__live_session__/` directory containing:
- `execution_plan.md` — saved execution plan from Step 5
- `execution_context.md` — initialized with standard template
- `task_log.md` — initialized with table headers (Task ID, Subject, Status, Attempts, Duration, Token Usage)
- `tasks/` — subdirectory for archiving completed task files
- `progress.md` — initialized with status template for real-time progress tracking
- `execution_pointer.md` at `~/.claude/tasks/{CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID}/` — created immediately with absolute path to `.claude/sessions/__live_session__/`

### Step 6: Present Execution Plan and Confirm
Display the plan showing tasks to execute, blocked tasks, and completed count. Also display the details of step 5 which includes the session directory path (`.claude/sessions/__live_session__/`) and files created, including the execution pointer file location.

Then ask the user to confirm before proceeding with execution. If the user cancels, stop without modifying any tasks.

### Step 7: Initialize Execution Context
Read `.claude/sessions/__live_session__/execution_context.md` (created in Step 5). If a prior execution context exists, look in `.claude/sessions/` for the most recent timestamped subfolder and merge relevant learnings into the new one.

### Step 8: Execute Loop
Execute tasks in waves. For each wave: snapshot `execution_context.md`, mark wave tasks `in_progress`, update `progress.md` with all active tasks, launch up to `max_parallel` background agents simultaneously via **parallel Task tool calls with `run_in_background: true`**, recording the `{task_list_id → background_task_id}` mapping from each Task tool response. Each agent writes to `context-task-{id}.md` and a compact `result-task-{id}.md` (completion signal). The orchestrator polls for result files via the `poll-for-results.sh` script in a single Bash invocation (with `timeout: 2760000`), then batch-reads results to process outcomes — avoiding full agent output in context. After polling, the orchestrator calls `TaskOutput` on each background task_id to reap the process and extract per-task `duration_ms` and `total_tokens` usage metadata for the task log. If `TaskOutput` times out (agent stuck), `TaskStop` is called to force-terminate the agent. Failed tasks with retries remaining are re-launched as background agents (same TaskOutput reaping after retry polling). After all wave agents complete: merge per-task context files into `execution_context.md`, clean up result and context files, archive completed task JSONs, refresh TaskList for newly unblocked tasks, form next wave, repeat.

### Step 9: Session Summary
Display execution results with pass/fail counts, total execution time (sum of per-task `duration_ms`), failed task list, newly unblocked tasks, and total token usage (sum of per-task `total_tokens` captured via `TaskOutput`). Save `session_summary.md` to `.claude/sessions/__live_session__/`. Archive the session by moving all contents from `__live_session__/` to `.claude/sessions/{task_execution_id}/`, leaving `__live_session__/` as an empty directory. `execution_pointer.md` stays pointing to `__live_session__/`.

### Step 10: Update CLAUDE.md
Review execution context for project-wide changes (new patterns, dependencies, commands, structure changes, design decisions). Make targeted edits to CLAUDE.md if meaningful changes occurred. Skip if only task-specific or internal implementation details.

## Task Classification

Determine whether a task is spec-generated or general to select the right verification approach.

### Detection Algorithm

1. **Check description format**: Look for `**Acceptance Criteria:**` with categorized criteria (`_Functional:_`, `_Edge Cases:_`, etc.)
2. **Check metadata**: Look for `metadata.spec_path` field
3. **Check source reference**: Look for `Source: {path} Section {number}` in the description

If any check matches -> **spec-generated task** (use criterion-based verification)

If none match -> **General task** (use inferred verification)

## 4-Phase Workflow

Each task is executed by the `agent-alchemy-sdd:task-executor` agent through these phases:

### Phase 1: Understand

Load context and understand scope before writing code.

- Read the execute-tasks skill and references
- Read `.claude/sessions/__live_session__/execution_context.md` for learnings from prior tasks
- Load task details via `TaskGet`
- Classify the task (spec-generated vs general)
- Parse acceptance criteria or infer requirements from description
- Explore affected files via Glob/Grep
- Read `CLAUDE.md` for project conventions

### Phase 2: Implement

Execute the code changes following project patterns.

- Read all target files before modifying them
- Follow the project's implementation order (data -> service -> interface -> tests)
- Match existing coding patterns and conventions
- Write tests if specified in testing requirements
- Run mid-implementation checks (linter, existing tests) to catch issues early

### Phase 3: Verify

Verify implementation against task requirements using the adaptive approach.

- **spec-generated tasks**: Walk each acceptance criteria category (Functional, Edge Cases, Error Handling, Performance), check testing requirements, run tests
- **General tasks**: Infer "done" from description, run existing tests, run linter, verify core change is implemented

### Phase 4: Complete

Report results and share learnings.

- Determine status (PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL) based on verification results
- If PASS: mark task as `completed` via `TaskUpdate`
- If PARTIAL or FAIL: leave as `in_progress` for the orchestrator to decide on retry
- Write learnings to `.claude/sessions/__live_session__/context-task-{id}.md` (files discovered, patterns learned, issues encountered)
- Write compact result to `.claude/sessions/__live_session__/result-task-{id}.md` (status, verification summary, files modified, issues) — this is the **last** file written and signals completion to the orchestrator
- Return minimal status line: `DONE: [{id}] {subject} - {PASS|PARTIAL|FAIL}`

## Adaptive Verification Overview

Verification adapts based on task type:

| Task Type | Verification Method | Pass Threshold |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| spec-generated | Criterion-by-criterion evaluation | All Functional + Tests must pass |
| General | Inferred checklist from description | Core change works + Tests pass |

**Critical rule**: All Functional criteria must pass for a PASS result. Edge Cases, Error Handling, and Performance failures result in PARTIAL but do not block completion.

## Shared Execution Context

Tasks within an execution session share learnings through `.claude/sessions/__live_session__/execution_context.md`:

- **Write-based updates**: All orchestrator writes to session artifacts (`execution_context.md`, `task_log.md`, `progress.md`) use Write (full file replacement) via a read-modify-write pattern, never Edit. This ensures atomic, reliable updates regardless of file size.
- **Snapshot before wave**: The orchestrator snapshots `execution_context.md` before launching each wave — all agents in a wave read the same baseline
- **Per-task writes**: Each agent writes to `context-task-{id}.md` instead of the shared file, regardless of `max_parallel` setting. This eliminates write contention and avoids fragile Edit operations on shared files.
- **Result file protocol**: Each agent writes a compact `result-task-{id}.md` (~18 lines) as its very last action. The orchestrator polls for these files and reads them instead of consuming full agent output, reducing context consumption by ~79% per wave.
- **Merge after wave**: After all agents in a wave complete, the orchestrator appends all `context-task-{id}.md` content to the `## Task History` section of `execution_context.md` and deletes the per-task files. Result files for PASS tasks are also deleted; FAIL result files are retained for post-analysis.
- **Sections**: Project Patterns, Key Decisions, Known Issues, File Map, Task History

This enables later tasks to benefit from earlier discoveries and retry attempts to learn from previous failures.

## Key Behaviors

- **Autonomous execution loop**: After the user confirms the execution plan, no further prompts occur between tasks. The loop runs without interruption once started.
- **Background agent execution**: Agents run as background tasks (`run_in_background: true`), returning ~3 lines (task_id + output_file) instead of ~100+ lines of full output. This reduces orchestrator context consumption by ~79% per wave.
- **Agent process reaping**: After polling confirms result files exist, the orchestrator calls `TaskOutput` on each background task_id to reap the process and extract per-task `duration_ms` and `total_tokens` usage metadata. If `TaskOutput` times out, `TaskStop` force-terminates the stuck agent. This prevents lingering background processes.
- **Result file protocol**: Each agent writes a compact `result-task-{id}.md` (~18 lines) as its very last action. The orchestrator polls for these files via `poll-for-results.sh` in a single Bash invocation (with `timeout: 2760000`), then batch-reads them for processing. The result file doubles as a completion signal.
- **Batched session file updates**: Instead of per-task read-modify-write on `task_log.md` and `progress.md`, all updates are batched into a single read-modify-write cycle per file per wave.
- **Wave-based parallelism**: Tasks at the same dependency level run simultaneously, up to `max_parallel` concurrent agents per wave. Tasks in later waves wait until their dependencies in earlier waves complete.
- **One agent per task, multiple per wave**: Each task gets a fresh agent invocation with isolated context, but multiple agents run concurrently within a wave.
- **Per-task context isolation**: Each agent writes to `context-task-{id}.md` regardless of `max_parallel` setting. The orchestrator merges these after each wave. This eliminates write contention and fragile Edit operations on shared files.
- **Within-wave retry**: Failed tasks with retries remaining are re-launched as background agents. The orchestrator polls for retry result files using `poll-for-results.sh` (same pattern as initial wave polling).
- **Configurable parallelism**: Default 5 concurrent tasks, configurable via `--max-parallel` argument or `.claude/agent-alchemy.local.md` settings. Set to 1 for sequential execution.
- **Configurable retries**: Default 3 attempts per task, configurable via `retries` argument.
- **Retry with context**: Each retry includes failure details from the previous attempt's result file so the agent can try a different approach.
- **Dynamic unblocking**: After each wave completes, the dependency graph is refreshed and newly unblocked tasks are added to the next wave.
- **Honest failure handling**: After retries exhausted, tasks stay `in_progress` (not completed), and execution continues.
- **Circular dependency detection**: If all remaining tasks are blocked by each other, break at the weakest link (task with fewest blockers) and log a warning.
- **Shared context**: Agents read the snapshot of `execution_context.md` and write learnings to per-task context files. The orchestrator appends per-task content to the Task History section between waves.
- **Resilient context sharing**: If a task-executor fails to write its context or result file, the orchestrator falls back to `TaskOutput` to capture diagnostic output.
- **Single-session invariant**: Only one execution session can run at a time per project. A `.lock` file in `__live_session__/` prevents concurrent invocations.
- **Interrupted session recovery**: Stale sessions are detected and archived; tasks left `in_progress` are automatically reset to `pending`.
