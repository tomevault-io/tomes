# Code Reviewer

This skill guides the agent in conducting professional and thorough code reviews
for both local development and remote Pull Requests.

## Workflow

### 1. Determine Review Target

- **Remote PR**: If the user provides a PR number or URL (e.g., "Review PR
  #123"), target that remote PR.
- **Local Changes**: If no specific PR is mentioned, or if the user asks to
  "review my changes", target the current local file system states (staged and
  unstaged changes).

### 2. Preparation

#### For Remote PRs:

1.  **Checkout**: Use the GitHub CLI to checkout the PR.
    ```bash
    gh pr checkout <PR_NUMBER>
    ```
2.  **Verification**: Execute the workspace's verification suite to catch issues
    early. Capture the output of these commands to inform your review (e.g.,
    note any failed tests or linting errors).
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run build
    npm run test
    npm run lint
    npm run format:check
    ```
3.  **Context**: Read the PR description and any existing comments to understand
    the goal and history.

#### For Local Changes:

1.  **Identify Changes**:
    - Check status: `git status`
    - Read diffs: `git diff` (working tree) and/or `git diff --staged` (staged).
2.  **Verification**: Ask the user if they want to run the verification suite
    before reviewing. If yes, run the same commands as for remote PRs.

### 3. In-Depth Analysis

Analyze the code changes based on the following pillars:

- **Correctness**: Does the code achieve its stated purpose without bugs or
  logical errors?
- **Maintainability**: Is the code clean, well-structured, and easy to
  understand and modify in the future? Consider factors like code clarity,
  modularity, and adherence to established design patterns.
- **Readability**: Is the code well-commented (where necessary) and consistently
  formatted according to our project's coding style guidelines?
- **Efficiency**: Are there any obvious performance bottlenecks or resource
  inefficiencies introduced by the changes?
- **Security**: Are there any potential security vulnerabilities or insecure
  coding practices?
- **Edge Cases and Error Handling**: Does the code appropriately handle edge
  cases and potential errors?
- **Testability**: Is the new or modified code adequately covered by tests (even
  if preflight checks pass)? Suggest additional test cases that would improve
  coverage or robustness.

### 4. Draft Feedback (DO NOT FIX)

**IMPORTANT**: You are a reviewer, NOT a fixer. Do NOT attempt to fix the code
yourself. Your goal is to provide high-quality feedback.

#### Structure

- **Summary**: A high-level overview of the review.
- **Verification Results**: briefly summarize the results of the build, test,
  lint, and format checks.
- **Findings**:
  - **Critical**: Bugs, security issues, test failures, lint errors, or breaking
    changes.
  - **Improvements**: Suggestions for better code quality or performance.
  - **Nitpicks**: Formatting or minor style issues (optional).
- **Conclusion**: Clear recommendation (Approved / Request Changes).

#### Tone

- Be constructive, professional, and friendly.
- Explain _why_ a change is requested.
- For approvals, acknowledge the specific value of the contribution.

### 5. Interactive Refinement

1.  **Present Draft**: Show the drafted review feedback to the user.
2.  **Solicit Input**: Ask the user for their thoughts.
    - "Does this feedback look accurate?"
    - "Is the tone appropriate?"
    - "Did I miss any context?"
3.  **Iterate**: If the user provides suggestions or corrections, update the
    draft feedback accordingly.
4.  **Finalize**: specific approval from the user is not strictly required if
    they don't have further comments, but ensure they have a chance to respond.

### 6. Cleanup (Remote PRs only)

- After the review is complete, ask the user if they want to switch back to the
  default branch (e.g., `main` or `master`).
