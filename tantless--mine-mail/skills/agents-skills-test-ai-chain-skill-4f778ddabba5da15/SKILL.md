# Test Mine Mail AI Chain

Run the repository's ignored, billable AI integration suite only after an explicit
`$test-ai-chain` invocation. Never add it to a routine test command or automation.

## Required input

- Require the user to open the exact target email in Mine Mail immediately before
  invoking this Skill. Use the locally recorded most-recent body access only.
- Require `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in the current process environment.
- Default to model `deepseek-v4-pro` and `https://api.deepseek.com`; accept an explicit
  model or compatible DeepSeek base URL override from the user.
- Explain that one manual run performs six API-backed cases and can incur charges.
- Treat the explicit Skill invocation plus the user's confirmation that the target
  email is currently open as authority for that one run. Ask for that confirmation
  before running; do not choose another message.

The selected message must already have a cached plain-text body and recent local access
time. The suite never fetches mail, sends mail,
marks mail read, saves a draft, applies a proposal, or changes the product AI config.

## Run

From the repository root, run exactly:

```powershell
& .\.agents\skills\test-ai-chain\scripts\run-ai-chain.ps1 `
  -ConfirmBillableRun
```

Pass `-Model` or `-BaseUrl` only when the user explicitly overrides the defaults.
Never echo, inspect, or persist `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`.

The suite covers:

1. one mock-draft optimization with a mandatory real change;
2. Auto mode comprehensive read-only analysis;
3. Chat mode explicit generation authorization and rewrite proposal;
4. Generate mode contact search, recipient/subject/body edits, stationery, and
   language/paragraph preservation in one proposal;
5. one cached real email translated to Simplified Chinese;
6. the same cached real email translated to English.

## Report

Report passed/total cases, provider, protocol, model, per-case duration, completed
tool count, changed fields, optimization decision, byte count, and short SHA-256
digests. Do not report subjects, addresses, bodies, raw model output, API keys,
database paths, or full local paths. If a case fails, identify its name and the
privacy-safe error; do not retry automatically because retries can duplicate cost.
