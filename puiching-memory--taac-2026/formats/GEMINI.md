# AGENTS.md

This repository is the TAAC 2026 experiment workspace. It combines reusable PCVR
training, evaluation, inference, online bundle packaging, directory-based
experiment packages, tests, and documentation.

Use this file as the operating guide for AI coding agents working in this repo.

## Project Shape

- `src/taac2026/` contains shared framework code.
- `experiments/` contains loadable experiment packages.
- `docs/` contains Zensical documentation source.
- `tests/` contains unit, contract, integration, benchmark, and GPU tests.
- `run.sh` is the local and bundle-compatible command entrypoint.
- `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` define the Python environment.

Keep experiment packages thin. Shared training, evaluation, inference, data
pipeline, checkpoint, optimizer, accelerator, and packaging behavior belongs
under `src/taac2026/`, not copied into `experiments/`.

## Read First

Before changing non-trivial code, read the relevant docs:

- `README.md` for project overview and common commands.
- `docs/architecture.md` for layering and module responsibilities.
- `docs/guide/testing.md` for validation commands.
- `docs/guide/online-training-bundle.md` when touching packaging or platform
  bundle behavior.
- `docs/experiments/index.md` and the specific experiment doc when changing an
  experiment package.

## Environment

This is a Linux-only project managed by `uv`.

Common setup:

```bash
uv sync --locked --extra dev --extra cuda126
```

CPU-only unit work may only need:

```bash
uv sync --locked --extra dev
```

Do not hand-edit `uv.lock` unless dependency changes require it. Use `uv`
commands to update lock state.

## Common Commands

Run unit tests:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit -q
```

Run CPU-safe PR-style checks:

```bash
uv run pytest -m "(unit or contract or integration or benchmark_cpu) and not gpu and not benchmark_gpu" -q
```

Run experiment package contract tests:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/contract/experiments/test_packages.py -q
uv run pytest tests/contract/experiments/test_runtime_contract_matrix.py -q
```

Run packaging/bootstrap tests:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/integration/application/packaging -q
uv run pytest tests/unit/application/bootstrap tests/integration/application/bootstrap -q
```

Run lint:

```bash
uv run ruff check .
```

Build docs strictly:

```bash
uv run zensical build --strict
```

Run a small CPU smoke train:

```bash
bash run.sh train \
  --experiment experiments/baseline \
  --run-dir outputs/baseline_smoke \
  --device cpu \
  --num_workers 0 \
  --batch_size 8 \
  --max_steps 1
```

## Layering Rules

Respect the dependency direction.

- `domain/`: pure contracts, config, schema, requests, metrics, sidecar, and
  model input contracts.
- `application/`: train/eval/infer/packaging/bootstrap workflows and CLI
  orchestration.
- `infrastructure/`: data, IO, runtime, modeling, optimization, accelerators,
  and platform utilities.
- `experiments/`: experiment name, defaults, model class, experiment-private
  layers, and experiment-private hooks.

Do not put CLI parsing, environment probing, or filesystem behavior in
`domain/`.

Do not put experiment selection policy into `infrastructure/`.

Do not duplicate shared runtime logic inside experiment packages.

## Experiment Package Rules

A normal experiment package should usually look like:

```text
experiments/my_experiment/
├── __init__.py
└── model.py
```

Optional private model code can go in `layers.py`.

`__init__.py` should normally expose `EXPERIMENT` using
`create_pcvr_experiment()`.

`model.py` must satisfy the PCVR runtime contract:

- `forward(inputs)` returns logits shaped `(B,)`.
- `predict(inputs)` returns `(logits, embeddings)`.
- Model construction must work from checkpoint sidecar config and schema.
- Sparse and dense parameters should be groupable by the shared optimizer logic.

Prefer shared imports from `taac2026.api` and
`taac2026.infrastructure.modeling` over local copies.

## Checkpoint And Sidecar Contract

A valid trained checkpoint directory must include:

```text
model.safetensors
schema.json
train_config.json
```

Do not assume `model.safetensors` alone is enough. Evaluation and inference
reconstruct schema, input contracts, NS config, model defaults, runtime
execution settings, and hooks from sidecar files.

Be careful when changing:

- `PCVRModelConfig`
- `PCVRTrainConfig`
- `PCVRNSConfig`
- `ModelInput`
- schema serialization
- checkpoint directory naming
- sidecar read/write behavior

## Data And Local Runs

Local PCVR smoke runs use the Hugging Face sample dataset through the repository
data path conventions. Do not add or require `--dataset-path` for normal local
PCVR smoke tests unless the relevant docs and code explicitly support it.

Online bundles receive real data paths from the platform. Keep local assumptions
separate from platform bundle behavior.

## Packaging Rules

When changing bundle behavior, verify both tests and actual zip contents.

Training bundle command:

```bash
uv run taac-package-train \
  --experiment experiments/baseline \
  --output-dir outputs/bundles/baseline_training \
  --json
```

Inference bundle command:

```bash
uv run taac-package-infer \
  --experiment experiments/baseline \
  --output-dir outputs/bundles/baseline_inference \
  --json
```

Inspect generated zip files when needed:

```bash
python -m zipfile -l outputs/bundles/baseline_training/code_package.zip | sed -n '1,120p'
```

A bundle should include the selected experiment package, required project source
under `src/taac2026`, required package metadata, and manifest files. It should
not include unrelated outputs, caches, tests, or unrelated experiment packages
unless intentionally required.

## Tests To Choose By Change

- Experiment `__init__.py`: run experiment contract tests.
- Experiment `model.py`: run experiment package tests and a CPU smoke train when
  feasible.
- Maintenance experiments: run maintenance experiment contract tests.
- Training CLI/workflow: run `tests/unit/application/training`.
- Evaluation/inference: run `tests/unit/application/evaluation`.
- Packaging/bootstrap: run packaging and bootstrap tests.
- Data pipeline: run `tests/unit/infrastructure/data`.
- Checkpoint/sidecar: run checkpoint tests and runtime contract matrix.
- Accelerators: run accelerator unit tests; GPU behavior needs CUDA validation.
- Docs: run `uv run zensical build --strict`.

## Documentation Rules

Docs source lives in `docs/`. Site navigation lives in `zensical.toml`.

When adding or moving docs:

- Update `zensical.toml` if the page should appear in navigation.
- Keep relative links valid.
- Run `uv run zensical build --strict`.
- Do not edit generated `site/` output as source.

## Coding Style

- Follow existing code style and local patterns.
- Prefer `pathlib.Path` over raw string path manipulation.
- Prefer structured parsers and typed config objects over ad hoc string parsing.
- Use Pydantic for payloads that cross JSON, manifest, sidecar, platform, or
  plugin boundaries. Inherit from `TAACBoundaryModel` so unknown fields are
  rejected consistently. Keep internal hot-path contexts, tensor carriers, and
  simple immutable defaults as dataclasses unless a boundary validator is
  actually needed.
- Keep comments short and useful.
- Do not proactively suppress runtime warnings with `warnings.filterwarnings`,
  `warnings.simplefilter`, `PYTHONWARNINGS`, pytest warning filters, or blanket
  command-line warning ignores. Warnings should stay visible unless a user
  explicitly asks for a narrowly justified exception.
- Avoid broad refactors while making narrow fixes.
- Do not commit generated caches, `outputs/`, `.venv/`, `site/`, or
  `__pycache__/`.

## Git Safety

The working tree may contain user changes. Do not revert changes you did not
make.

Avoid destructive commands such as:

```bash
git reset --hard
git checkout -- .
```

Only use destructive git operations when explicitly requested.

## Performance And GPU Notes

CPU tests do not prove CUDA, TileLang, or accelerator behavior. If touching
accelerator code, validate on a CUDA machine when possible and record:

- command
- commit
- GPU model
- CUDA version
- PyTorch version
- benchmark output path

Do not put heavy benchmarks into ordinary CI paths.

## Good Agent Behavior

Before editing, inspect the relevant files and tests. Make the smallest coherent
change that fits the existing architecture. After editing, run the narrowest
meaningful validation first, then broaden if the change touches shared contracts.

When unable to run a relevant validation command, state why and identify the
remaining risk.
