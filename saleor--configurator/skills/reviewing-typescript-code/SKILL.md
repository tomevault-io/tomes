# TypeScript Code Quality Patterns

## Overview

Project-specific code quality checklist for the Saleor Configurator codebase. Covers type safety conventions, error handling patterns, and architectural standards unique to this project.

## When to Use

- Adding entity types, services, repositories, comparators, formatters
- Implementing deployment stages or bootstrap methods
- Creating Zod schemas or error classes
- Reviewing code before commit or PR merge

## Quick Reference

| Convention | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| No `any` | Production code only; allowed in test mocks |
| Branded types | Use `EntitySlug`, `EntityName` for domain values |
| Error classes | Extend `BaseError` with error code |
| GraphQL errors | Wrap with `GraphQLError.fromCombinedError()` |
| Zod errors | Wrap with `ZodValidationError.fromZodError()` |
| Functions | 10-50 lines ideal, ~100 max |
| Style | Functional (`map`/`filter`/`flatMap`) over loops |

## Quality Checklist

### Type Safety

- [ ] No `any` types in production code
- [ ] No unsafe assertions (`as unknown as T`)
- [ ] No non-null assertions (`!`) without justification
- [ ] Branded types for domain values (`EntitySlug`, `EntityName`)
- [ ] Discriminated unions over inheritance
- [ ] `satisfies` for type validation with literal preservation
- [ ] `readonly` for immutable data

### Clean Code

- [ ] Single responsibility per function
- [ ] Functions under 50 lines (ideally)
- [ ] Meaningful, declarative names
- [ ] Boolean names use `is`/`has`/`should`/`can` prefix
- [ ] Named constants instead of magic numbers
- [ ] Registry/strategy pattern for long conditional chains
- [ ] Arrow functions for consistency

### Functional Patterns

- [ ] No direct mutation of arrays/objects
- [ ] `map`/`filter`/`flatMap` over `for`/`forEach` loops
- [ ] No accumulating spreads in `reduce` (use `Map`)

### Error Handling

- [ ] Custom errors extend `BaseError` with error code
- [ ] GraphQL errors: `GraphQLError.fromCombinedError()`
- [ ] Zod errors: `ZodValidationError.fromZodError()`
- [ ] Error messages are actionable with recovery suggestions
- [ ] Error includes relevant context

## Review Output Format

Structure findings as:

### Critical Issues
Items that must be fixed before merge.

### Important Improvements
Items that should be addressed but are not blocking.

### Suggestions
Nice-to-have improvements for future consideration.

### Positive Observations
Well-implemented patterns worth highlighting.

## Project-Specific Conventions

- **Entity identification**: Slug-based (categories, products) vs Name-based (productTypes, pageTypes)
- **Service pattern**: Constructor DI with validator, repository, logger
- **Repository pattern**: GraphQL operations encapsulated, responses mapped to domain models
- **Test pattern**: `vi.fn()` mocks with schema-generated test data
- **Zod-first**: Define schemas before implementing logic; use `z.infer<>` for types

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Using `any` in production code | Use `unknown` + type guards |
| Exposing GraphQL types to services | Map to domain types in repository |
| Missing error context in GraphQL calls | Include operation name in error |
| Long `if-else` chains | Refactor to registry/strategy pattern |
| Accumulating spreads in `reduce` | Use `Map` or `Object.fromEntries` |
| Mutation in loops (`push`) | Use `map`/`filter`/`flatMap` |
