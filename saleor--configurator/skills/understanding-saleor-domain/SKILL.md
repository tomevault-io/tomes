# Saleor Domain Expert

## Overview

Deep domain knowledge about the Saleor e-commerce platform and the Configurator's business logic for entity management, configuration, deployment, and synchronization.

## When to Use

- Implementing new entity types or features
- Understanding entity identification patterns (slug vs name)
- Working with deployment pipeline stages
- Debugging configuration synchronization issues
- Understanding business rules and constraints

## Quick Reference

| CLI Command | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `pnpm dev introspect` | Download remote config to local YAML |
| `pnpm dev deploy` | Apply local YAML to remote Saleor |
| `pnpm dev diff` | Compare local vs remote config |
| `pnpm dev start` | Interactive first-time setup |

## Core Concepts

A "commerce as code" CLI tool for declarative configuration management of Saleor e-commerce platforms:
- Single source of truth for store state (YAML in git)
- Version-controlled, reproducible deployments
- Declarative over imperative management

## Entity Identification System

**Critical Rule**: Every entity has exactly ONE identification strategy.

### Slug-Based Entities

Identified by `slug` field (URL-friendly identifiers):

| Entity | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Categories | `electronics` |
| Channels | `default-channel` |
| Collections | `summer-sale` |
| Menus | `main-navigation` |
| Products | `iphone-15-pro` |
| Warehouses | `us-east-warehouse` |

### Name-Based Entities

Identified by `name` field (internal configuration):

| Entity | Example |
|--------|---------|
| ProductTypes | `Physical Product` |
| PageTypes | `Blog Post` |
| TaxClasses | `Standard Rate` |
| ShippingZones | `North America` |
| Attributes | `Color` |

### Singleton Entities

Only one instance exists (no identifier needed): **Shop** (global store settings).

## Deployment Pipeline

### Stage Order (Dependencies Matter)

```
1. Validation       -> Pre-flight checks
2. Shop Settings    -> Global configuration
3. Product Types    -> Must exist before products
4. Page Types       -> Must exist before pages
5. Attributes       -> Used by product/page types
6. Categories       -> Product organization
7. Collections      -> Product groupings
8. Warehouses       -> Required for inventory
9. Shipping Zones   -> Geographic shipping rules
10. Products        -> Depends on types, categories
11. Tax Config      -> Tax rules and classes
12. Channels        -> Sales channels
13. Menus           -> Navigation (may reference products)
14. Models          -> Custom data models
```

**Key dependency**: Cannot create a Product without its ProductType existing first.

### Stage Execution Pattern

Each stage follows: Fetch remote state -> Compare local vs remote -> Plan creates/updates/deletes -> Execute with chunking -> Report results.

## Configuration Schema

Top-level keys: `shop`, `channels`, `taxClasses`, `productTypes`, `pageTypes`, `attributes`, `categories`, `collections`, `warehouses`, `shippingZones`, `products`, `menus`, `models`. See `designing-zod-schemas` skill and `src/modules/config/schema/schema.ts` for full schema details.

## Bulk Operations

Large operations are chunked (default: 50 items per chunk) to avoid timeouts. The GraphQL client handles HTTP 429 automatically with exponential backoff (max 5 retries).

## Diff & Comparison Logic

### Comparison Dimensions

For each entity type: **Existence** (does it exist remotely?), **Equality** (are fields equal?), **Children** (are nested structures equal?).

### Diff Result Types

Actions: `create`, `update`, `delete`, `unchanged`. Each entity has a dedicated comparator (e.g., `src/core/diff/comparators/category-comparator.ts`) that matches by slug or name.

## Common Patterns

### Adding a New Entity Type

1. Define Zod schema in `src/modules/config/schema/`
2. Create service in `src/modules/<entity>/`
3. Create repository with GraphQL operations
4. Add comparator in `src/core/diff/comparators/`
5. Add deployment stage in pipeline
6. Update schema documentation

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Wrong identification strategy | Check entity table: slug-based vs name-based |
| Creating entity before dependency | Follow deployment pipeline order |
| Missing chunking for bulk ops | Use `splitIntoChunks()` with default chunk size |
| Not handling rate limits | Use urql retry exchange (built-in) |
