# MANDATORY Tool Restrictions

## REQUIRED TOOLS:
- **`AskUserQuestion`** — Preserve the one-question-at-a-time interaction pattern for every question in this skill, including gathering context and validating drafts. In Claude Code, use the tool. In Codex, ask one concise plain-text question at a time unless a structured question tool is actually available in the current mode. Keep context before the question to 2-3 sentences max, and do not narrate missing tools or fallbacks to the user.
</tool_restrictions>

<arc_runtime>
Arc-owned files live under the Arc install root for full-runtime installs.

Set `${ARC_ROOT}` to that root and use `${ARC_ROOT}/...` for Arc bundle files such as
`references/`, `disciplines/`, `agents/`, `templates/`, `scripts/`, and `rules/`.

Project-local files stay relative to the user's repository.
</arc_runtime>

# Vision Workflow

Create or review a 500-700 word vision document that captures the high-level goals and purpose of the app or codebase.

<progress_context>
**Use Read tool:** `docs/arc/progress.md` (first 50 lines)

Check for recent work that might inform vision decisions.
</progress_context>

## Process

### Step 1: Check for Existing Vision

**Use Read tool:** `docs/vision.md`

**If file exists:** Read it, then ask:
```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "I found an existing vision document. What would you like to do?"
  header: "Existing Vision"
  options:
    - label: "Review and discuss"
      description: "Walk through the current vision and talk through it"
    - label: "Update"
      description: "Revise the vision based on a new direction"
    - label: "Start fresh"
      description: "Discard the current vision and write a new one"
```

**If not exists:** Proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2: Gather Context

Ask one question at a time. Wait for the user's response before asking the next question.

**Question 1:**
```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What is this project? (one sentence)"
  header: "Project Identity"
  options:
    - label: "I'll describe it"
      description: "Type a one-sentence description of what you're building"
```

**Question 2:**
```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Who is it for?"
  header: "Target Audience"
  options:
    - label: "I'll describe them"
      description: "Type who the target users or audience are"
```

**Question 3:**
```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What problem does it solve?"
  header: "Core Problem"
  options:
    - label: "I'll explain"
      description: "Type the problem this project addresses"
```

**Question 4:**
```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What does success look like?"
  header: "Success Criteria"
  options:
    - label: "I'll define it"
      description: "Type what success means for this project"
```

**Question 5:**
```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Any constraints or non-goals?"
  header: "Constraints"
  options:
    - label: "Yes, I have some"
      description: "Type constraints or things you're explicitly not building"
    - label: "None right now"
      description: "Skip this and move on to drafting"
```

### Step 3: Draft Vision

Write a 500-700 word vision document covering:

```markdown
# Vision

## Purpose
[One paragraph: What is this and why does it exist?]

## Goals
[3-5 bullet points: What are we trying to achieve?]

## Target Users
[Who is this for? What do they need?]

## Success Criteria
[How do we know if we've succeeded?]

## Non-Goals
[What are we explicitly NOT trying to do?]

## Principles
[2-3 guiding principles for decisions]
```

### Step 4: Validate

Present the draft in sections. After each section, ask:
```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Does this capture it?"
  header: "Section Review"
  options:
    - label: "Yes, looks good"
      description: "Move on to the next section"
    - label: "Needs changes"
      description: "I'll tell you what to adjust"
    - label: "Start this section over"
      description: "Rewrite this section from scratch"
```

### Step 5: Save

```bash
mkdir -p docs
# Write to docs/vision.md
git add docs/vision.md
git commit -m "docs: add project vision"
```

<arc_log>
**After completing this skill, append to the activity log.**
See: `${ARC_ROOT}/references/arc-log.md`

Entry: `/arc:vision — [Created / Updated] vision document`
</arc_log>

## Interop

- **/arc:ideate** reads vision for context
- **/arc:suggest** references vision as lowest-priority source
- **/arc:letsgo** checks vision alignment
