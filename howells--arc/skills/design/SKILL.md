# MANDATORY Tool Restrictions

## BANNED TOOLS — calling these is a skill violation:
- **`EnterPlanMode`** — BANNED. Do NOT call this tool. This skill has its own multi-phase design process. Execute the phases below directly.
- **`ExitPlanMode`** — BANNED. You are never in plan mode.
</tool_restrictions>

# Design Workflow

Create distinctive, non-generic UI. Avoids AI slop (purple gradients, cookie-cutter layouts).

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the design skill to create distinctive, non-generic UI."

<important>
**This skill is user-interactive. Do NOT spawn agents to do design work.**

- This skill walks through design decisions WITH the user — it's collaborative, not delegated
- There is no `arc:design:designer` agent — design creation happens through this skill
- `arc:review:designer` exists but is for REVIEWING implementations AFTER they're built, not for creating designs
- If asked to "design X", follow this skill's phases; don't try to spawn an agent
</important>

---

## Agents

**This skill works with these agents (reuse, don't duplicate):**

| Agent | Location | When to Use |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `ui-builder` | agents/build/ | Build UI from the change spec you create |
| `figma-builder` | agents/build/ | Build UI when Figma URL is provided |
| `design-specifier` | agents/build/ | Quick design decisions during implement (empty states, dropdowns) |
| `designer` | agents/review/ | Review implemented UI for AI slop |

**Workflow:**
```
/arc:design (this skill)
     ↓ creates change spec
ui-builder or figma-builder (builds it)
     ↓ implements
designer (reviews for AI slop)
```

## Phase 0: Load References & Design Context (MANDATORY)

**You MUST read these files before proceeding. Do not skip this step.**

<required_reading>
**Read ALL of these using the Read tool:**

1. `references/frontend-design.md` — UI fonts, anti-patterns, design review checklist. **Critical.**
2. `references/brand-identity.md` — Brand typography, color psychology, visual character (if no brand-system.md exists)
3. `references/design-philosophy.md` — Timeless principles from Refactoring UI
4. `references/ux-laws.md` — Psychology-based design principles: Fitts's, Hick's, Gestalt, Jakob's Law, Doherty Threshold
5. `references/typography-opentype.md` — OpenType features, tracking, text-wrap, fluid sizing
6. `references/ascii-ui-patterns.md` — Wireframe syntax and patterns
7. `references/wiretext.md` — When to use WireText vs ASCII vs browser review

**Then load interface rules:**
5. `rules/interface/index.md` — Interface rules index

**And relevant domain rules based on what you're designing:**
- `rules/interface/design.md` — Visual principles
- `rules/interface/colors.md` — Color palettes, OKLCH, tinted neutrals
- `rules/interface/spacing.md` — Spacing system, container queries
- `rules/interface/typography.md` — Typography rules, OpenType features
- `rules/interface/layout.md` — Layout patterns, z-index
- `rules/interface/responsive.md` — Responsive design, input detection
- `rules/interface/animation.md` — If motion is involved
- `rules/interface/forms.md` — If designing forms
- `rules/interface/interactions.md` — Interactive states, popover API
- `rules/interface/marketing.md` — If designing marketing pages
- `rules/interface/app-ui.md` — If designing app UI (dashboards, settings, data views)
</required_reading>

### Brand System & Design Context

**Check for `docs/brand-system.md` first, then `docs/design-context.md`.**

If `brand-system.md` exists (created by `/arc:brand`), load it — this is the canonical source for palette, typography, tone, and visual character. **Do not re-ask brand questions.** Inherit all identity decisions and focus this skill on feature-level UI design.

If only `design-context.md` exists, load it — this file contains project-wide aesthetic decisions (brand colors, chosen fonts, spacing scale, tone) that all design work should inherit. **Do not re-ask questions that are already answered in design-context.md.** Skip to Phase 1 for any established decisions.

If it does NOT exist, offer to create one:

**Use AskUserQuestion:**
```
Question: "No project-wide design context found. Want to establish one? This saves brand decisions (colors, fonts, tone) so every future design session inherits them."
Header: "Design context"
Options:
  1. "Yes, establish context" (Recommended) — Create docs/design-context.md with persistent aesthetic decisions
  2. "No, one-off design" — Proceed without persistent context
```

**If creating context, gather and save to `docs/design-context.md`:**

```markdown
# Design Context

Persistent aesthetic decisions for this project. All design work inherits these choices.

## Brand
- **Name**: [project name]
- **Personality**: [e.g., confident and technical, warm and approachable]
- **Tone**: [chosen from tone options]

## Typography
- **Display font**: [specific font]
- **Body font**: [specific font]
- **Mono font**: [specific font, if applicable]

## Color Palette (Tailwind @theme)
```css
@theme {
  --color-brand-500: oklch(... ... ...);
  /* Full shade scale */
  --color-gray-500: oklch(... ... ...);
  /* Tinted neutral scale */
}
```

## Spacing
- **Base unit**: 4px
- **Scale**: Tailwind default (p-1=4px through p-16=64px)

## Motion Philosophy
- **Style**: [e.g., snappy and confident, smooth and refined]
- **Library**: [CSS transitions / motion/react]

## Memorable Element
- [What makes this project's UI distinctive]

## Anti-Patterns (Project-Specific)
- [Anything specifically to avoid for this project]
```

After creating, proceed to Phase 1.

<progress_context>
**Use Read tool:** `docs/arc/progress.md` (first 50 lines)

Check for related prior design work and aesthetic decisions.
</progress_context>

---

## Phase 1: Visual Reconnaissance

**Before designing anything, see what exists.**

### If Redesigning Existing UI:

**Prefer Chrome MCP to capture current state. If unavailable, use `agent-browser`. If neither is available, ask for screenshots or review the code directly.**

```
1. mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_context_mcp (get available tabs)
2. mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_create_mcp (create new tab if needed)
3. mcp__claude-in-chrome__navigate to the local dev URL
4. mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer action=screenshot
```

**Analyze the screenshot against the Design Review Checklist from frontend-design.md:**
- Does it have any Red Flags (AI slop indicators)?
- What's the current aesthetic direction (if any)?
- What's working? What's not?

**Report findings to user:** "Here's what I see in the current UI: [observations]. The main issues are: [problems]."

### If Designing From Scratch:

- Confirm dev server is running (or will be)
- Ask if there's any existing brand/style guide to reference
- Check if there are reference designs or inspiration URLs to screenshot

---

## Phase 1.5: Design Mode

**Before gathering direction, establish what kind of UI you're designing.**

**Use AskUserQuestion:**
```
Question: "What are you designing?"
Header: "Design mode"
Options:
  1. "Marketing page" — Landing page, homepage, pricing, about, blog. Goal: persuade and convert.
  2. "App UI" — Dashboard, settings, forms, data views. Goal: enable and orient.
```

**After selection:**
- **Marketing** → Load `rules/interface/marketing.md` as mandatory reference
- **App UI** → Load `rules/interface/app-ui.md` as mandatory reference

This mode context informs all subsequent phases — questions, research sources, wireframe patterns, and checklist items adapt accordingly.

---

## Phase 2: Gather Direction

### Question 0: Exploration Mode (Conditional)

**Offer this option when circumstances allow:**
- New project with no established design system
- Homepage, landing page, or marketing site design
- User seems uncertain about direction
- Greenfield UI with creative freedom

**Do NOT offer when:**
- Strict brand guidelines exist
- Designing a small component or iteration
- User has already specified a clear direction
- Adding to an existing design system

**If circumstances allow, use AskUserQuestion:**
```
Question: "Would you like me to create 5 vastly different design directions, each at its own route? This lets you compare radically different approaches before committing."
Header: "Exploration"
Options:
  1. "Yes, explore 5 directions" — Create /design-1 through /design-5 with completely different aesthetics
  2. "No, single direction" (Recommended) — Focus on one well-crafted design
```

**If exploration mode is chosen:**
- Each route (/design-1, /design-2, etc.) gets a completely different aesthetic
- Vary: color palette, typography, layout structure, tone, spatial composition
- Don't just tweak—make them *unrecognizable* from each other
- After building all 5, ask user which direction resonates
- Then proceed with full design doc for the chosen direction

---

Ask the remaining questions **one at a time**:

### Question 1: Tone
"What tone fits this UI?"
- Minimal, bold, playful, editorial, luxury, brutalist, retro, organic, industrial, art deco, soft/pastel

### Question 1.5: Mode-Specific Question

**If Marketing mode:**
"How does the page tell its story?"
- Hero → problem → solution → proof → CTA (classic)
- Immersive scroll narrative (one idea per viewport)
- Feature showcase (dense, scannable)
- Minimal single-screen (everything above the fold)
- Editorial long-form (article-like)

**If App UI mode:**
"How information-dense should this be?"
- Sparse — generous whitespace, one focus per screen (e.g., onboarding)
- Balanced — comfortable density, clear hierarchy (e.g., settings)
- Dense — lots of data visible at once (e.g., dashboard, table views)

### Question 2: Memorable Element
"What should be memorable about this?"

**If Marketing:** The animation? Typography drama? Layout surprise? Photography style? Scroll behavior?

**If App UI:** The navigation paradigm? Micro-interactions? Information density approach? Empty state creativity? Data visualization style?

### Question 3: Existing Constraints
"Any existing brand/style to match, or fresh start?"

### Question 4: Inspiration
"Any reference designs or inspiration?"
- If provided, **screenshot them immediately using Chrome MCP** for visual reference

### Question 5: UI Chrome
"Should this have standard website chrome (header, footer, navigation), or feel more like an app?"

Consider:
- **Standard website chrome** — Fixed header with logo/nav, footer with links. Good for content sites, marketing pages, multi-page experiences where users need to navigate.
- **App-like experience** — Minimal or no persistent chrome. Content takes full focus. Good for tools, dashboards, immersive experiences, single-purpose flows.
- **Hybrid** — Minimal header (maybe just a logo), no footer. Common for SaaS apps.

**The default shouldn't always be "header + footer".** If the experience is focused (a tool, a game, a single flow), standard chrome can feel clunky and distract from the core experience. Let the purpose guide the frame.

---

## Phase 3: Research Inspiration (Optional)

**Use WebFetch to explore curated design examples based on the chosen direction.**

This phase is optional but recommended when:
- Starting from scratch with no existing references
- The user wants to see examples matching their chosen tone
- You need concrete visual patterns to inform decisions

### Siteinspire (Website/Homepage Design)

Siteinspire curates high-quality website designs. Use WebFetch to explore based on the chosen tone:

```
WebFetch URL patterns by tone:
- Minimal:    https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?style=minimal
- Bold:       https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?style=bold
- Playful:    https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?style=playful
- Editorial:  https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?style=editorial
- Luxury:     https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?style=luxury
- Brutalist:  https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?style=brutalist
- Retro:      https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?style=retro
- Organic:    https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?style=organic

By page type:
- Homepage:   https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?page=homepage
- Portfolio:  https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?page=portfolio
- E-commerce: https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?page=e-commerce
- Blog:       https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?page=blog
```

**WebFetch prompt:** "List the website names, their URLs, and a brief description of their visual style. Focus on typography choices, color palettes, and layout patterns."

### Mobbin (UI/Mobile Design Patterns)

Mobbin collects UI patterns from real apps. Use for component and interaction inspiration:

```
WebFetch URL patterns:
- iOS apps:     https://mobbin.com/browse/ios/apps
- Android:      https://mobbin.com/browse/android/apps
- Web apps:     https://mobbin.com/browse/web/apps

By screen type:
- Onboarding:   https://mobbin.com/browse/ios/screens?screen=onboarding
- Dashboard:    https://mobbin.com/browse/ios/screens?screen=dashboard
- Settings:     https://mobbin.com/browse/ios/screens?screen=settings
- Profile:      https://mobbin.com/browse/ios/screens?screen=profile
- Search:       https://mobbin.com/browse/ios/screens?screen=search
```

**WebFetch prompt:** "List the apps shown and describe their UI patterns—navigation style, card layouts, typography hierarchy, and interaction patterns."

### Research Workflow

1. **Based on user's chosen tone**, fetch 1-2 relevant Siteinspire pages
2. **Based on what you're designing** (homepage, dashboard, form), fetch relevant Mobbin screens
3. **Summarize findings** to user: "I found these patterns that match your direction: [observations]"
4. **Ask:** "Any of these resonate? Should I explore a specific site further with Chrome MCP?"

### Deep Dive with Chrome MCP

If a specific example catches interest, use Chrome MCP for detailed inspection:

```
1. mcp__claude-in-chrome__navigate to the specific site URL
2. mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer action=screenshot
3. Analyze: typography, colors, spacing, layout patterns
4. Report specific values observed (font names, hex colors, spacing)
```

**Note:** WebFetch provides quick overview; Chrome MCP provides detailed visual inspection. Use both strategically.

---

## Phase 4: Make Concrete Visual Decisions

**Capture SPECIFIC visual decisions, not conceptual themes.**

<principle>
**Complexity Matching:** Design complexity should align with aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs warrant elaborate code and rich details. Minimalist designs require restraint and precision—every element must earn its place. Don't add flourishes to a minimal design; don't under-build a maximalist one.
</principle>

Apply knowledge from the loaded references to make these decisions:

### Typography Selection
Using the font recommendations from `frontend-design.md`:
- **Display font:** [specific font name]
- **Body font:** [specific font name]
- **Mono font (if needed):** [specific font name]

**Never use:** Roboto, Arial, system-ui defaults, Instrument Serif (AI slop)

### Color Palette
- **Background:** [specific hex, e.g., #0a0a0a]
- **Surface/card:** [specific hex]
- **Text primary:** [specific hex]
- **Text secondary:** [specific hex]
- **Accent:** [specific hex]
- **Accent hover:** [specific hex]

**Never use:** Purple-to-blue gradients (AI cliché)

### Spacing System
Define the scale being used:
- **Base unit:** 4px or 8px
- **Common values:** 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64
- **Component padding:** [e.g., 16px default, 24px for cards]
- **Section spacing:** [e.g., 64px between major sections]

### Spatial Composition
Beyond basic layout, make deliberate choices about:
- **Asymmetry:** Not everything needs to be centered or perfectly balanced
- **Overlap:** Elements can break grid boundaries, bleed off edges, layer on top of each other
- **Unexpected layouts:** Break the "header → hero → 3-column features → footer" pattern
- **Negative space:** Generous whitespace creates breathing room and draws focus to what matters

**Ask:** "Where can the layout do something unexpected?"

### Motion Philosophy
- **Where animation is used:** [specific locations]
- **Animation style:** [e.g., ease-out for enters, springs for interactive]
- **Duration range:** [e.g., 150-300ms]

---

## Phase 5: Wireframe

**Create a structural wireframe before any code.**

Prefer WireText MCP when available for low-fidelity wireframes. If WireText is unavailable, create ASCII wireframes using patterns from `ascii-ui-patterns.md`.

If WireText is used:
- save the editable URL in the design doc
- capture the exported wireframe text or a short structural summary
- treat it as the source of layout structure, not visual fidelity

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Logo        [Search...]    [Menu]  │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│  [Main Content Area]                │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Include:**
1. Primary layout structure
2. Key interactive elements
3. Mobile version if responsive
4. States: empty, loading, error (where relevant)

**If App UI mode:** You MUST include at least one state variant beyond the populated state (empty, loading, or error). App UI without state design is incomplete.

**Ask:** "Does this structure feel right before I continue?"

---

## Phase 5.5: Create Change Spec

**THIS IS CRITICAL.** Translate aesthetic direction into **specific, measurable changes**:

```markdown
## Change Spec

### Typography
| Element | Before | After | Rule Reference |
|---------|--------|-------|----------------|
| h1 | 24px Inter regular | 48px Instrument Serif bold | typography.md: display hierarchy |
| body | 14px system-ui | 16px/1.6 DM Sans | typography.md: body readability |

### Colors
| Element | Before | After | Rule Reference |
|---------|--------|-------|----------------|
| background | white #fff | warm off-white #faf9f7 | colors.md: warmth |
| accent | none | coral #ff6b4a | colors.md: accent strategy |

### Spacing
| Element | Before | After | Rule Reference |
|---------|--------|-------|----------------|
| section padding | p-4 (16px) | p-12 (48px) | spacing.md: generous whitespace |

### Layout
| Element | Before | After | Rule Reference |
|---------|--------|-------|----------------|
| hero | centered text | asymmetric split with image overlap | layout.md: break the grid |

### Motion (if applicable)
| Element | Before | After | Rule Reference |
|---------|--------|-------|----------------|
| page load | none | staggered fade-up, 50ms delay | animation.md: entrance sequence |
```

**Rules for change specs:**
- Every change references a rule from the interface rules
- Changes must be **substantial**, not tweaks
- Specific values, not vague descriptions

**Self-check:**
- [ ] At least 3 typography changes?
- [ ] Color palette actually different?
- [ ] Spacing significantly adjusted?
- [ ] Memorable element clearly identified and designed?

**If you're only changing padding values, STOP. That's not a redesign.**

---

## Phase 6: Produce Design Document

**Create the design direction document at `docs/arc/specs/design-[component-name].md`:**

```markdown
# Design Direction: [Component/Page Name]

## Aesthetic Direction
- **Tone:** [chosen - e.g., "minimal", "bold", "editorial"]
- **Memorable element:** [specific - e.g., "oversized typography", "micro-interactions on hover"]

## Typography
- **Display:** [font name] — [where used]
- **Body:** [font name] — [where used]
- **Mono:** [font name] — [where used, if applicable]

## Color Palette
| Role | Value | Usage |
|------|-------|-------|
| Background | #0a0a0a | Page background |
| Surface | #1a1a1a | Cards, panels |
| Text primary | #fafafa | Headings, body |
| Text secondary | #a1a1a1 | Labels, hints |
| Accent | #f59e0b | CTAs, links |
| Accent hover | #fbbf24 | Hover states |

## Spacing
- Base unit: 8px
- Component padding: 16px (small), 24px (medium), 32px (large)
- Section gaps: 48px (tight), 64px (normal), 96px (generous)

## Motion
- Page transitions: fade, 200ms ease-out
- Interactive elements: spring (stiffness: 400, damping: 25)
- Hover states: 150ms ease-out

## Layout

### Desktop
[ASCII wireframe]

### Mobile
[ASCII wireframe]

## Implementation Notes
- [Any specific technical considerations]
- [Component library preferences]
- [Animation library: CSS-only vs motion/react]

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- [Specific things NOT to do for this design]
```

---

## Phase 7: Verify Against Checklist

**Run the Design Review Checklist from frontend-design.md:**

### Red Flags (must be zero)
- [ ] Uses default system fonts
- [ ] Purple-to-blue gradient present
- [ ] White background + gray cards throughout
- [ ] Could be mistaken for generic AI output

### Green Flags (should have most)
- [ ] Clear aesthetic direction documented
- [ ] Typography is deliberate
- [ ] At least one memorable element
- [ ] Layout has unexpected decisions

### If Marketing Mode, also check:
- [ ] **Red Flag:** Cookie-cutter hero → features → testimonials → CTA layout
- [ ] **Red Flag:** No clear narrative structure
- [ ] **Green Flag:** Section rhythm creates breathing room
- [ ] **Green Flag:** Would pass the "screenshot test" — distinctive in a grid of competitors

### If App UI Mode, also check:
- [ ] **Red Flag:** No empty state designed
- [ ] **Red Flag:** Generic admin template feel
- [ ] **Red Flag:** Fails the swap test — choices are defaults, not decisions (see app-ui.md)
- [ ] **Green Flag:** Could use this for 8 hours without visual fatigue
- [ ] **Green Flag:** All critical states designed (empty, loaded, error)

**If any Red Flags are present, revise before proceeding.**

---

## Phase 8: Hand Off

**Use AskUserQuestion tool:**
```
Question: "Design documented. What's next?"
Header: "Next step"
Options:
  1. "Create detailed plan" (Recommended) — Run /arc:detail for task breakdown
  2. "Save and stop" — Return to this later
```

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT automatically invoke other skills.**

- **If option 1:** Tell user: "Design saved. Run `/arc:detail` to create implementation tasks."
- **If option 2:** Tell user: "Design saved to `docs/arc/specs/design-[name].md`. Return anytime."

---

## During Implementation (Reference for /arc:implement)

When implementing this design (via /arc:implement), use Chrome MCP continuously when available. Outside Claude Code, prefer `agent-browser`, then Playwright.

### After Every Significant Change
```
mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer action=screenshot
```

### Check Responsive Behavior
```
mcp__claude-in-chrome__resize_window width=375 height=812  # Mobile
mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer action=screenshot
mcp__claude-in-chrome__resize_window width=1440 height=900 # Desktop
mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer action=screenshot
```

### Verify Against Design Doc
- Does the typography match what was specified?
- Are the colors exactly as documented?
- Does spacing feel consistent with the system?
- Is the memorable element actually memorable?

**Never commit UI code without visually verifying it looks correct.**

---

## Anti-Patterns (Quick Reference)

From `frontend-design.md`:

**🚫 Never use sparkles/stars to denote AI features.** Overused, meaningless, dated.

**🚫 Never propose conceptual themes with metaphors.** No "Direction: Darkroom / Metaphor: Photo emerging from developer bath". Instead: "Dark background (#0a0a0a) with warm red accents (#dc2626)."

**🚫 Never use these:**
- Roboto/Arial/system-ui defaults
- Purple-to-blue gradients
- White backgrounds with gray cards
- Rounded corners on everything
- Mixed icon styles

---

<arc_log>
**After completing this skill, append to the activity log.**
See: `references/arc-log.md`

Entry: `/arc:design — [Component/page] design ([aesthetic direction])`
</arc_log>

<success_criteria>
Design is complete when:
- [ ] Design mode identified (marketing or app UI)
- [ ] All mandatory references were loaded and applied (including mode-specific reference)
- [ ] Current UI was screenshotted (if redesigning)
- [ ] Aesthetic direction established with SPECIFIC values
- [ ] Typography selected from recommended fonts
- [ ] Color palette defined with hex values
- [ ] Spacing system documented
- [ ] Wireframes created and approved
- [ ] Design document saved to docs/arc/specs/
- [ ] Red flag checklist passed (zero red flags)
- [ ] Progress journal updated
</success_criteria>

## Interop

- Produces design doc consumed by **/arc:implement**
- Reads/creates **docs/design-context.md** for persistent project-wide aesthetic decisions
- Can invoke **web-design-guidelines** skill for compliance review (if available)
- Can invoke **vercel-composition-patterns** skill for component architecture review (if available)
- Uses **WireText MCP** for low-fidelity wireframes when available
- Uses **Chrome MCP** (`mcp__claude-in-chrome__*`) as the preferred rendered-page capture path in Claude Code
- Uses **agent-browser** as the preferred browser fallback outside Claude Code
- Uses **WebFetch** to research design inspiration from Siteinspire and Mobbin
- References feed into implementation to maintain design fidelity

### Related Refinement Skills
After implementation, suggest these for the final mile:
- **/arc:polish** — Pre-ship visual refinement (spacing, states, contrast)
- **/arc:distill** — Strip unnecessary complexity
- **/arc:animate** — Add purposeful motion
- **/arc:harden** — Production resilience (errors, overflow, i18n)
