# MANDATORY Tool Restrictions

## REQUIRED TOOLS — use these when specified in the process:
- **`AskUserQuestion`** — Preserve the one-question-at-a-time interaction pattern at every decision point marked with `AskUserQuestion:` in the process below. In Claude Code, use the tool. In Codex, ask one concise plain-text question at a time unless a structured question tool is actually available in the current mode. Do not narrate missing tools or fallbacks to the user.
</tool_restrictions>

<arc_runtime>
Arc-owned files live under the Arc install root for full-runtime installs.

Set `${ARC_ROOT}` to that root and use `${ARC_ROOT}/...` for Arc bundle files such as
`references/`, `disciplines/`, `agents/`, `templates/`, `scripts/`, and `rules/`.

Project-local files stay relative to the user's repository.
</arc_runtime>

<progress_context>
**Use Read tool:** `docs/arc/progress.md` (first 50 lines)

Check what's been done recently — ensures nothing is missed before shipping.
</progress_context>

# Letsgo Workflow

Prepare a codebase for production. Generates a **tailored checklist** based on project detection and user input—not a generic one-size-fits-all list.

## Process

### Step 1: Project Detection

Scan the codebase to understand what's present. Look for:

```
Detection signals:
├── Framework: package.json (next, remix, astro, etc.)
├── Auth: auth libraries, OAuth config, session handling
├── Payments: stripe, paddle, lemon-squeezy
├── Email: resend, sendgrid, postmark, nodemailer
├── Database: prisma, drizzle, supabase, planetscale
├── Analytics: GA, mixpanel, posthog, plausible
├── i18n: next-intl, i18next, locale files
├── CMS: sanity, contentful, payload
├── File uploads: stow, cloudinary, S3 config
└── Existing meta: robots.txt, sitemap, og images
```

Report findings:
```markdown
## Project Detection

**Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
**Detected features:**
- ✓ Authentication (NextAuth with Google, GitHub providers)
- ✓ Payments (Stripe)
- ✓ Database (Prisma + PostgreSQL)
- ✓ Email (Resend)
- ✗ i18n (not detected)
- ✗ Analytics (not configured)

**Existing production config:**
- ✓ robots.txt present
- ✗ sitemap.xml missing
- ✗ Site verification meta tags missing
```

### Step 2: Scope Questions

Ask the user to fill gaps detection can't cover. Ask each question one at a time:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Which platforms do you want to verify your site with?"
  header: "Site Verification Platforms"
  options:
    - label: "Google Search Console"
      description: "Essential for SEO monitoring and indexing"
    - label: "Bing Webmaster Tools"
      description: "Bing and Yahoo search visibility"
    - label: "Pinterest"
      description: "Enable Rich Pins and site analytics"
    - label: "Twitter/X"
      description: "Twitter analytics and card validation"
    - label: "Facebook/Meta"
      description: "Domain verification for ads and insights"
    - label: "Yandex"
      description: "Russian search engine visibility"
    - label: "None of these"
      description: "Skip site verification setup"
```

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What social sharing features do you need?"
  header: "Social Sharing"
  options:
    - label: "OG images for all pages"
      description: "Dynamic or static Open Graph images for every page"
    - label: "Twitter Cards"
      description: "Summary or large image cards for Twitter/X"
    - label: "LinkedIn sharing"
      description: "Optimized previews for LinkedIn posts"
    - label: "Pinterest Rich Pins"
      description: "Enhanced pins with metadata from your site"
    - label: "None"
      description: "Skip social sharing setup"
```

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Will you send email from a custom domain (e.g., hello@yourdomain.com)?"
  header: "Email Domain"
  options:
    - label: "Yes, custom domain"
      description: "Need SPF/DKIM/DMARC DNS records for deliverability"
    - label: "No, provider domain"
      description: "Using the email provider's default sending domain"
    - label: "Not sending email"
      description: "No transactional or marketing email"
```

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What compliance requirements apply to your project?"
  header: "Compliance"
  options:
    - label: "GDPR"
      description: "Required if you have EU users — consent, data rights, DPA"
    - label: "CCPA"
      description: "Required for California users — opt-out, disclosure"
    - label: "Cookie consent banner"
      description: "Banner with accept/reject before setting non-essential cookies"
    - label: "Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)"
      description: "Web accessibility compliance — audit and statement"
    - label: "None"
      description: "No specific compliance requirements"
```

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What type of launch is this?"
  header: "Launch Type"
  options:
    - label: "Soft launch"
      description: "Limited audience, no SEO push, testing in production"
    - label: "Public launch"
      description: "Full SEO, marketing, and social sharing"
    - label: "Migration"
      description: "Replacing an existing site — redirects and DNS cutover needed"
```

### Step 3: Generate Tailored Checklist

Based on detection + user input, generate ONLY relevant sections:

---

## Checklist Categories

### A. Domain & Hosting (Always)
- [ ] Domain purchased and configured
- [ ] DNS records set up (A/CNAME to Vercel)

*For a comprehensive SEO audit, run `/arc:seo`.*

### D. Social Sharing / Open Graph
- [ ] og:title, og:description, og:image set
- [ ] og:image is 1200x630px (optimal for all platforms)
- [ ] Twitter Card meta tags (twitter:card, twitter:title, etc.)
- [ ] Twitter Card type chosen (summary vs summary_large_image)
- [ ] **Validated with real tools:**
  - [ ] [Twitter Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)
  - [ ] [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/)
  - [ ] [LinkedIn Post Inspector](https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/)
  - [ ] [Pinterest Rich Pins Validator](https://developers.pinterest.com/tools/url-debugger/)

**Next.js OG Image Generation (Recommended for Next.js projects):**

Offer to set up dynamic OG images using Next.js built-in `ImageResponse`:

```typescript
// app/og/route.tsx - Dynamic OG image generation
import { ImageResponse } from 'next/og'

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)
  const title = searchParams.get('title') ?? 'Default Title'

  return new ImageResponse(
    (
      <div style={{ /* your design */ }}>
        <h1>{title}</h1>
      </div>
    ),
    { width: 1200, height: 630 }
  )
}
```

Then reference in metadata:
```typescript
// app/layout.tsx or page.tsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  openGraph: {
    images: ['/og?title=Your+Page+Title'],
  },
}
```

**⚠️ OG Image Design Quality:**

OG images are often the first impression of your product. Avoid:
- PowerPoint-style slides with generic gradients
- Stock photo backgrounds with overlaid text
- Default template looks (Canva templates, etc.)
- Tiny unreadable text
- Generic "hero image + title" layouts

**Use `/arc:design` to create distinctive OG image designs** that match your brand and stand out in social feeds. The OG image should feel like part of your product, not an afterthought.

Good OG images have:
- Clear visual hierarchy (title readable at thumbnail size)
- Brand colors and typography
- Memorable visual element or illustration
- Consistent style across all pages

### E. Favicons & App Icons
- [ ] favicon.ico (16x16, 32x32)
- [ ] apple-touch-icon.png (180x180)
- [ ] android-chrome icons (192x192, 512x512)
- [ ] site.webmanifest (if PWA)
- [ ] Theme color meta tag

**Next.js Metadata API (Recommended for Next.js projects):**

Next.js can auto-generate favicons from a single source. Offer to set up:

```
app/
├── icon.tsx          # Dynamic favicon (uses ImageResponse)
├── icon.png          # Or static favicon (auto-detected)
├── apple-icon.png    # Apple touch icon (auto-detected)
└── opengraph-image.tsx  # Dynamic OG image per route
```

Example dynamic favicon:
```typescript
// app/icon.tsx
import { ImageResponse } from 'next/og'

export const size = { width: 32, height: 32 }
export const contentType = 'image/png'

export default function Icon() {
  return new ImageResponse(
    (
      <div style={{
        fontSize: 24,
        background: '#000',
        color: '#fff',
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
        display: 'flex',
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
        borderRadius: 4,
      }}>
        A
      </div>
    ),
    { ...size }
  )
}
```

**⚠️ Favicon Design Quality:**

Favicons appear in browser tabs, bookmarks, and home screens. Avoid:
- Just shrinking your full logo (unreadable at 16px)
- Generic letter in a colored square
- Too much detail that becomes muddy

**Use `/arc:design` for favicon concepts** if you don't have a dedicated icon mark. Good favicons:
- Work at 16x16, 32x32, and 180x180 (apple-touch-icon)
- Use a simplified version of your brand mark
- Are recognizable in a sea of browser tabs
- Have sufficient contrast on both light and dark browser chrome

### F. Performance (Always)
- [ ] Images optimized (next/image, srcset, WebP/AVIF)
- [ ] Fonts optimized (display: swap, preload critical)
- [ ] Font rendering classes on body (see below)
- [ ] Bundle size reasonable (check with `next build` output)
- [ ] No console errors in production build
- [ ] Core Web Vitals passing (LCP, FID, CLS)
- [ ] Lighthouse score acceptable (aim for 90+)

**Font Rendering & Body Classes:**

Ensure the `<body>` has proper font rendering classes for crisp text:

```tsx
// Tailwind CSS
<body className="antialiased">

// Or with more control:
<body className="antialiased text-base leading-relaxed text-foreground bg-background">
```

If not using Tailwind, add equivalent CSS:
```css
body {
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;
}
```

Additional body-level considerations:
- [ ] `antialiased` class applied (smoother fonts on macOS/iOS)
- [ ] Base text color set (not relying on browser default black)
- [ ] Base background color set (prevents flash of white)
- [ ] `overflow-x-hidden` on html/body if using full-bleed sections
- [ ] `scroll-behavior: smooth` if desired (or Tailwind `scroll-smooth`)
- [ ] `min-h-screen` on body/main for proper footer positioning

**If React/Next.js and `vercel-react-best-practices` skill available:**
```
Invoke skill: vercel-react-best-practices
"Review performance patterns. Check: component rendering, data fetching, bundle optimization"
```

**If React Native/Expo and `vercel-react-native-skills` skill available:**
```
Invoke skill: vercel-react-native-skills
"Review React Native production readiness. Check: list performance, animation optimization, memory leaks, native module usage, Expo config"
```

### G. Security (Always)
- [ ] No secrets in client-side code (check bundle)

- [ ] Privacy policy includes EU-specific rights

**Accessibility:**
- [ ] Accessibility statement page (if WCAG compliance needed)
- [ ] Contact method for accessibility issues

**If legal documents are missing**, flag it as a checklist item for the user to address. Consider using a service like Termly, iubenda, or consulting a lawyer for production-ready legal pages.

### M. Analytics & Tracking (If user wants)

- [ ] Logo has proper spacing/clearance
- [ ] Dark mode logo variant used where needed
- [ ] Favicon matches current logo

**Brand name casing:**
- [ ] Product name cased consistently everywhere
- [ ] Check: page titles, meta tags, footer, emails, error messages
- [ ] Third-party brand names correctly cased (see common mistakes below)

**Common brand casing mistakes to check:**
```
WRONG          → CORRECT
Github         → GitHub
Javascript     → JavaScript
Typescript     → TypeScript
NextJS/Nextjs  → Next.js
NodeJS/Nodejs  → Node.js
VSCode         → VS Code
MacOS          → macOS
iOS (correct)  → iOS (not IOS)
PostgreSQL     → PostgreSQL (not Postgres in formal contexts)
MongoDB        → MongoDB (not Mongo in formal contexts)
LinkedIn       → LinkedIn (not Linkedin)
YouTube        → YouTube (not Youtube)
PayPal         → PayPal (not Paypal)
```

**Grep for inconsistencies:**
```bash
# Find potential casing issues (case-insensitive search, then review)
grep -ri "github\|javascript\|typescript\|nextjs\|nodejs" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" --include="*.md" | grep -v node_modules
```

**Brand colors:**
- [ ] Primary brand colors used consistently
- [ ] Colors defined in one place (CSS variables, Tailwind config)
- [ ] No hardcoded hex values that should use brand tokens

**Typography:**
- [ ] Brand fonts loaded and applied
- [ ] Font weights consistent with brand guidelines
- [ ] No system font fallbacks visible where brand fonts expected

**Voice & messaging:**
- [ ] Tagline consistent across touchpoints
- [ ] Product descriptions match (homepage, meta, social)
- [ ] CTA button text consistent ("Get Started" vs "Start Now" vs "Sign Up")

**Ask user for product name casing:**

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What is the exact casing for your product name? This will be used to find and fix inconsistencies across the codebase."
  header: "Brand Name Casing"
  options:
    - label: "PascalCase (e.g., MyApp)"
      description: "Each word capitalized, no spaces"
    - label: "camelCase (e.g., myApp)"
      description: "First word lowercase, rest capitalized"
    - label: "ALL CAPS (e.g., MYAPP)"
      description: "Every letter uppercase"
    - label: "lowercase (e.g., myapp)"
      description: "Every letter lowercase"
    - label: "Custom casing"
      description: "Something else — I'll type it out"
```

Then grep the codebase for variations and fix any inconsistencies.

### Q. Redirects (If migration)
- [ ] Old URLs mapped to new URLs
- [ ] 301 redirects configured in vercel.json or middleware
- [ ] www vs non-www canonical decided
- [ ] HTTP → HTTPS redirects (automatic on Vercel)

### R. Pre-Launch Testing
- [ ] Responsive audit completed (`/arc:responsive` if not done already)
- [ ] Test on real mobile device (not just DevTools)
- [ ] Test in incognito/private browsing
- [ ] Test critical user flows end-to-end
- [ ] Test with slow network (DevTools throttling)
- [ ] Check print styles (if applicable)

### S. UI Polish (Always)
- [ ] No layout shift on dynamic content (hardcoded dimensions, `tabular-nums`, no font-weight changes on hover)
- [ ] Animations have `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- [ ] Touch targets are 44px minimum
- [ ] Hover effects gated behind `@media (hover: hover)`
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works (tab order, focus trap in modals, arrow keys in lists)
- [ ] Icon-only buttons have `aria-label`
- [ ] Forms submit with Enter; textareas with ⌘/Ctrl+Enter
- [ ] Inputs are `text-base` (16px+) to prevent iOS zoom
- [ ] No `transition: all` — specify exact properties
- [ ] z-index uses fixed scale or `isolation: isolate`
- [ ] No flash on refresh for interactive state (tabs, theme, toggles)
- [ ] Destructive actions require confirmation (`AlertDialog`, not `confirm()`)

> Reference: `rules/interface/` for detailed rules on each item.

---

### Step 4: Address Gaps

For each unchecked item relevant to this project:
1. Explain what's needed and why
2. Ask the user how to proceed:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "[Explanation of what's missing and why it matters]"
  header: "Gap: [Item Name]"
  options:
    - label: "Implement it"
      description: "I'll build this now"
    - label: "Show me steps"
      description: "Provide step-by-step instructions for me to do manually"
    - label: "Skip for now"
      description: "Defer this to a follow-up task"
```

3. If "Implement it" → write the code and verify
4. If "Show me steps" → provide detailed instructions with code snippets
5. If "Skip for now" → add to tasklist as follow-up work

### Step 5: Final Verification

```bash
# Build production
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Check for issues
pnpm tsc --noEmit
pnpm biome check .

# Check bundle for secrets (manual review)
# Look for API keys, tokens, passwords in build output
```

### Step 6: Ship

If all relevant checks pass:
```bash
# Deploy via Vercel CLI
vercel --prod

# Or via git (if Vercel GitHub integration set up)
git push origin main
```

**If `vercel-deploy` skill is available:**
```
Invoke skill: vercel-deploy
```
This handles the deployment workflow with proper verification.

<tasklist_update>
If follow-up work is identified, use **TaskCreate**:
- **subject:** Brief imperative title
- **description:** What needs to be done and why
- **activeForm:** Present continuous form
</tasklist_update>

<arc_log>
**After completing this skill, append to the activity log.**
See: `${ARC_ROOT}/references/arc-log.md`

Entry: `/arc:letsgo — [Deployed to URL / Checklist complete]`
</arc_log>

<success_criteria>
Letsgo is complete when:
- [ ] Project detected and checklist tailored
- [ ] All relevant checklist items addressed or deferred with reason
- [ ] Critical items resolved (no blockers remaining)
- [ ] Production build succeeds
- [ ] Deployed to production (or ready to deploy)
- [ ] Incomplete items added to tasklist (if any)
- [ ] Progress journal updated
</success_criteria>

## Interop

- Runs **/arc:testing** as part of quality check
- Runs **/arc:audit --hygiene** as part of quality check (code artifact detection)
- References **/arc:vision** to verify alignment
- Flags missing legal documents for user to address externally
- Can invoke **vercel-react-best-practices** skill for performance review (if available)
- Can invoke **vercel-react-native-skills** skill for React Native performance review (if available)
- Can invoke **vercel-deploy** skill for deployment (if available)
