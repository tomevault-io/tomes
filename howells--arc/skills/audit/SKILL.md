# MANDATORY Tool Restrictions

## BANNED TOOLS — calling these is a skill violation:
- **`EnterPlanMode`** — BANNED. Do NOT call this tool. This skill has its own structured process. Execute the steps below directly.
- **`ExitPlanMode`** — BANNED. You are never in plan mode.
</tool_restrictions>

<tasklist_context>
**Use TaskList tool** to check for existing tasks related to this work.

If a related task exists, note its ID and mark it `in_progress` with TaskUpdate when starting.
</tasklist_context>

<required_reading>
**Read these reference files NOW:**
1. disciplines/dispatching-parallel-agents.md
2. references/audit-stage-calibration.md
</required_reading>

<progress_context>
**Use Read tool:** `docs/arc/progress.md` (first 50 lines)

Check for recent changes that should be included in audit scope.
</progress_context>

<rules_context>
**Check for project coding rules:**

**Use Glob tool:** `.ruler/*.md`

**Determine rules source:**
- **If `.ruler/` exists:** Read rules from `.ruler/`
- **If `.ruler/` doesn't exist:** Read rules from `rules/`

**Detect stack and read relevant rules from the rules source:**

| Check | Read |
|-------|------|
| Always | code-style.md, stack.md |
| `next.config.*` exists | nextjs.md |
| `react` in package.json | react.md |
| `tailwindcss` in package.json | tailwind.md |
| `.ts` or `.tsx` files | typescript.md |
| `vitest` or `jest` in package.json | testing.md |
| `drizzle` or `prisma` in package.json | api.md |
| `.env*` files exist | env.md |

Pass relevant rules to each reviewer agent.

**For each reviewer, pass domain-specific core rules:**

| Reviewer | Core Rules to Pass |
|----------|-------------------|
| security-engineer | api.md, env.md, integrations.md, auth.md (if Clerk/WorkOS), react-correctness.md (security section) |
| architecture-engineer | stack.md, turborepo.md |
| lee-nextjs-engineer | nextjs.md, api.md, react-correctness.md (Next.js-specific rules) |
| senior-engineer | code-style.md, typescript.md, react.md, error-handling.md, ai-sdk.md (if AI SDK) |
| data-engineer | testing.md, api.md |
| organization-engineer | turborepo.md, code-style.md |
| hygiene-engineer | stack.md, code-style.md, error-handling.md, ai-sdk.md (if AI SDK) |
| documentation-engineer | typescript.md, code-style.md |
| ux-writing-engineer | code-style.md |
| daniel-product-engineer | react.md, typescript.md, ai-sdk.md (if AI SDK), react-performance.md, react-correctness.md |
| performance-engineer | react-performance.md |
| seo-engineer | seo.md |

**For UI/frontend audits, also load interface rules:**

| Reviewer | Interface Rules to Pass |
|----------|------------------------|
| designer | design.md, colors.md, typography.md, marketing.md |
| daniel-product-engineer | forms.md, interactions.md, animation.md, performance.md |
| lee-nextjs-engineer | layout.md, performance.md |
| ux-writing-engineer | content-accessibility.md, marketing.md |

Interface rules location: `rules/interface/`

Pass relevant rules to each UI reviewer in their prompt. These inform what to look for, not mandates to redesign.

**UI polish checks — include in prompts for designer and daniel-product-engineer:**

In addition to their domain-specific rules, both UI reviewers should verify:
- No layout shift on dynamic content (hardcoded dimensions, `tabular-nums`, no font-weight changes on hover)
- Animations have `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- Touch targets are 44px minimum
- Hover effects gated behind `@media (hover: hover)`
- Keyboard navigation works (tab order, focus trap in modals, arrow keys in lists)
- Icon-only buttons have `aria-label`
- Forms submit with Enter; textareas with ⌘/Ctrl+Enter
- Inputs are `text-base` (16px+) to prevent iOS zoom
- No `transition: all` — specify exact properties
- z-index uses fixed scale or `isolation: isolate`
- No flash on refresh for interactive state (tabs, theme, toggles)
- Destructive actions require confirmation (`AlertDialog`, not `confirm()`)
</rules_context>

<process>
## Phase 1: Detect Scope & Project Type

**Parse arguments:**
- `$ARGUMENTS` may contain:
  - A path (e.g., `apps/web`, `packages/ui`, `src/`)
  - A focus flag (e.g., `--security`, `--performance`, `--architecture`, `--design`)
  - `--parallel` flag to run all reviewers simultaneously (resource-intensive)
  - `--diff` or `--diff [base]` flag to scope audit to only changed files vs a base branch
  - A stage override (e.g., `--stage=production`, `--stage=prototype`)
  - Combinations (e.g., `apps/web --security`, `src/ --parallel`, `--design`, `--diff develop`)

**If `--diff` flag is set:**

Determine changed files:
```bash
# Default base is main, user can override with --diff develop
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR ${base:-main}...HEAD | grep -E '\.(tsx?|jsx?|py|go|rs)$'
```

Store the file list. Pass it to every reviewer agent as a scope constraint:
```
IMPORTANT: Only review these files (changed in current branch):
[file list]

Do not flag issues in files not on this list.
```

If `--diff` produces 0 files, report "No changed files found vs [base]" and exit.

**If no scope provided:**

**Use Glob tool to detect structure:**
- `apps/*`, `packages/*` → monorepo (audit both)
- `src/*` → standard (audit src/)
- Neither → audit current directory

**Detect project type with Glob + Grep:**

| Check | Tool | Pattern |
|-------|------|---------|
| Next.js | Grep | `"next"` in `package.json` |
| React | Grep | `"react"` in `package.json` |
| Python | Glob | `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml` |
| Rust | Glob | `Cargo.toml` |
| Go | Glob | `go.mod` |

**Check for database/migrations:**

**Use Glob tool:** `prisma/*`, `drizzle/*`, `migrations/*` → has-db

**Check for AI SDK:**

**Use Grep tool:** `"ai"` in `package.json` → has-ai-sdk

If detected, run a quick deprecated API scan:
```bash
grep -rn --include='*.ts' --include='*.tsx' -E 'generateObject|maxTokens[^A-Z]|toDataStreamResponse|addToolResult|maxSteps[^A-Z]|part\.args|part\.result[^s]' src/ app/ 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

If deprecated APIs found, include count in the detection summary and flag for reviewers. These are mechanical fixes — load `rules/ai-sdk.md` and pass the migration table to the implementing agent.

**Run dependency vulnerability scan (critical/high only):**

```bash
# Node.js projects
npm audit --json 2>/dev/null | jq '[.vulnerabilities | to_entries[] | select(.value.severity == "critical" or .value.severity == "high")] | length'

# Python projects
pip-audit --format json 2>/dev/null | jq '[.[] | select(.vulns[].fix_versions)] | length'

# Or use: pnpm audit --json, yarn audit --json
```

Only surface **critical** and **high** severity vulnerabilities. Ignore moderate/low — they create noise without actionable urgency.

**Run dead code detection (JS/TS projects only):**

```bash
npx -y knip --no-progress --reporter compact 2>/dev/null | head -40
```

If knip is already a project dependency, use `npx knip` instead. Knip detects:
- Unused files (not imported anywhere)
- Unused exports (exported but never imported)
- Unused types (exported types never referenced)
- Unused dependencies (in package.json but not imported)
- Duplicate exports (same thing exported multiple ways)

Include dead code count in the detection summary. Pass findings to relevant reviewers:
- `organization-engineer` — unused files and structural dead weight
- `architecture-engineer` — unused exports indicating poor module boundaries
- `senior-engineer` — general dead code cleanup

If knip finds >20 unused exports, flag as a separate task cluster rather than distributing across reviewers.

If `--diff` flag is set, cross-reference knip results with the changed file list (knip does not support diff mode natively, so run on full project but only surface findings that touch changed files).

**Detect project scale:**

Use file counts to determine appropriate audit depth:

```bash
# Count source files (exclude node_modules, .git, dist, build)
find . -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.py" -o -name "*.go" -o -name "*.rs" \) | grep -v node_modules | grep -v .git | wc -l
```

| File Count | Scale | Audit Approach |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| < 20 files | Small | 2-3 reviewers max, skip architecture/simplicity |
| 20-100 files | Medium | 3-4 reviewers, standard audit |
| > 100 files | Large | Full reviewer suite, batched execution |

**Scale-appropriate signals:**
- Small projects: Skip `architecture-engineer` (no complex boundaries to review)
- Small projects: Skip `simplicity-engineer` (not enough code to over-engineer)
- No tests present + small project: Don't flag missing tests as critical
- Single developer: Skip `senior-engineer` (no code review discipline needed)

**Detect project lifecycle stage:**

If `--stage=<stage>` was provided in arguments, use that directly. Otherwise, infer the stage from heuristic signals:

| Signal | Tool | Indicates |
|--------|------|-----------|
| CI/CD config (`.github/workflows/*`, `Jenkinsfile`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`) | Glob | pre-launch+ |
| Deployment config (`vercel.json`, `Dockerfile`, `fly.toml`, `render.yaml`, `k8s/`) | Glob | pre-launch+ |
| Monitoring/observability (`sentry`, `datadog`, `newrelic` in deps) | Grep in package.json | production |
| Production env references (`.env.production`, `NODE_ENV` guards) | Glob + Grep | pre-launch+ |
| Test coverage > 0 (test files exist) | Glob (`**/*.test.*`, `**/*.spec.*`) | development+ |
| Git history depth | `git rev-list --count HEAD` | maturity signal |
| Custom domain / production URL in config | Grep | production |
| Rate limiting, caching, or queue deps in package.json | Grep (`rate-limit`, `redis`, `bull`) | production |

**Stage classification:**

| Stage | Description | Typical Signals |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| `prototype` | Exploring ideas, validating concepts | < 30 commits, no CI, no deploy config, no tests |
| `development` | Actively building features, not yet shipped | Has some tests, may have CI, no production deploy |
| `pre-launch` | Feature-complete, preparing to ship | Has CI, has deploy config, has tests, no monitoring |
| `production` | Live and serving real users | Has monitoring, production env, rate limiting, mature git history (200+ commits) |

Default to `development` if signals are ambiguous. When in doubt, err toward the earlier stage — it's better to under-flag than to overwhelm with premature requirements.

**Confirm stage with user:**

After detection, briefly confirm:
```
Detected project stage: [stage] (based on [key signals])
```

If the user corrects it, use their override.

**Summarize detection:**
```
Scope: [path or "full codebase"] [diff vs [base] if --diff]
Project type: [Next.js / React / Python / etc.]
Project scale: [small / medium / large]
Project stage: [prototype / development / pre-launch / production]
Has database: [yes/no]
Has AI SDK: [yes/no + deprecated API count if any]
Has tests: [yes/no]
Dead code: [X unused files, Y unused exports, Z unused deps] or "N/A (not JS/TS)"
Coding rules: [yes/no]
Focus: [all / security / performance / architecture / design]
Execution mode: [batched (default) / parallel / team]
```

## Phase 2: Select Reviewers

**Base reviewer selection by project scale:**

| Scale | Core Reviewers |
|-------|----------------|
| Small | security-engineer, performance-engineer |
| Medium | security-engineer, performance-engineer, architecture-engineer |
| Large | security-engineer, performance-engineer, architecture-engineer, organization-engineer, senior-engineer |

**Add framework-specific reviewers (medium/large only):**

| Project Type | Additional Reviewers |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Next.js | lee-nextjs-engineer, daniel-product-engineer |
| React/TypeScript | daniel-product-engineer |
| Python/Rust/Go | (none additional) |

**Conditional additions:**
- If scope includes DB/migrations → add `data-engineer`
- If monorepo with shared packages (large only) → add `simplicity-engineer`
- If project has >50 files or inconsistent structure detected → add `organization-engineer`
- If UI-heavy (React/Next.js, medium/large) → add `designer`
- If UI-heavy (React/Next.js, medium/large) → add `accessibility-engineer`
- If test files detected (medium/large) → add `test-quality-engineer`
- If recent AI-assisted work or branch audit → add `hygiene-engineer`
- If project has marketing/public pages (pre-launch/production stage) → add `seo-engineer`
- If TypeScript/JavaScript project (`.ts`/`.tsx`/`.js`/`.jsx` files, medium/large) → add `documentation-engineer`

**Focus flag overrides:**
- `--security` → only `security-engineer`
- `--performance` → only `performance-engineer`
- `--architecture` → only `architecture-engineer`
- `--organization` → only `organization-engineer`
- `--design` → only `designer`
- `--accessibility` → only `accessibility-engineer`
- `--hygiene` → only `hygiene-engineer`
- `--seo` → only `seo-engineer`
- `--docs` → only `documentation-engineer`
- `--copy` → only `ux-writing-engineer`

**Final reviewer list:**
- Small projects: 2-3 reviewers
- Medium projects: 3-4 reviewers
- Large projects: 4-6 reviewers

## Phase 2.5: Team Mode Check

<team_mode_check>
**Check if agent teams are available** by attempting to detect team support in the current environment.

**If teams are available**, offer the user a choice:

```
Execution mode:
1. Team mode — Reviewers debate findings before consolidation (higher quality, 3-5x token cost)
2. Standard mode — Independent reviewers, batched or parallel (faster, lower cost)
```

Use AskUserQuestion with:
- **"Team mode (Recommended for pre-launch/production)"** — Reviewers cross-review and challenge each other's findings. Conflicts resolved with evidence-based rationale. Best for high-stakes audits.
- **"Standard mode"** — Independent reviewers run in batches (default) or parallel (--parallel). Faster and cheaper. Findings consolidated by the skill.

**If teams are NOT available**, proceed silently with standard mode. Do not mention teams to the user.

**If team mode selected**, read the team reference:
```
references/agent-teams.md
```
</team_mode_check>

## Phase 3: Run Audit

**Read agent prompts:**
For each selected reviewer, read:
```
agents/review/[reviewer-name].md
```

**Execution strategy:**

By default, reviewers run in **batches of 2** to avoid resource exhaustion on large codebases. If `--parallel` flag is set, all reviewers run simultaneously. If user opted into **team mode**, reviewers collaborate as teammates.

### Batched Execution (Default)

Split reviewers into batches of 2. Run each batch, wait for completion, then run next batch.

**Example with 6 reviewers:**
```
Batch 1: security-engineer, performance-engineer
  → Wait for both to complete
Batch 2: architecture-engineer, daniel-product-engineer
  → Wait for both to complete
Batch 3: lee-nextjs-engineer, senior-engineer
  → Wait for both to complete
```

**Model selection per reviewer:**

| Reviewer | Model | Why |
|----------|-------|-----|
| security-engineer | sonnet | Pattern recognition + context |
| performance-engineer | sonnet | Algorithmic reasoning |
| architecture-engineer | sonnet | Structural analysis |
| organization-engineer | sonnet | File structure pattern analysis |
| daniel-product-engineer | sonnet | Code quality judgment |
| lee-nextjs-engineer | sonnet | Framework pattern recognition |
| senior-engineer | sonnet | Code review reasoning |
| simplicity-engineer | sonnet | Complexity analysis |
| data-engineer | sonnet | Data safety reasoning |
| **designer** | **opus** | **Aesthetic judgment requires premium model** |
| hygiene-engineer | sonnet | Pattern recognition for AI artifacts |
| seo-engineer | sonnet | Pattern recognition for SEO elements |
| documentation-engineer | sonnet | JSDoc coverage analysis |
| ux-writing-engineer | sonnet | UX copy quality and LLM-smell detection |

**Include project stage in every reviewer prompt.**

Each reviewer must receive the stage context so they can calibrate their severity ratings. Read the matching stage calibration block from:
```
references/audit-stage-calibration.md
```

Include in every reviewer prompt:
```
Project stage: [prototype / development / pre-launch / production]

SEVERITY CALIBRATION FOR THIS STAGE:
[Paste the matching stage block from audit-stage-calibration.md]
```

**For each batch, spawn 2 agents in parallel:**
```
Task [security-engineer] model: sonnet: "
Audit the following codebase for security issues.

Scope: [path]
Project type: [type]
Project stage: [stage]
Coding rules: [rules content if any]

[Stage calibration block from above]

Focus on: OWASP top 10, authentication/authorization, input validation, secrets handling, injection vulnerabilities.

Return findings in this format:
## Findings
### Critical
- [file:line] Issue description

### High
- [file:line] Issue description

### Medium
- [file:line] Issue description

### Low
- [file:line] Issue description

## Summary
[1-2 sentences]
"

Task [performance-engineer] model: sonnet: "
Audit the following codebase for performance issues.
[similar structure, including stage calibration block]
Focus on: N+1 queries, missing indexes, memory leaks, bundle size, render performance.
"

Task [designer] model: opus: "
Review UI implementation for visual design quality.
[similar structure, including stage calibration block]
Focus on: aesthetic direction, memorable elements, typography, color cohesion, AI slop patterns.
"
```

**Wait for batch to complete before starting next batch.**

Repeat for remaining batches:
- Batch 2: architecture-engineer + organization-engineer (if applicable)
- Batch 3: UI reviewers (daniel-product-engineer, lee-nextjs-engineer)
- Batch 4: remaining reviewers (senior-engineer, designer, data-engineer)

### Parallel Execution (--parallel flag)

Only if `--parallel` flag is explicitly set, spawn all reviewers simultaneously:

```
Task [security-engineer] model: sonnet: "..."
Task [performance-engineer] model: sonnet: "..."
Task [architecture-engineer] model: sonnet: "..."
[All additional reviewers in same message...]
```

⚠️ **Warning:** Parallel execution spawns 4-6 Claude instances simultaneously. This can cause system unresponsiveness on resource-constrained machines or large codebases.

**Wait for all agents to complete.**

### Team Execution (Agent Teams mode)

Only if user opted into team mode in Phase 2.5.

**Round 1 — Initial Analysis:**

Create team `arc-audit-[scope-slug]` with all selected reviewers as teammates. Each reviewer performs their standard analysis using the same prompts as subagent mode (including stage calibration, coding rules, and domain-specific focus areas).

```
Create team: arc-audit-[scope-slug]
Teammates: [all selected reviewers]

Each teammate runs their initial analysis independently.
Same prompts, same model selection as batched/parallel mode.
```

**Round 2 — Cross-Review:**

Each reviewer reads the others' findings and responds:
- **Confirms** findings with supporting evidence from their domain
- **Challenges** findings they believe are incorrect or overstated, citing code-level evidence
- **Reconciles** conflicting findings by synthesizing both perspectives into a resolution

```
Each teammate reviews others' Round 1 findings.
Responses: confirm (with evidence), challenge (with code citations), or reconcile (with synthesis).
```

**Resolution rules:**
- Code-level evidence wins over principle-based reasoning
- Domain authority wins within domain (security-engineer's security judgment > architecture-engineer's security opinion)
- Project stage context breaks ties
- Every challenge must include explicit rationale

**Round 2 output:** Each finding is now annotated with peer review status — confirmed, modified after challenge, or dropped with rationale.

**Wait for team to complete.**

### Structural Diff Checklist (--diff mode only)

**Skip this section if `--diff` is not active.**

After all reviewer agents complete, run an additional structural pass using the diff checklist. This catches mechanical issues (race conditions, trust boundary violations, dead code) that domain-specific reviewers may not focus on.

1. **Read the checklist:**
   ```
   Read: references/diff-review-checklist.md
   ```

2. **Get the full diff:**
   ```bash
   git diff origin/${base:-main}
   ```

3. **Apply the two-pass review** from the checklist against the diff:
   - Pass 1 (CRITICAL): Race conditions, trust boundaries, data safety
   - Pass 2 (INFORMATIONAL): Conditional side effects, stale references, test gaps, dead code, performance

4. **Merge findings** into the reviewer agent results before consolidation:
   - Checklist CRITICAL findings → treated as Critical severity
   - Checklist INFORMATIONAL findings → treated as Medium severity
   - Attribute these as "structural-checklist" in the flagged-by column
   - Deduplicate against reviewer findings (if a reviewer already flagged the same file:line, keep the reviewer's finding)

## Phase 4: Consolidate Findings

**Collect all agent outputs.**

<team_consolidation>
**If team mode was used**, consolidation is simplified — reviewers already did the hard work:

- **Deduplication: already done.** Reviewers identified overlapping findings during cross-review.
- **Conflict resolution: already done.** Contradictory findings were debated with evidence-based rationale. Each resolution includes the reasoning from both sides.
- **Severity validation: still needed.** Apply the stage-based severity calibration table below as a final sanity check.
- **Task clustering: still needed.** Group debated findings into work clusters.

Skip the deduplication and conflict resolution steps below and proceed directly to "Validate severity against project stage."
</team_consolidation>

**If standard mode was used**, proceed with full consolidation:

**Deduplicate:**
- Same file:line mentioned by multiple reviewers → merge into single finding
- Note which reviewers flagged each issue

**Validate severity against project stage:**

Use the severity validation table and conflict resolution rules from:
```
references/audit-stage-calibration.md
```

Downgrade findings that are rated higher than the stage warrants. Add note: `[Severity adjusted for [stage] stage — would be [original] in production]`

**Categorize by severity (after stage adjustment):**
1. **Critical** — Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, breaking issues
2. **High** — Performance blockers, architectural violations
3. **Medium** — Technical debt, code quality issues
4. **Low** — Suggestions, minor improvements

**Advisory tone and conflict resolution:** Follow the advisory tone guidelines and conflict resolution rules in `audit-stage-calibration.md`. Key principle: reviewers advise, user decides. Use "must fix" sparingly (security/data loss only), "should consider" for real problems, "worth noting" for suggestions.

When dismissing conflicting or irrelevant findings, include them in a collapsed "Dismissed" section with a one-line reason.

**Cluster findings into task groups:**

Do NOT group by reviewer domain (security, performance, etc.). Instead, group by **what you'd work on together** — files and concerns that would be addressed as a unit.

Clustering strategy:
1. **By area of code** — Findings touching the same files/modules cluster together regardless of which reviewer flagged them. E.g., three findings in `src/auth/` from security-engineer, performance-engineer, and architecture-engineer become one cluster: "Auth flow hardening."
2. **By type of work** — If multiple findings across different files require the same kind of change (e.g., "add error boundaries to 5 components"), cluster those together.
3. **By dependency** — If fixing finding A is a prerequisite for fixing finding B, they belong in the same cluster with A first.

Each cluster becomes a task group with:
- A descriptive name (e.g., "Auth flow hardening", "API input validation", "Dashboard performance")
- The findings it contains (with severity and file references)
- A suggested order of implementation within the cluster

Aim for 3-8 clusters. If you have more than 8, merge the smallest ones. If you have fewer than 3, that's fine — don't force artificial grouping.

## Phase 5: Generate Report

**Create audit report:**

```bash
mkdir -p docs/audits
```

File: `docs/audits/YYYY-MM-DD-[scope-slug]-audit.md`

```markdown
# Audit Report: [scope]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Reviewers:** [list of agents used]
**Scope:** [path or "full codebase"]

```

## Phase 6: Present & Offer Actions

**Show summary to user:**
```
## Audit Complete

Reviewed: [scope]
Reviewers: [count] agents
Project stage: [stage]
Report: docs/audits/YYYY-MM-DD-[scope]-audit.md

### Summary
- Critical: X | High: X | Medium: X | Low: X
- Dismissed: X (conflicts/irrelevant)
- Task clusters: X

### Task Clusters (by priority)
1. [Cluster name] — X issues (X critical, X high)
2. [Cluster name] — X issues
3. [Cluster name] — X issues
[...]
```

**Offer next steps using AskUserQuestion:**

Present these options (include all that apply):

1. **Tackle critical cluster now** → Jump straight into fixing the highest-priority cluster. Invoke `/arc:detail` scoped to the files and issues in that cluster.

2. **Write full task plan** → Write all clusters as a structured plan to `docs/arc/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-audit-tasks.md` for systematic implementation. Each cluster becomes a section with its findings, suggested approach, and a checkbox list. Commit the plan file.

3. **Add to tasks** → Use **TaskCreate** to create tasks for critical/high clusters. Each cluster becomes a task with findings in the description. Lower severity clusters are omitted — they're in the audit report if needed later.

4. **Create Linear issues** → If Linear MCP is available (`mcp__linear__*` tools exist), create Linear issues for critical/high findings. Each cluster becomes an issue with findings in the description.

5. **Deep dive on a cluster** → User picks a cluster to explore in detail. Show full findings, relevant code snippets, and discuss approach before committing to action.

5. **Done for now** → End session. Report is committed, user can return to it later.

**If user selects "Tackle critical cluster now":**
- Identify the cluster with the most critical/high findings
- Invoke `/arc:detail` with the cluster's files and issues as scope
- The detail plan will be scoped to just that cluster, not the entire audit

**If user selects "Write full task plan":**

Create `docs/arc/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-audit-tasks.md`:

```markdown
# Audit Task Plan

**Source:** docs/audits/YYYY-MM-DD-[scope]-audit.md
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Project Stage:** [stage]
**Total clusters:** X | **Total findings:** X

**Approach:** [1-2 sentences]

## Cluster 2: [Name] `[priority]`

[Same format]

---

[Repeat for all clusters]
```

Commit the plan:
```bash
git add docs/arc/plans/
git commit -m "docs: add audit task plan"
```

**If user selects "Add to tasks":**
- Use **TaskCreate** for each critical/high cluster
- Each task gets the cluster name as subject, findings as description, and present continuous activeForm
- Lower severity clusters stay in the audit report only

**If user selects "Deep dive on a cluster":**
- Ask which cluster (by number or name)
- Show the full findings with code context (read relevant files)
- Discuss the approach before taking action
- After discussion, offer to start implementing or return to the action menu

## Phase 7: Cleanup

**Kill orphaned subagent processes:**

After spawning multiple reviewer agents, some may not exit cleanly. Run cleanup to prevent memory accumulation:

```bash
scripts/cleanup-orphaned-agents.sh
```

This is especially important after `--parallel` runs or when auditing large codebases.

</process>

<arc_log>
**After completing this skill, append to the activity log.**
See: `references/arc-log.md`

Entry: `/arc:audit — [scope] ([N] critical, [N] high)`
</arc_log>

<success_criteria>
Audit is complete when:
- [ ] Scope detected (path, full codebase, or focus flag)
- [ ] Project type detected
- [ ] Execution mode determined (batched default, --parallel, or team)
- [ ] 4-6 reviewers selected based on context
- [ ] Reviewers run in batches of 2 (or all at once if --parallel)
- [ ] All reviewers completed
- [ ] Findings consolidated and deduplicated
- [ ] Report generated in `docs/audits/`
- [ ] Report committed to git
- [ ] Summary presented to user
- [ ] Next steps offered
- [ ] Progress journal updated
- [ ] Orphaned agents cleaned up (run cleanup script)
</success_criteria>
