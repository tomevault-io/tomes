# MANDATORY Tool Restrictions

## REQUIRED TOOLS — use these when indicated:
- **`AskUserQuestion`** — Preserve the one-question-at-a-time interaction pattern. In Claude Code, use the tool. In Codex, ask one concise plain-text question at a time unless a structured question tool is actually available in the current mode. Do not narrate missing tools or fallbacks to the user.
</tool_restrictions>

# /arc:go

The front door to Arc. Understands context, asks what you want to do, routes to the right workflow.

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Context (in parallel)

**Explore the codebase:**
```
Task Explore model: haiku: "Quick overview of this codebase:
- What is this project? (framework, language, purpose)
- Key directories and their purposes
- Any obvious patterns or conventions
- Is this an empty/minimal project with no framework set up?
  (e.g. just a package.json with no src/, no app framework, no pages)

Keep it brief — 5-10 bullet points max."
```

**Check for existing Arc artifacts:**
```bash
ls docs/vision.md docs/arc/specs/*.md docs/arc/plans/*.md docs/plans/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

**Check Linear (if MCP available):**
If `mcp__linear__*` tools exist, check for active issues.

**Read progress journal for recent work:**
```bash
head -50 docs/arc/progress.md 2>/dev/null
```

**Check repo staleness:**
```bash
# Last commit date (ISO format)
git log -1 --format=%ci 2>/dev/null
# Stale branches (merged or no commits in 30+ days)
git branch --list --format='%(refname:short) %(committerdate:relative)' | head -10
```

A repo is considered **stale** if the last commit was more than 2 weeks ago.

### Step 2: Present Context

Briefly share what you found:
- Project type and key patterns
- Any existing plans or tasks
- Recent work from progress journal (if found)

### Step 3: Ask What They Want to Do

Present options based on context using AskUserQuestion. Evaluate conditions in order — use the **first** that matches.

**If repo is stale (last commit > 2 weeks ago):**
```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "This repo hasn't been touched in a while (last commit: [date]). What would you like to do?"
  header: "Returning to [project name]"
  options:
    - label: "Run a health check"
      description: "Check if it builds, review outdated deps, and surface what needs attention"
    - label: "I know what I want to work on"
      description: "Skip the checkup and jump straight in"
    - label: "See suggestions"
      description: "Run /arc:suggest for ideas on what to work on"
```

**If Linear has active issues:**
```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "You have [N] active issues in Linear. What would you like to do?"
  header: "Active Issues Found"
  options:
    - label: "Work on an issue"
      description: "Pick one of the active Linear issues to work on"
    - label: "Start something new"
      description: "Ignore existing issues and start fresh"
    - label: "See suggestions"
      description: "Run /arc:suggest for ideas on what to work on"
```

**If recent plans exist:**
```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "I found a plan for [topic]. What would you like to do?"
  header: "Existing Plan Found"
  options:
    - label: "Continue that work"
      description: "Pick up where you left off on [topic]"
    - label: "Start something different"
      description: "Set the existing plan aside and work on something new"
```

**If empty/minimal codebase (no framework detected):**
```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "This project doesn't have a framework set up yet. What would you like to do?"
  header: "Empty Project"
  options:
    - label: "Set up a new project"
      description: "Scaffold a framework (Next.js, etc.) and get started"
    - label: "Define a vision first"
      description: "Run /arc:vision to clarify project goals before building"
    - label: "I know what I want to build"
      description: "Describe the feature and jump straight in"
```

**If fresh codebase (has framework but no Arc artifacts):**
```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What would you like to work on?"
  header: "Ready to Go"
  options:
    - label: "Build a feature"
      description: "Describe a feature or change you want to make"
    - label: "Fix a bug"
      description: "Describe the bug you want to fix"
    - label: "Explore what needs work"
      description: "Run /arc:suggest to discover what could be improved"
```

### Step 3.5: Scope Posture (feature work only)

**Skip this step** if the user's intent is a quick fix, continuing an existing plan, running tests, shipping, or reviewing code. Only ask when routing to `/arc:ideate` or `/arc:build` for a new feature.

Ask one question:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "How should I approach this?"
  header: "Scope Posture"
  options:
    - label: "Expand"
      description: "Find the bigger product hiding inside this. Push the ambition up."
    - label: "Reduce"
      description: "Find the minimum viable version. Strip everything else."
    - label: "Just build what I described"
      description: "Take the request as-is, no scope change. (Default if you skip this.)"
```

Pass the chosen posture as context when invoking the downstream skill:
```
Skill arc:[chosen]: "[user's description] [Posture: expand|reduce|as-described]"
```

**Rules:**
- If the user doesn't engage with the question or says something like "just do it", default to **as-described** and move on. Don't slow them down.
- Never ask this for small changes, bug fixes, or continuation of existing work.

### Step 4: Route to Workflow

Based on their answer:

| Intent | Route to |
|--------|----------|
| "Run a health check" | Health check flow (see below) |
| "Set up a new project" | /arc:build with scaffolding context |
| "I want to build [feature]" | /arc:ideate (with posture from Step 3.5) |
| "Quick fix/small change" | /arc:build |
| "Continue [existing plan]" | /arc:implement |
| "Not sure what to work on" | /arc:suggest |
| "Review/improve existing code" | /arc:audit or /arc:review |
| "Make it responsive/fix mobile" | /arc:responsive |
| "Ship to production" | /arc:letsgo |
| "Run tests" | /arc:testing |

**Invoke the skill:**
```
Skill arc:[chosen]: "[user's description]"
```

#### Health Check Flow

When the user picks "Run a health check", run these sequentially — stop and report if anything critical fails:

1. **Verify the build** — `Skill arc:verify: "quick"`
   - Does it build? Typecheck? Lint? Tests pass?
   - If critical failures, report them and ask if the user wants to fix before continuing.

2. **Check dependencies** — `Skill arc:deps`
   - Outdated packages, known CVEs, major version bumps available.
   - Present the deps report but don't auto-apply upgrades.

3. **Surface what needs attention** — `Skill arc:suggest`
   - TODOs, technical debt, stale plans, vision gaps.
   - Gives the user a prioritized list of what to tackle.

After all three, summarize:

```markdown
## Health Check Summary

**Build:** [passing / failing — brief detail if failing]
**Dependencies:** [N outdated, N with CVEs — or "all current"]
**What needs attention:** [top 2-3 items from suggest]
```

Then ask:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What would you like to tackle?"
  header: "Health Check Complete"
  options:
    - label: "[Top suggestion from results]"
      description: "[Brief rationale]"
    - label: "[Second suggestion]"
      description: "[Brief rationale]"
    - label: "Something else"
      description: "Tell me what you want to work on"
```

## What /arc:go is NOT

- Not a replacement for specific commands — it routes TO them
- Not for when you already know what command to use

## Interop

- Routes to all other /arc:* commands
- Reads Linear issues (if MCP available), /arc:vision, progress for context
- Uses /arc:suggest when user is unsure
- Chains /arc:verify → /arc:deps → /arc:suggest for stale repo health checks
