# MANDATORY Tool Restrictions

## REQUIRED TOOLS — use these when indicated:
- **`AskUserQuestion`** — Preserve the one-question-at-a-time interaction pattern. In Claude Code, use the tool. In Codex, ask one concise plain-text question at a time unless a structured question tool is actually available in the current mode. Do not narrate missing tools or fallbacks to the user.

## BANNED TOOLS — calling these is a skill violation:
- **`EnterPlanMode`** — BANNED. Do NOT call this tool. This skill has its own structured testing workflow. Execute it directly.
- **`ExitPlanMode`** — BANNED. You are never in plan mode.
</tool_restrictions>

<arc_runtime>
This workflow requires the full Arc bundle, not a prompts-only install.
Resolve the Arc install root from this skill's location and refer to it as `${ARC_ROOT}`.
Use `${ARC_ROOT}/...` for Arc-owned files such as `references/`, `disciplines/`, `agents/`, `templates/`, and `scripts/`.
Use project-local paths such as `.ruler/` or `rules/` for the user's repository.
</arc_runtime>

# Testing Strategy Workflow

Create comprehensive test strategies covering the full test pyramid. Execute with specialist agents.

<required_reading>
**Read before planning:**
1. `${ARC_ROOT}/references/testing-patterns.md` — Test philosophy, vitest/playwright patterns
2. `rules/testing.md` — Project conventions
3. `${ARC_ROOT}/references/llm-api-testing.md` — If testing LLM integrations
4. `${ARC_ROOT}/disciplines/change-impact-testing.md` — Blast radius analysis for code changes
</required_reading>

## Agents

**This skill uses 3 writers + 2 runners:**

| Agent | Model | Purpose | Framework |
|-------|-------|---------|-----------|
| `unit-test-writer` | sonnet | Write unit tests | vitest |
| `integration-test-writer` | sonnet | Write integration tests (API, auth) | vitest + MSW |
| `e2e-test-writer` | opus | Write E2E tests | Playwright |
| `test-runner` | haiku | Run vitest, analyze failures | vitest |
| `e2e-runner` | opus | Run Playwright, fix issues, iterate | Playwright |

**Test Pyramid:**
```
         /\
        /  \       E2E (few)
       /────\      - Critical user journeys
      /      \     - Auth flows
     /────────\    Integration (some)
    /          \   - API interactions
   /────────────\  - Component + state
  /              \ Unit (many)
 /────────────────\- Pure functions
                   - Isolated components
```

<rules_context>
**Check for project testing rules:**

**Use Glob tool:** `.ruler/testing.md`

If exists, read for MUST/SHOULD/NEVER constraints.

**Detect test framework:**

| File | Framework |
|------|-----------|
| `vitest.config.*` | vitest (unit + integration) |
| `playwright.config.*` | Playwright (E2E) |
</rules_context>

## Process

### Step 1: Determine Intent

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What would you like to do?"
  header: "Testing Intent"
  options:
    - label: "Create test strategy"
      description: "Full test plan across unit, integration, and E2E — then dispatch agents"
    - label: "Run tests"
      description: "Execute existing tests with the appropriate runner"
    - label: "Fix failing tests"
      description: "Dispatch debugger or e2e-runner to fix broken tests"
    - label: "Review coverage"
      description: "Analyze gaps in test coverage and recommend improvements"
```

### Step 2: Understand What's Being Tested

Gather context:
1. What feature or component?
2. Does it have auth? (Clerk, WorkOS, custom)
3. Does it call APIs?
4. Does it have critical user flows?
5. What's the risk level?

### Step 3: Create Test Plan

**For each feature, plan across all levels:**

```markdown
## Test Plan: [Feature Name]

### Risk Assessment
- **Criticality**: [high/medium/low]
- **Has Auth**: [yes/no — Clerk/WorkOS/custom]
- **Has API Calls**: [yes/no]
- **User-Facing**: [yes/no]

### Unit Tests (vitest)
**Agent:** unit-test-writer

| Test Case | What it Verifies |
|-----------|------------------|
| `should [behavior]` | [Pure function/component behavior] |
| `should [behavior]` | [Edge case handling] |
| `should [behavior]` | [Error throwing] |

**Files to create:**
- `src/[path]/[module].test.ts`

### Integration Tests (vitest + MSW)
**Agent:** integration-test-writer

| Test Case | What it Verifies |
|-----------|------------------|
| `should [behavior]` | [Component + API interaction] |
| `should [behavior]` | [Auth state handling] |
| `should [behavior]` | [Error from API] |

**Mocking required:**
- API endpoints: [list]
- Auth: [Clerk/WorkOS mock setup]

**Files to create:**
- `src/[path]/[feature].integration.test.ts`

### E2E Tests (Playwright)
**Agent:** e2e-test-writer

| Test Case | What it Verifies |
|-----------|------------------|
| `should [complete flow]` | [Happy path journey] |
| `should [handle error]` | [User-visible error] |
| `should [auth flow]` | [Login/logout if applicable] |

**Auth setup required:**
- Provider: [Clerk/WorkOS/none]
- Test user: [env var names]

**Files to create:**
- `tests/[feature].spec.ts`
- `tests/auth.setup.ts` (if auth needed)
```

### Step 4: Execute Test Plan

Dispatch specialists in order:

**1. Unit tests first (fastest feedback):**
```
Task [unit-test-writer] model: sonnet: "Write unit tests for [feature].

Test cases from plan:
[paste unit test cases]

Files to create: [paths]
Follow vitest patterns from testing-patterns.md"
```

**2. Integration tests second:**
```
Task [integration-test-writer] model: sonnet: "Write integration tests for [feature].

Test cases from plan:
[paste integration test cases]

Auth: [Clerk/WorkOS/none]
API mocking: [endpoints to mock]
Files to create: [paths]"
```

**3. E2E tests last:**
```
Task [e2e-test-writer] model: opus: "Write E2E tests for [feature].

Test cases from plan:
[paste e2e test cases]

Auth: [Clerk/WorkOS/none]
Fixtures needed: [list]
Files to create: [paths]"
```

### Step 5: Run and Verify

**Unit + Integration (inline):**
```bash
pnpm vitest run
```

**E2E (background agent — avoids terminal issues):**
```
Task [e2e-runner] model: opus: "Run E2E tests and fix any failures.

Test files: [list]
Iterate until green or report blockers."
```

## Auth Testing Quick Reference

### Clerk Testing

**Integration tests (vitest):**
- Mock `useAuth` and `useUser` hooks
- Test loading, signed in, signed out states
- Mock `getToken` for API calls

**E2E tests (Playwright):**
- Create `tests/auth.setup.ts` for login flow
- Store session in `playwright/.auth/user.json`
- Use `storageState` in playwright.config.ts

**Common issues:**
- ❌ Trying to mock ClerkProvider (mock hooks instead)
- ❌ Not handling `isLoaded: false` state
- ❌ Hardcoding tokens (use `getToken` mock)

### WorkOS Testing

**Integration tests (vitest):**
- Mock `getUser` from `@workos-inc/authkit-nextjs`
- Test with full user object including `organizationId`, `role`, `permissions`
- Test SSO redirect behavior

**E2E tests (Playwright):**
- SSO flows are slow — consider test bypass endpoint
- Create `/api/auth/test-login` for faster auth (test env only)
- Store session state after auth

**Common issues:**
- ❌ Forgetting `organizationId` in mock (required for org-level features)
- ❌ Not testing permission checks
- ❌ SSO redirect timing issues (add proper waits)

### Bypass Auth for Speed

For faster E2E tests, create a test-only auth endpoint:

```typescript
// app/api/auth/test-login/route.ts
// ONLY available in test/development
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
    return new Response("Not found", { status: 404 });
  }
  // Create session directly without SSO flow
}
```

## Test Patterns

### What to Test at Each Level

| Level | Test | Don't Test |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Unit** | Pure functions, isolated components, hooks | API calls, multi-component flows |
| **Integration** | Component + API, auth states, form submissions | Full user journeys |
| **E2E** | Critical paths, auth flows, checkout/signup | Every possible input |

### Coverage Guidelines

| Feature Type | Unit | Integration | E2E |
|--------------|------|-------------|-----|
| Utility functions | ✅ heavy | ❌ none | ❌ none |
| UI components | ✅ rendering | ✅ with state | ❌ only if critical |
| Forms | ✅ validation | ✅ submission | ✅ critical forms |
| API routes | ✅ handlers | ✅ with mocking | ❌ via E2E |
| Auth flows | ❌ none | ✅ mock states | ✅ real flow |
| Checkout/payment | ✅ calculations | ✅ flow | ✅ full journey |

### Fail-Fast Configuration

**Tests must fail fast. Never:**
- Global timeout of minutes
- 5+ retries to mask flakiness
- Arbitrary sleeps

**Playwright config:**
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  timeout: 30_000,        // 30s max per test
  expect: {
    timeout: 5_000,       // 5s for assertions
  },
  use: {
    actionTimeout: 10_000, // 10s per action
  },
});
```

After creating test strategy or running tests:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — /arc:testing
**Task:** [Create strategy / Run tests / Fix failing]
**Feature:** [What was tested]
**Coverage:**
- Unit: [N] tests
- Integration: [N] tests
- E2E: [N] tests
**Auth:** [Clerk/WorkOS/none]
**Result:** [All passing / X failing]
**Next:** [Fix failures / Done]

---
```
</progress_append>
