# MANDATORY Tool Restrictions

## BANNED TOOLS — calling these is a skill violation:
- **`EnterPlanMode`** — BANNED. Do NOT call this tool. This skill has its own structured process. Execute the steps below directly.
- **`ExitPlanMode`** — BANNED. You are never in plan mode.
</tool_restrictions>

<arc_runtime>
This workflow requires the full Arc bundle, not a prompts-only install.
Resolve the Arc install root from this skill's location and refer to it as `${ARC_ROOT}`.
Use `${ARC_ROOT}/...` for Arc-owned files such as `references/`, `disciplines/`, `agents/`, `templates/`, and `scripts/`.
Use project-local paths such as `.ruler/` or `rules/` for the user's repository.
</arc_runtime>

<required_reading>
**Read these reference files NOW:**
1. ${ARC_ROOT}/references/review-patterns.md
2. ${ARC_ROOT}/disciplines/dispatching-parallel-agents.md
3. ${ARC_ROOT}/disciplines/receiving-code-review.md
</required_reading>

<rules_context>
**Check for project coding rules:**

**Use Glob tool:** `.ruler/*.md`

**Determine rules source:**
- **If `.ruler/` exists:** Read rules from `.ruler/`
- **If `.ruler/` doesn't exist:** Read rules from `rules/`

**Pass relevant core rules to each reviewer:**

| Reviewer | Rules to Pass |
|----------|--------------|
| daniel-product-engineer | react.md, typescript.md, code-style.md |
| lee-nextjs-engineer | nextjs.md, api.md |
| senior-engineer | code-style.md, typescript.md, react.md |
| architecture-engineer | stack.md, turborepo.md |
| security-engineer | security.md, api.md, env.md |
| data-engineer | database.md, testing.md, api.md |
| senior-engineer | cloudflare-workers.md (if wrangler.toml exists) |
| accessibility-engineer | (interface rules only — already in agent prompt) |
| designer | design.md, colors.md, spacing.md, typography.md |
</rules_context>

<progress_context>
**Use Read tool:** `docs/arc/progress.md` (first 50 lines)

Check for context on what led to the plan being reviewed.
</progress_context>

<scope_discipline>
## Scope Discipline

Reviewers must respect the plan's scope. This is non-negotiable:

- **Do not silently argue for less work.** If you think the plan is overbuilt, raise it once in a "Scope Check" early in the review. After the user responds, commit to their decision.
- **Do not sneak in additional scope.** Don't suggest features, enhancements, or "while you're at it" additions beyond what the plan covers.
- **Your job is to make this plan succeed, not to lobby for a different plan.** Once scope is agreed, optimize within it — find bugs, catch edge cases, improve the architecture — but don't re-litigate what gets built.
- **Include this principle in every reviewer prompt:** "Respect the plan's scope. Flag scope concerns once, then commit to making the plan succeed."
</scope_discipline>

<process>
## Phase 0: Check for Specific Reviewer or Diff Mode

**If `--diff` argument provided:**
- Switch to **diff review mode** — skip Phase 1 (plan search) entirely
- Jump to Phase 1D (Diff Review) below

**If argument provided** (e.g., `daniel-product-engineer`):
- Look for `${ARC_ROOT}/agents/review/{argument}.md`
- If found → use only this reviewer, skip Phase 2 detection
- If not found → list available reviewers from `${ARC_ROOT}/agents/review/` and ask user to pick

**Available reviewers:**
- `daniel-product-engineer` — Type safety, UI completeness, React patterns
- `lee-nextjs-engineer` — Next.js App Router, server-first architecture
- `senior-engineer` — Asymmetric strictness, review discipline
- `architecture-engineer` — System design, component boundaries
- `performance-engineer` — Bottlenecks, scalability
- `security-engineer` — Vulnerabilities, OWASP
- `data-engineer` — Migrations, transactions
- `designer` — Visual design quality, UX fundamentals, AI slop detection

## Phase 1: Find the Plan

**Check if plan file path provided as argument:**
- If yes → read that file and proceed to Phase 2
- If no → search for plans

**Search strategy:**

1. **Check conversation context first** — Look for Claude Code plan mode output
   - Look back through recent conversation messages
   - Search for plan structure markers:
     - "# Plan" or "## Plan" headings
     - "Implementation Steps" sections
     - Task lists with implementation details
     - Step-by-step procedures
   - If found → extract the plan content and proceed to Phase 2

2. **Search Arc plan folders** — Look for plan files

   **Use Glob tool:** `docs/arc/plans/*.md`
   **Fallback:** `docs/plans/*.md`

   - Sort results by modification time (newest first)
   - Show all plan files (design, implementation, etc.)

3. **Present options if multiple found:**
   - List up to 5 most recent plans
   - Show: filename, modification date, brief preview
   - Ask user: "Which plan should I review?"

4. **If no plans found:**
   - Check if the current branch has changes vs main:
     ```bash
     git fetch origin main --quiet && git diff origin/main --stat
     ```
   - **If branch has changes:** Offer to review the diff instead:
     "No plans found, but this branch has changes against main. Want me to review the diff?"
     - If yes → switch to Phase 1D (Diff Review)
     - If no → "Can you point me to a plan file, or paste the plan you'd like me to review?"
   - **If no changes:** "I couldn't find any plans or branch changes to review."

**Once plan located:**
- Store the plan content
- Note the source (conversation, file path, or user-provided)
- Proceed to Phase 2

## Phase 1D: Diff Review

**This phase runs instead of plan review** when `--diff` is passed or the user opts into diff review from Phase 1.

1. **Check branch state:**
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```
   If on `main` with no changes: "Nothing to review — you're on main with no changes." Stop.

2. **Read the checklist:**
   ```
   Read: ${ARC_ROOT}/references/diff-review-checklist.md
   ```

3. **Get the diff:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin main --quiet
   git diff origin/main
   ```

4. **Run two-pass review** applying the checklist against the diff:
   - **Pass 1 (CRITICAL):** Race conditions, trust boundaries, data safety
   - **Pass 2 (INFORMATIONAL):** Conditional side effects, stale references, test gaps, dead code, performance

5. **Present findings** using the checklist's output format.

6. **If CRITICAL issues found:** For each critical issue, present as a Socratic question:
   - "This pattern reads then writes without a transaction — what happens if two requests hit this simultaneously?"
   - Wait for user to decide: fix now, acknowledge, or mark as false positive

7. **Skip to Phase 6** (Summary and Next Steps) — diff review doesn't need the full plan review pipeline.

## Phase 2: Detect Project Type

**Skip if specific reviewer provided in Phase 0.**

**Detect project type for reviewer selection:**

**Use Grep tool on `package.json`:**
- Pattern: `"next"` → nextjs
- Pattern: `"react"` → react

**Use Glob tool:**
- `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml` → python

**Select reviewers based on project type:**

**TypeScript/React:**
- ${ARC_ROOT}/agents/review/daniel-product-engineer.md
- ${ARC_ROOT}/agents/review/senior-engineer.md
- ${ARC_ROOT}/agents/review/architecture-engineer.md

**Next.js:**
- ${ARC_ROOT}/agents/review/lee-nextjs-engineer.md
- ${ARC_ROOT}/agents/review/daniel-product-engineer.md
- ${ARC_ROOT}/agents/review/senior-engineer.md

**Python:**
- ${ARC_ROOT}/agents/review/senior-engineer.md
- ${ARC_ROOT}/agents/review/performance-engineer.md
- ${ARC_ROOT}/agents/review/architecture-engineer.md

**General/Unknown:**
- ${ARC_ROOT}/agents/review/senior-engineer.md
- ${ARC_ROOT}/agents/review/architecture-engineer.md

**Conditional addition (all UI project types):**
- If plan involves UI components, forms, or user-facing features → add `${ARC_ROOT}/agents/review/accessibility-engineer.md`
- If plan involves UI components, pages, or visual design → add `${ARC_ROOT}/agents/review/designer.md`

## Phase 2.5: Team Mode Check

<team_mode_check>
**Skip if specific reviewer was provided in Phase 0** (single reviewer, no team needed).

**Check if agent teams are available** by attempting to detect team support in the current environment.

**If teams are available**, offer the user a choice:

```
Execution mode:
1. Team mode — Reviewers challenge each other's findings before you see them (higher quality, 3-5x token cost)
2. Standard mode — Independent reviewers, findings consolidated by skill (faster, lower cost)
```

Use the AskUserQuestion interaction pattern with:
- **"Team mode"** — Reviewers cross-review and debate findings. Questions that survive peer scrutiny are stronger. Best when reviewing complex or high-stakes plans.
- **"Standard mode (Recommended)"** — Independent reviewers run in parallel. Faster and cheaper. Good default for most reviews.

**If teams are NOT available**, proceed silently with standard mode. Do not mention teams to the user.

**If team mode selected**, read the team reference:
```
${ARC_ROOT}/references/agent-teams.md
```
</team_mode_check>

## Phase 3: Run Expert Review

**If specific reviewer from Phase 0:** Spawn single reviewer agent.

**If team mode selected:** Run team review (see Team Execution below).

**Otherwise:** Spawn 3 reviewer agents in parallel:

```
Task [reviewer-1] model: sonnet: "Review this plan for [specialty concerns].
Plan:
[plan content]

Focus on: [specific area based on reviewer type]"

Task [reviewer-2] model: sonnet: "Review this plan for [specialty concerns]..."

Task [reviewer-3] model: sonnet: "Review this plan for [specialty concerns]..."
```

### Team Execution (Agent Teams mode)

Only if user opted into team mode in Phase 2.5.

Create team `arc-review-[plan-slug]` with the 3 selected reviewers as teammates.

**Round 1 — Initial Review:**

Each reviewer performs their standard analysis independently (same prompts as standard mode).

```
Create team: arc-review-[plan-slug]
Teammates: [reviewer-1], [reviewer-2], [reviewer-3]

Each teammate reviews the plan through their domain lens.
Same prompts and focus areas as standard mode.
```

**Round 2 — Cross-Review:**

Each reviewer reads the others' findings and responds:
- **"My analysis supports this"** — Confirms another reviewer's concern with additional evidence
- **"My analysis addresses that"** — Points out that their recommendation already handles the concern
- **"I disagree because"** — Challenges a finding with code-level evidence or domain reasoning

**Resolution rules (from agent-teams reference):**
- Code-level evidence wins over principle-based reasoning
- Domain authority wins within domain
- Every challenge must include explicit rationale

**Round 2 output:** Pre-debated findings where each concern has either been confirmed by peers, refined through challenge, or dropped with stated rationale.

**Wait for team to complete.**

**If team creation fails**, fall back silently to standard parallel dispatch above.

## Phase 4: Consolidate and Present

<team_consolidation>
**If team mode was used**, consolidation is simpler:

- Findings already survived peer scrutiny — false positives were caught and removed during debate
- Conflicting recommendations already resolved with rationale from both sides
- Socratic questions derived from team-debated findings carry more weight: "Two reviewers independently flagged this — what if we..."
- Focus on transforming debated findings into questions (skip deduplication and conflict resolution)
</team_consolidation>

**Transform findings into Socratic questions:**

See `${ARC_ROOT}/references/review-patterns.md` for approach.

Instead of presenting critiques:
- Turn findings into exploratory questions
- "What if we..." not "You should..."
- Collaborative spirit, not adversarial

**Example transformations:**
- Reviewer: "This is overengineered"
  → "We have three layers here. What if we started with one?"
- Reviewer: "Missing error handling"
  → "What happens if the API call fails? Should we handle that now or later?"
- Reviewer: "Security concern"
  → "This stores the token in localStorage. Is that acceptable for this use case?"

**Present questions one at a time:**
- Wait for user response
- If user wants to keep something, they probably have context
- Track decisions as you go

## Phase 5: Apply Decisions

For each decision:
- Note what was changed
- Note what was kept and why

If plan came from a file:
- Update the file with changes
- Commit: `git commit -m "docs: update <plan> based on review"`

## Phase 6: Summary and Next Steps

```markdown
## Review Summary

**Reviewed:** [plan name/source]
**Reviewers:** [list]

### Changes Made
- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]

### Kept As-Is
- [Decision 1]: [reason]

### Open Questions
- [Any unresolved items]
```

**Show remaining arc:**
```
/arc:ideate     → Design doc (on main) ✓
     ↓
/arc:review     → Review ✓ YOU ARE HERE
     ↓
/arc:implement  → Plan + Execute task-by-task
```

**Offer next steps based on what was reviewed:**

If reviewed a **design doc**:
- "Ready to implement?" → `/arc:implement` (which will create the plan internally)
- "Done for now" → end

If reviewed an **implementation plan**:
- "Ready to implement?" → `/arc:implement`
- "Done for now" → end

## Phase 7: Cleanup

**Kill orphaned subagent processes:**

After spawning reviewer agents, some may not exit cleanly. Run cleanup:

```bash
${ARC_ROOT}/scripts/cleanup-orphaned-agents.sh
```

</process>

<arc_log>
**After completing this skill, append to the activity log.**
See: `${ARC_ROOT}/references/arc-log.md`

Entry: `/arc:review — [Plan name] reviewed`
</arc_log>
