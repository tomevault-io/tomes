<arc_runtime>
Arc-owned files live under the Arc install root for full-runtime installs.

Set `${ARC_ROOT}` to that root and use `${ARC_ROOT}/...` for Arc bundle files such as
`references/`, `disciplines/`, `agents/`, `templates/`, `scripts/`, and `rules/`.

Project-local files stay relative to the user's repository.

<arc_log>
**Use Read tool:** `.arc/log.md` (first 50 lines)

Check what was recently worked on to avoid re-suggesting completed work.

# Suggest Workflow

Analyze Linear issues, tasks, codebase, and vision to give opinionated recommendations for what to work on next.

## Priority Cascade

1. **Linear issues** (highest priority, if MCP available) — Already triaged, most immediate
2. **Existing tasks** — Already noted, pending action
3. **Codebase issues** — Technical debt, gaps, patterns
4. **Vision gaps** — Goals not yet implemented
5. **Discovery** (lowest priority, opt-in) — New feature ideas from external research

## Process

### Step 1: Check Linear (if available)

**Check for Linear MCP:**
Look for `mcp__linear__*` tools in available tools.

**If Linear MCP available:**
```
mcp__linear__list_issues: { filter: { state: { type: { in: ["started", "unstarted"] } } }, first: 10 }
```

Prioritize issues marked as high priority or in current cycle.

**If Linear not available:** Check TaskList.

### Step 1b: Check Tasks

**Use TaskList tool** to check for existing tasks.

If tasks exist with status `pending`:
→ Recommend those first with brief rationale

### Step 2: Analyze Codebase

**Use Task tool to spawn exploration agent:**
```
Task Explore model: haiku: "Analyze this codebase for:
- Incomplete features (TODOs, FIXMEs)
- Technical debt (outdated patterns, missing tests)
- Quality issues (type escapes, inconsistencies)
- Missing documentation
- Performance concerns

Prioritize by impact."
```

### Step 3: Read Vision (if needed)

Only if no Linear issues/tasks exist AND codebase analysis found nothing urgent:

**Use Read tool:** `docs/vision.md`

Compare vision goals to current state. Identify gaps.

### Step 4: Synthesize Recommendations

Present top 3-5 suggestions:

```markdown
## Suggestions

### 1. [Top recommendation]
**Why:** [Brief rationale]
**Command:** /arc:ideate [topic]

### 2. [Second recommendation]
**Why:** [Brief rationale]
**Command:** [relevant command]

### 3. [Third recommendation]
**Why:** [Brief rationale]
**Command:** [relevant command]
```

### Step 5: Offer to Act

"Want me to dive deeper into any of these with `/arc:ideate`?"

If user picks one, invoke the relevant command.

## Suggestion Categories

**From Linear:**
- "High priority: [issue title] — ready to tackle it?"
- "Current cycle has [N] issues — start with [X]?"

**From Tasks:**
- "You noted [X] — ready to tackle it?"

**From Codebase:**
- "Found [N] TODOs in [area] — want to address them?"
- "Test coverage is thin in [area]"
- "Outdated pattern in [file] — could modernize"

**From Vision:**
- "Vision mentions [goal] but I don't see it implemented"
- "Vision says [X] is a non-goal but code does [X]"

**From Discovery:**
- "Competitors in [space] are adding [feature] — your architecture already supports it"
- "[Emerging tech] could unlock [capability] with [effort level] effort"
- "Revenue opportunity: [strategy] is trending in [domain] and fits your stack"

## What Suggest is NOT

- Not a code review (use /arc:audit or /arc:review)
- Not a test runner (use /arc:testing)
- Not a planner (use /arc:ideate)

It's a compass, not a map. Discovery mode just points the compass outward.
