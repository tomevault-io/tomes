# MANDATORY Tool Restrictions

## REQUIRED TOOLS — use these, do not skip:
- **`AskUserQuestion`** — Preserve the one-question-at-a-time interaction pattern for user decisions such as update confirmation and Ruler offers. In Claude Code, use the tool. In Codex, ask one concise plain-text question at a time unless a structured question tool is actually available in the current mode. Do not narrate missing tools or fallbacks to the user.

## BANNED TOOLS — calling these is a skill violation:
- **`EnterPlanMode`** — BANNED. Do NOT call this tool. This skill has its own structured process. Execute the steps below directly.
- **`ExitPlanMode`** — BANNED. You are never in plan mode.
</tool_restrictions>

<arc_runtime>
Arc-owned files live under the Arc install root for full-runtime installs.

Set `${ARC_ROOT}` to that root and use `${ARC_ROOT}/...` for Arc bundle files such as
`references/`, `disciplines/`, `agents/`, `templates/`, `scripts/`, and `rules/`.

Project-local files stay relative to the user's repository.
</arc_runtime>

```

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Apply Arc's coding standards to the current project.

<process>

## Step 1: Check for existing rules

**Use Glob tool:** `.ruler/*.md`

**If `.ruler/` does not exist:** Go to Step 2 (Fresh Install)

**If `.ruler/` exists:** Go to Step 3 (Update Flow)

## Step 2: Fresh Install

Resolve the Arc install root from this skill's location and refer to it as `${ARC_ROOT}` for the rest of this workflow.

Copy all rules from Arc to the project:

```bash
cp -r "${ARC_ROOT}/rules/" .ruler/
```

Tell the user:
```
Rules copied to .ruler/

Files added:
- stack.md, api.md, ai-sdk.md, cli.md, code-style.md, env.md, git.md, integrations.md, tooling.md
- nextjs.md, react.md, tailwind.md, testing.md
- turborepo.md, typescript.md, versions.md
- interface/ (animation, design, forms, interactions, layout, performance, typography)
```

Go to Step 4 (Offer Ruler)

## Step 3: Update Flow

Existing `.ruler/` found. Ask the user:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Found existing .ruler/ in this project. Update with Arc's latest rules? This will backup current rules and overwrite with Arc's latest. You can review changes with `git diff .ruler/` after."
  header: "Update Rules"
  options:
    - label: "Update rules"
      description: "Backup current rules to .ruler.backup-TIMESTAMP/ and overwrite with Arc's latest"
    - label: "Keep existing"
      description: "Keep your current rules unchanged"
```

**If user picks "Update rules":**
```bash
# Create backup
cp -r .ruler/ ".ruler.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)/"

# Copy fresh rules
rm -rf .ruler/
cp -r "${ARC_ROOT}/rules/" .ruler/
```

Tell the user:
```
Rules updated. Backup saved to .ruler.backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS/

Review changes with: git diff .ruler/
```

Go to Step 4 (Offer Ruler)

**If user picks "Keep existing":**
```
Keeping existing rules. You can manually compare with Arc's rules at:
${ARC_ROOT}/rules/
```

Done.

## Step 4: Offer Ruler

Ask the user:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Want to distribute rules to other AI agents (Copilot, Cursor, etc.) via Ruler?"
  header: "Distribute Rules"
  options:
    - label: "Run ruler apply"
      description: "Run npx ruler apply to distribute rules to other AI tools"
    - label: "Skip"
      description: "Keep rules in .ruler/ only, distribute later if needed"
```

**If user picks "Run ruler apply":**
```bash
npx ruler apply
```

If ruler is not installed (command fails):
```
Ruler not found. Rules are in .ruler/ and ready for use.

To distribute to other AI agents, install ruler:
  npm install -g ruler

Then run:
  npx ruler apply
```

**If user picks "Skip":**
```
Rules are ready in .ruler/. Run `npx ruler apply` later if you want to distribute to other agents.
```

## Step 5: Suggest Linear (for complex projects)

After rules are set up, check project complexity:

```bash
# Count source files
find . -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" \) | grep -v node_modules | wc -l
```

**If >50 files or monorepo detected:**
```
This looks like a complex project. Consider setting up Linear MCP for issue tracking:

1. Add to .mcp.json:
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "linear": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@anthropic/linear-mcp"]
       }
     }
   }

2. Arc will then:
   - Query active issues in /arc:suggest
   - Create issues from /arc:audit findings
   - Link work to issues for context

See .ruler/tooling.md for details.
```

**If small project:** Skip this suggestion.

Done.

</process>

<notes>
- Rules are copied, not symlinked, so projects can customize
- Backup ensures user customizations are never lost
- Ruler is optional — Arc works without it
- After copying, rules are immediately available to Arc skills that read from `.ruler/`
