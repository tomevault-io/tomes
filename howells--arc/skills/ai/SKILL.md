# MANDATORY Tool Restrictions

## BANNED TOOLS — calling these is a skill violation:
- **`EnterPlanMode`** — BANNED. Do NOT call this tool. This skill has its own structured process. Execute the steps below directly.
- **`ExitPlanMode`** — BANNED. You are never in plan mode.

AI SDK 6 guidance for building AI-powered features.

<required_reading>
**Read after detecting AI SDK (Step 1):**
1. references/ai-sdk.md — Patterns and code examples
2. rules/ai-sdk.md — MUST/NEVER constraints
</required_reading>

<process>

## Step 1: Detect AI SDK

**Check package.json for AI SDK:**

```bash
grep -E '"ai"' package.json
```

**If not found:**
```
AI SDK (`ai` package) not found in this project.

1. Install it — `pnpm add ai @ai-sdk/react @openrouter/ai-sdk-provider`
2. Skip — I'll explain the patterns without a project context
```

Wait for user choice. If install, run the command and continue.

**If found, extract version:**
```bash
grep -A1 '"ai"' package.json | grep -oE '[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+'
```

**If version < 6:**
```
⚠ AI SDK version [version] detected. Version 6 has breaking changes that affect
almost every API. The patterns I'll load are for v6+.

If you're migrating, I'll highlight what changed. If you're staying on v5, some
patterns won't apply.

Continue with v6 patterns? (recommended even for planning a migration)
```

## Step 2: Load Reference & Rules

**Read the patterns reference:**
```
Read: references/ai-sdk.md
```

**Read the rules (MUST/NEVER constraints):**
```
Read: rules/ai-sdk.md
```

## Step 3: Understand What the User Is Building

Ask what they're working on:

```
AI SDK reference loaded. What are you building?

1. Chat UI — useChat, message rendering, streaming
2. Agent — tool loops, multi-step reasoning
3. Structured output — typed responses from LLMs
4. Streaming API — streamText, server routes
5. All of the above — full reference
6. Debugging — something isn't working
```

Use AskUserQuestion with these options.

## Step 4: Present Relevant Patterns

Based on user selection, highlight the most relevant sections from the reference:

**Chat UI:** Focus on useChat v6 setup (DefaultChatTransport, manual input state, sendMessage), toUIMessageStreamResponse, typed tool parts.

**Agent:** Focus on ToolLoopAgent, stopWhen: stepCountIs(n), InferAgentUIMessage, createAgentUIStreamResponse with uiMessages.

**Structured output:** Focus on Output.object, Output.array, Output.choice, accessing result.output.

**Streaming:** Focus on streamText, toUIMessageStreamResponse, createAgentUIStreamResponse.

**All:** Present the quick migration table and note which sections are available.

**Debugging:** Ask for the error message. Common issues:
- `toDataStreamResponse is not a function` → renamed to `toUIMessageStreamResponse`
- `Cannot read property 'args'` → renamed to `input`
- `generateObject is not a function` → use `generateText` with `Output.object`
- `maxSteps is not a valid option` → use `stopWhen: stepCountIs(n)`
- Request hangs silently → check prompt size (>100K tokens causes silent failures on OpenRouter)

## Step 5: Load Project Rules (if .ruler/ exists)

**Check for project rules:**
```bash
ls .ruler/ai-sdk.md 2>/dev/null
```

If `.ruler/ai-sdk.md` exists, it's already loaded by build agents. Note this to the user.

If it doesn't exist but `.ruler/` does exist:
```
Your project has coding rules (.ruler/) but no AI SDK rules yet.
Run /arc:rules to update, or I can copy them now.
```

## Step 6: Offer Next Steps

```
AI SDK context loaded. Ready to build.

1. Start building → /arc:build or /arc:implement
2. Review existing AI code → I'll check for deprecated API usage
3. Set up from scratch → I'll scaffold the provider, route, and component
```

If user selects "Review existing AI code":
- Grep for deprecated patterns: `generateObject`, `maxTokens`, `maxSteps`, `toDataStreamResponse`, `addToolResult`, `part.args`, `part.result`, `tool-invocation`
- Report findings with file:line references and the correct v6 replacement

</process>

<notes>
- This skill is cross-cutting — invoke anytime, not just during implementation
- The reference file (references/ai-sdk.md) is also loaded by /arc:implement and /arc:build when they detect `ai` in package.json
- The rules file (rules/ai-sdk.md) is copied to .ruler/ by /arc:rules and loaded by all build agents
- OpenRouter is the default provider per stack.md. The patterns use it throughout.
