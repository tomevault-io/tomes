# MANDATORY Tool Restrictions

## BANNED TOOLS — calling these is a skill violation:
- **`EnterPlanMode`** — BANNED. Do NOT call this tool. This skill manages its own workflow and writes results directly. Claude's built-in plan mode would bypass this process.
- **`ExitPlanMode`** — BANNED. You are never in plan mode. There is nothing to exit.

## REQUIRED TOOLS:
- **`AskUserQuestion`** — Preserve the one-question-at-a-time interaction pattern for every question to the user, including confirming routes, choosing options, and validating fixes. In Claude Code, use the tool. In Codex, ask one concise plain-text question at a time unless a structured question tool is actually available in the current mode. This prevents walls of text. If you need to provide context before asking, keep it to 2-3 sentences max, and do not narrate missing tools or fallbacks to the user.

If you feel the urge to "plan before acting" — that urge is satisfied by following the `<process>` steps below. Execute them directly.
</tool_restrictions>

<arc_runtime>
This workflow requires the full Arc bundle, not a prompts-only install.
Resolve the Arc install root from this skill's location and refer to it as `${ARC_ROOT}`.
Use `${ARC_ROOT}/...` for Arc-owned files such as `references/`, `disciplines/`, `agents/`, `templates/`, and `scripts/`.
Use project-local paths such as `.ruler/` or `rules/` for the user's repository.
</arc_runtime>

<required_reading>
**Read these using the Read tool when relevant:**

1. `${ARC_ROOT}/references/touch-targets.md` — Minimum target sizes, pseudo-element expansion, mobile-specific patterns
2. `${ARC_ROOT}/references/ux-laws.md` — Fitts's Law (target sizing), Gestalt proximity (spacing decisions)

# Responsive Audit & Fix

Systematically audit and fix every page for mobile responsiveness, with visual verification via browser screenshots.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the responsive skill to audit and fix mobile responsiveness across your project."

---

<process>

## Phase 1: Setup & Discovery

### Step 1: Select Browser Tool

Prefer Chrome MCP in Claude Code.

If Chrome MCP is unavailable:
- prefer `agent-browser` for navigation, resizing, and screenshots
- fall back to Playwright if browser automation must be scripted directly
- only stop if no browser-capable path is available

### Step 2: Confirm Dev Server

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What's your dev server URL?"
  header: "Dev server"
  options:
    - label: "localhost:3000"
      description: "Default Next.js dev server"
    - label: "localhost:5173"
      description: "Default Vite dev server"
    - label: "localhost:4321"
      description: "Default Astro dev server"
```

Then verify the server is running with the selected browser tool:
```
mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_context_mcp (get or create tab)
mcp__claude-in-chrome__navigate to the dev server URL
mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer action=screenshot
```

If the page doesn't load, tell the user to start their dev server and try again.

### Step 3: Load Design Context

**Read design doc (if exists):**
```
Glob: docs/arc/specs/design-*.md
Fallback: docs/plans/design-*.md
```

If found, read the design doc and note:
- **Aesthetic direction** (tone, memorable element)
- **Typography hierarchy** (display, body, mono fonts)
- **Spacing system** (base unit, scale)
- **Color palette** (so you don't introduce new colors)

This context guides every fix decision. If there's no design doc, that's fine — apply general responsive best practices from the interface rules.

<required_reading>
Read before auditing:
- `rules/interface/layout.md` — Layout patterns, z-index, viewport units
- `rules/interface/interactions.md` — Touch, keyboard, hover patterns
- `rules/interface/spacing.md` — Spacing system and scale
</required_reading>

### Step 4: Discover Routes

**Detect framework:**

| Check | Grep Pattern | Framework |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| `"next"` in `package.json` | Next.js | `app/**/page.{tsx,jsx}` |
| `"@remix-run"` in `package.json` | Remix | `app/routes/**/*.{tsx,jsx}` |
| `"astro"` in `package.json` | Astro | `src/pages/**/*.{astro,mdx}` |
| `"@sveltejs/kit"` in `package.json` | SvelteKit | `src/routes/**/+page.svelte` |
| `"react-router"` or `"@tanstack/react-router"` in `package.json` | Vite + Router | Ask user for route list — no file convention |

**If no framework detected** or routes use a router config (React Router, TanStack Router), ask the user to provide the list of URLs to audit.

**Scan for page files** using the appropriate glob pattern. Exclude API routes (`app/api/**`).

**Build route list** from file paths:
- `app/page.tsx` → `/`
- `app/about/page.tsx` → `/about`
- `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` → `/blog/[slug]` (dynamic)
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` → `/dashboard` (may need auth)

**Flag dynamic routes** — these need sample values from the user.

**Flag potentially auth-protected routes** — routes under common auth-gated paths like `/dashboard`, `/settings`, `/account`, `/admin`.

### Step 5: Confirm Routes with User

Present the discovered routes:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "I found these routes. Any to skip?"
  header: "Routes"
  multiSelect: true
  options:
    - label: "/ (homepage)"
      description: "Public page"
    - label: "/about"
      description: "Public page"
    - label: "/blog/[slug]"
      description: "Dynamic — I'll need a sample slug"
    - label: "/dashboard"
      description: "May need auth — log in via Chrome first"
```

**If dynamic routes exist**, ask for sample slugs:
```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "What slug should I use for /blog/[slug]?"
  header: "Sample URL"
  options:
    - label: "first-post"
      description: "Use /blog/first-post"
    - label: "hello-world"
      description: "Use /blog/hello-world"
```

**If auth-protected routes exist:**
Tell the user: "Some routes may need authentication. Please log in via the Chrome browser, then let me know when you're ready."

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Are the auth-protected routes ready to audit?"
  header: "Auth"
  options:
    - label: "Yes, I'm logged in"
      description: "Continue with all routes including auth-protected ones"
    - label: "Skip auth routes"
      description: "Only audit public pages for now"
```

---

## Phase 2: Page-by-page Audit & Fix

Work through each confirmed route. The loop is tight: **screenshot → analyze → fix → verify → check desktop → next page.**

### For Each Page:

#### Step 1: Mobile Screenshot (375x812)

```
mcp__claude-in-chrome__navigate to [dev-server-url]/[route]
mcp__claude-in-chrome__resize_window width=375 height=812
mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer action=wait duration=2
mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer action=screenshot
```

Wait briefly for any animations or lazy-loaded content to settle before screenshotting.

#### Step 2: Analyze the Screenshot

Look at the screenshot and evaluate against these categories:

**Layout:**
- Horizontal overflow (content wider than viewport, horizontal scrollbar)
- Elements overlapping or clipping
- Grids/flexbox not stacking properly
- Fixed-width elements that don't fit

**Spacing:**
- Content touching container edges (needs padding)
- Inconsistent gaps between elements
- Sections too cramped or too sparse for mobile

**Typography:**
- Body text smaller than 16px (hard to read on mobile)
- Headings that are too large and cause overflow
- Typography hierarchy lost (everything looks the same size)

**Usability:**
- Touch targets smaller than 44x44px (buttons, links, icons)
- Input fields without `text-base` (causes iOS auto-zoom)
- Missing viewport meta tag
- Hover-dependent functionality with no touch alternative

**Design intent (if design doc was loaded):**
- Does the page still feel like the same design at mobile width?
- Is the memorable element preserved (even if scaled)?
- Are the documented spacing values being used (not arbitrary new values)?
- Is the typography hierarchy intact (scaled down proportionally, not collapsed)?

#### Step 3: Fix Issues

Apply fixes in code. Follow these principles:

**Container queries for component-level fixes:**
Use `@container` when fixing a reusable component (card, sidebar, content block, form layout). This makes the component adapt to its container rather than the viewport, so it works in any layout context.

**Viewport queries for page-level layout:**
Use viewport media queries (`@media`) when fixing page structure — grid column counts, section stacking order, navigation collapse, page-level padding.

**Use existing spacing values:**
Reference `rules/interface/spacing.md`. Use the Tailwind spacing scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64). Never invent new spacing values like 13px or 27px.

**Use `h-dvh` not `h-screen`:**
Reference `rules/interface/layout.md`. Dynamic viewport height respects mobile browser chrome.

**Gate hover styles:**
Reference `rules/interface/interactions.md`. Use `@media(hover:hover)` so hover effects don't fire on touch devices.

**Shared components:**
If you recognize the same component causing issues across multiple pages, fix the component source file rather than adding page-specific overrides. This is the natural, correct approach — not a special detection system.

#### Step 4: Verify Mobile Fix

After applying fixes, wait for HMR to recompile before screenshotting:

```
mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer action=wait duration=3
mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer action=screenshot
```

Compare visually to the pre-fix screenshot. Are the issues resolved? If not, iterate.

#### Step 5: Desktop Regression Check (1440x900)

```
mcp__claude-in-chrome__resize_window width=1440 height=900
mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer action=screenshot
```

**Verify desktop is intact.** The fix should not have broken the desktop layout. Check:
- Grid layouts still multi-column
- Spacing still generous (not collapsed)
- Typography still at desktop scale
- No visual artifacts from responsive changes

**If desktop broke:** Fix the regression, then re-verify at both 375px and 1440px before moving on.

#### Step 6: Scroll Check

For pages longer than the viewport:

```
mcp__claude-in-chrome__resize_window width=375 height=812
mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer action=scroll scroll_direction=down scroll_amount=5
mcp__claude-in-chrome__computer action=screenshot
```

Repeat scrolling and screenshotting until you've covered the full page. Look for below-the-fold issues:
- Footer overflow
- Long content sections with broken layout
- Images or embeds that don't fit
- Sticky/fixed elements obscuring content

#### Step 7: Next Page

Move to the next route in the list and repeat from Step 1.

**Progress update:** After each page, briefly note what was fixed: "Homepage: fixed hero grid and nav. Moving to /about."

---

## Phase 3: Summary & Commit

### Step 1: Present Change Summary

After all pages are audited and fixed, present a summary grouped by page and shared component:

```
## Responsive Fixes Applied

### / (homepage)
- Fixed hero grid: 3-column → single-column on mobile (container query on HeroCard)
- Fixed nav: added mobile sheet menu via viewport query
- Fixed section padding: p-4 on mobile, p-16 on desktop

### /about
- Fixed image overflow: added max-w-full to team photos
- Fixed touch targets on CTA buttons: expanded hit area to 44px

### /blog/first-post
- Fixed prose width: constrained to viewport on mobile
- Fixed code blocks: added overflow-x-auto

### Shared: components/Card.tsx
- Added @container query for horizontal → vertical layout below 400px

### Shared: components/Navigation.tsx
- Added mobile sheet menu pattern with viewport query
```

### Step 2: Commit

Batch commit all responsive fixes:

```bash
# Stage only the files you modified — check git status first
git status
git add [list of modified files]
git commit -m "fix: responsive fixes across [N] pages

- [Brief list of key changes]
- Container queries for [components]
- Viewport queries for [page layouts]"
```

### Step 3: Optional Audit Document

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Want me to save a responsive audit doc with all issues found and fixes applied?"
  header: "Audit doc"
  options:
    - label: "Yes, save audit doc"
      description: "Write to docs/audits/ for future reference"
    - label: "No, the commit is enough"
      description: "Skip the audit doc"
```

If yes, write `docs/audits/YYYY-MM-DD-responsive.md` with the full change summary, and commit it.

### Step 4: Final Desktop Verification

Do one final pass: resize to 1440x900 and quickly navigate through all audited pages to confirm everything looks correct at desktop width. This catches any cumulative issues from the page-by-page fixes.

```
mcp__claude-in-chrome__resize_window width=1440 height=900
```

Navigate to each page and take a quick screenshot. If anything looks off, fix and re-commit.

</process>

<success_criteria>
Responsive audit is complete when:
- [ ] Browser tool connected and dev server verified
- [ ] Design doc read (if exists) for aesthetic context
- [ ] Interface rules loaded (layout, interactions, spacing)
- [ ] Routes discovered and confirmed with user
- [ ] Each page screenshotted at 375px (mobile)
- [ ] Issues identified and fixed per page
- [ ] Each fix verified with re-screenshot at mobile
- [ ] Desktop (1440px) checked after mobile fixes — no regressions
- [ ] Final desktop pass across all pages
- [ ] Changes committed
- [ ] Activity log updated
</success_criteria>

## Interop

- Invoked after `/arc:implement` — the natural post-build polish step
- Reads design docs from `/arc:design` for aesthetic context
- References `rules/interface/layout.md`, `interactions.md`, `spacing.md` for implementation patterns
- Uses **Chrome MCP** (`mcp__claude-in-chrome__*`) as the preferred browser path in Claude Code
- Uses **agent-browser** as the preferred browser fallback outside Claude Code
- Uses Playwright when direct browser scripting is needed
- Follows `/arc:commit` discipline for commits
- Can invoke `web-design-guidelines` skill for compliance review (if available)

<arc_log>
**After completing this skill, append to the activity log.**
See: `${ARC_ROOT}/references/arc-log.md`

Entry: `/arc:responsive — [N] pages audited, [N] issues fixed`
</arc_log>
