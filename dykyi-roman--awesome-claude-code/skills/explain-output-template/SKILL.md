# Explain Output Templates

## Overview

Provides structured output templates for the 5 explanation modes. Each template defines sections, content depth, and formatting requirements for consistent, high-quality explanations.

## Mode Selection

| Mode | Target | Depth | Audience | Trigger |
|------|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| `quick` | Single file | 1-2 screens | Developer | File path |
| `deep` | Module/directory | Full analysis | Senior dev / Architect | Directory path |
| `onboarding` | Entire project | Comprehensive guide | New team member | `.` or project root |
| `business` | Feature/process | Non-technical | PM / Stakeholder | Explicit mode |
| `qa` | On-demand | Answer-focused | Any | Explicit mode |

## Template: Quick Mode

For single file analysis. Compact, fits 1-2 terminal screens.

```markdown
# Explanation: {FileName}

## Purpose
{One sentence — what this class/file does and why it exists.}

## Business Context
{Which business process or domain concept this participates in.}

## Key Responsibilities
- {Responsibility 1 — what it does}
- {Responsibility 2 — what it does}
- {Responsibility 3 — what it does}

## Business Rules
| Rule | Location | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| {rule name} | Line {N} | {what the rule enforces} |

## Data Flow
```
{Entry} → {Processing step 1} → {Processing step 2} → {Output}
```

## Dependencies
| Dependency | Role | Direction |
|------------|------|-----------|
| {ClassName} | {what it provides} | {inbound/outbound} |

## Important Notes
- {Non-obvious behavior, edge case, or architectural decision}
```

**Guidelines:**
- Maximum 40-50 lines of output
- No diagrams (too verbose for quick mode)
- Focus on "what" and "why", not "how"
- Use business language where possible

## Template: Deep Mode

For module/directory analysis. Full analysis with diagrams.

```markdown
# Deep Explanation: {Module/Directory Name}

## Overview
{2-3 sentences — what this module does, its role in the system, key design decisions.}

## Architecture
{Mermaid component diagram showing internal structure}

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Entry Point] --> B[Service Layer]
    B --> C[Domain Logic]
    C --> D[Persistence]
```

## Components

### Layer Map
| Layer | Files | Key Classes |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Presentation | {N} | {Controller, Action} |
| Application | {N} | {UseCase, Service} |
| Domain | {N} | {Entity, VO, Service} |
| Infrastructure | {N} | {Repository, Adapter} |

### Key Classes
{For each important class: purpose, responsibilities, relationships}

## Business Processes

### Process: {ProcessName}
**Trigger:** {what starts it}
**Actor:** {who initiates}
**Steps:**
1. {step 1}
2. {step 2}
3. {step 3}

## Data Flow

### Main Request Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant A as Action
    participant U as UseCase
    participant D as Domain
    participant R as Repository
    C->>A: HTTP Request
    A->>U: Command
    U->>D: Domain Operation
    D->>R: Persist
    R-->>A: Result
    A-->>C: Response
```

### Data Transformation Chain
| Step | Class | Input Type | Output Type |
|------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| {step} | {class} | {type} | {type} |

## Domain Model

```

**Guidelines:**
- Include Mermaid diagrams (component, sequence, state)
- Cover all aspects: architecture, business, data, state
- Depth proportional to module complexity
- Include quality observations from auditors

|-----------------|-----------|
| Understand business logic | `src/Domain/` |
| See API endpoints | `src/Presentation/Api/` |
| Find a use case | `src/Application/UseCase/` |
| Check database queries | `src/Infrastructure/Repository/` |
| Add a new feature | Follow existing UseCase pattern |

## Glossary
| Term | Meaning | Code Reference |
|------|---------|---------------|
| {term} | {definition} | {class name} |

## Suggested Documentation
{Documentation suggestion — see coordinator behavior}
```

**Guidelines:**
- Write for someone seeing the project for the first time
- Include "How to navigate" section
- Build comprehensive glossary
- Use C4 diagrams for architecture
- Keep language accessible

## Template: Business Mode

For non-technical stakeholders. No code references.

```markdown
# {Feature/System} — Business Overview

## What Does It Do?
{Plain language explanation — no technical jargon.}

## Who Uses It?
| Actor | What They Do |
|-------|-------------|
| {role} | {their interaction with the system} |

## Key Business Processes

### {Process 1}
**When:** {trigger in business terms}
**What happens:**
1. {step in business language}
2. {step}
3. {step}
**Result:** {outcome}

## Business Rules
| Rule | Why It Exists |
|------|--------------|
| {rule in plain language} | {business justification} |

## Data & Reports
| Data | What It Shows | Updated |
|------|--------------|---------|
| {data point} | {what it means} | {frequency} |

## System Interactions
```mermaid
graph LR
    C[Customer] -->|places order| S[Our System]
    S -->|sends confirmation| C
    S -->|charges| P[Payment Provider]
    S -->|ships via| W[Warehouse]
```

## Limitations & Constraints
- {business limitation 1}
- {business limitation 2}
```

**Guidelines:**
- Zero code references
- Business language only
- Focus on "what" and "why", never "how" technically
- Use simple flow diagrams

## Template: QA Mode

For interactive question-answering.

```markdown
## Question: {User's Question}

### Answer
{Direct, concise answer to the question.}

### Details
{Supporting explanation with evidence from code.}

### Code References
| File | Line | Relevance |
|------|------|-----------|
| {file} | {line} | {why this is relevant} |

### Related
- {Related concept or question the user might want to explore next}
```

**Guidelines:**
- Answer the specific question first
- Provide supporting evidence
- Suggest related areas to explore
- Keep focused — don't explain everything

## Documentation Suggestion Block

Append to all modes except `qa`:

```markdown
---

## Suggested Documentation

{One of the following based on analysis:}

### Existing documentation found:
- `{path/to/doc}` — consider updating with insights from this analysis

### No documentation found:
Consider generating documentation:
```
/generate-documentation {analyzed_path}
```
```

## Integration

This skill is used by:
- `explain-coordinator` — selects template based on mode, formats final output
