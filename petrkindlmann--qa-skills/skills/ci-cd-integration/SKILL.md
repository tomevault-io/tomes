<objective>
Design CI/CD pipelines for test execution. Covers GitHub Actions and GitLab CI pipeline templates, parallelism and sharding, artifact management, flaky test quarantine, and quality gates. Use this skill over others when the question is about running tests in a pipeline rather than writing them.
</objective>

## Discovery Questions

1. **Which CI platform?** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Jenkins? This skill focuses on GitHub Actions and GitLab CI.
2. **What test types need to run?** Unit, integration, E2E, visual regression, performance? Each has different resource and timing needs.
3. **What is the current CI duration?** If over 10 minutes, parallelism and sharding are essential.
4. **How many developers push per day?** High-frequency teams need aggressive concurrency controls and caching.
5. **What triggers should run which tests?** Not every push needs a full E2E suite.
6. **Check `.agents/qa-project-context.md` first.** Respect existing CI conventions and infrastructure constraints.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Fast feedback: right tests at the right time.** Unit tests on every push (under 2 min). E2E on PRs (under 10 min). Full suite on merge and nightly.
2. **Parallel first: shard tests across workers.** A 20-minute serial suite becomes 5 minutes across 4 shards. Always worth the runner cost.
3. **Artifacts are evidence.** Every CI run must store traces, screenshots, coverage reports, and HTML reports. Without artifacts, CI failures are undebuggable.
4. **Flaky tests need quarantine, not retries.** Retrying hides the problem. Move flaky tests to a separate non-blocking job, track them, and fix them.
5. **Quality gates at every stage.** Define what must pass before code moves forward. Gates get stricter as code gets closer to production.

---

> **Calibrate to your team maturity** (set `team_maturity` in `.agents/qa-project-context.md`):
> - **startup** — Single pipeline job: lint + unit tests + one E2E smoke test on PR. Fast feedback over completeness.
> - **growing** — Separate jobs for unit, integration, E2E. Parallelization, artifact uploads, test result publishing, flaky test quarantine.
> - **established** — Full matrix: parallelized E2E sharding, multi-environment promotion gates, performance and security scans, deployment-gated quality checks, SLA-backed pipelines.

## Pipeline Architecture

```
Push to branch:
  ┌─────────────┐
  │ lint + types │  (30s)
  └──────┬──────┘
         │
  ┌──────▼──────┐
  │  unit tests  │  (1-2 min)
  └──────┬──────┘
         │ (pass)
         ▼
  PR opened/updated:
  ┌──────────────┐
  │  integration  │  (2-3 min)
  └──────┬───────┘
         │
  ┌──────▼──────────┐
  │  E2E (sharded)   │  (5-8 min)
  └──────┬──────────┘
         │
  ┌──────▼──────┐
  │ merge report │
  └─────────────┘

Merge to main:
  ┌───────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐
  │  full E2E  │  │  visual   │  │  perf     │
  └─────┬─────┘  └────┬─────┘  └────┬─────┘
        └──────────────┼─────────────┘
                       ▼
                ┌─────────────┐
                │   deploy     │
                └─────────────┘

Nightly (scheduled):
  full suite + security scan + a11y audit + flaky quarantine
```

### What Runs When

| Trigger | Tests | Max Duration |

## GitHub Actions Templates

For complete, copy-paste-ready workflow files, see `references/github-actions-templates.md`.

### Key Concepts

**Concurrency groups** prevent wasted runs when a branch gets multiple pushes:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: tests-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

**Matrix strategy** for sharding tests across runners:

```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false
  matrix:
    shard: [1, 2, 3, 4]
steps:
  - run: npx playwright test --shard=${{ matrix.shard }}/4
```

**Smarter sharding** — past 10–15 shards, naïve hash-based splitting wastes runner time on uneven shards. Use a balancer:

- **`knapsack-pro`** (timing-data based, supports Playwright/Jest/Cypress/RSpec) — distributes by historical duration.
- **CloudBees Smart Tests** (formerly **Launchable**) — ML-based prioritization + Test Impact Analysis; runs only the tests likely to fail given the diff.
- **Datadog Test Optimization** — TIA + flake management; shard-balancing by historical time.
- **Trunk Flaky Tests** — flake-aware quarantine + retry budgeting.

For self-hosted runners on Kubernetes, use **Actions Runner Controller (`gha-runner-scale-set`)** — Helm-installed, auto-scales runner pods per workflow. Replaces the deprecated `actions-runner-controller/runner-deployment` CRD; current name is `arc-runner-set`.

> **GitHub Actions versioning (May 2026):** the `actions/*` v4 family (`checkout`, `setup-node`, `cache`, `upload-artifact`, `download-artifact`) has rolled to v5/v6/v7/v8 on the Node 24 runner; Node 20 is deprecated on GH-hosted runners. Examples below pin v4/v5 for stability — verify the current major before adopting in new pipelines and use Dependabot to keep them current.

**Caching** to avoid reinstalling on every run:

```yaml
# Node modules: handled by setup-node's cache option
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with: { node-version: 22, cache: npm }

# Playwright browsers: cache separately
- name: Cache Playwright browsers
  id: playwright-cache
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/ms-playwright
    key: playwright-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}

- name: Install Playwright browsers
  if: steps.playwright-cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
  run: npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

**Artifact management** for reports and traces:

```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
  with:
    name: test-results-${{ matrix.shard }}
    path: |
      test-results/
      playwright-report/
      coverage/
    retention-days: 7
```

**Merging sharded reports** into a single HTML report:

```yaml
merge-reports:
  needs: e2e
  if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with: { node-version: 22, cache: npm }
    - run: npm ci
    - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
      with: { pattern: 'test-results-*', path: all-results }
    - run: npx playwright merge-reports --reporter=html all-results
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with: { name: playwright-report, path: playwright-report/, retention-days: 14 }
```

### Status Checks Configuration

Required status checks protect your main branch. Configure in GitHub repo settings:

1. Go to Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules
2. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
3. Add these required checks: `lint`, `unit-tests`, `e2e` (all shards)
4. Enable "Require branches to be up to date before merging"

## GitLab CI Templates

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
stages: [validate, test, e2e, deploy]

variables:
  NODE_ENV: test
  npm_config_cache: '$CI_PROJECT_DIR/.npm'

cache:
  key: ${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}
  paths: [.npm/, node_modules/]

lint:
  stage: validate
  image: node:22-alpine
  script: [npm ci --prefer-offline, npm run lint, npm run type-check]

unit-tests:
  stage: test
  image: node:22-alpine
  script: [npm ci --prefer-offline, 'npm run test:ci -- --coverage']
  coverage: '/All files[^|]*\|[^|]*\s+([\d\.]+)/'
  artifacts:
    when: always
    paths: [coverage/]
    reports:
      junit: junit.xml
      coverage_report: { coverage_format: cobertura, path: coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml }

e2e-tests:
  stage: e2e
  image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.59.1-noble
  parallel: 4  # GitLab provides CI_NODE_INDEX and CI_NODE_TOTAL automatically
  script:
    - npm ci --prefer-offline
    - npm run build
    - npm start &
    - npx wait-on http://localhost:3000 --timeout 60000
    - npx playwright test --shard=$CI_NODE_INDEX/$CI_NODE_TOTAL
  artifacts:
    when: always
    paths: [test-results/, playwright-report/]
    expire_in: 7 days
    reports:
      junit: test-results/junit.xml  # GitLab parses this and shows results in MR UI
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH

deploy-staging:
  stage: deploy
  script: [./deploy.sh staging]
  rules: [{ if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH' }]
  needs: [unit-tests, e2e-tests]
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Test Result Publishing to PR Comments

Post test results directly on the PR for visibility:

```yaml
# Add after test step in GitHub Actions
- name: Publish test results
  uses: dorny/test-reporter@v1
  if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
  with:
    name: Test Results
    path: test-results/junit.xml
    reporter: jest-junit  # or java-junit for Playwright

- name: Comment coverage on PR
  uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
  with:
    header: coverage
    path: coverage/coverage-summary.md
```

### Conditional Test Execution

Only test what changed to save CI time:

```yaml
- name: Detect changed files
  id: changes
  uses: dorny/paths-filter@v3
  with:
    filters: |
      frontend:
        - 'src/**'
        - 'e2e/**'
      backend:
        - 'api/**'
        - 'lib/**'
      config:
        - 'package.json'
        - 'playwright.config.ts'

- name: Run E2E tests
  if: steps.changes.outputs.frontend == 'true' || steps.changes.outputs.config == 'true'
  run: npx playwright test

- name: Run API tests
  if: steps.changes.outputs.backend == 'true' || steps.changes.outputs.config == 'true'
  run: npm run test:api
```

### Test Timing Optimization

Playwright `--shard` distributes tests by file, balancing duration from previous runs. For custom balancing, generate timing data: `npx playwright test --reporter=json | jq '[.suites[].specs[] | {file: .file, duration: .tests[].results[].duration}]'`. For Jest, use `jest-slow-test-reporter` to identify slow tests.

### Flaky Test Quarantine

Separate flaky tests into a non-blocking job:

```yaml
e2e-stable:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - run: npx playwright test --grep-invert @flaky
  # This job is required for merge

e2e-quarantine:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  continue-on-error: true  # Non-blocking
  steps:
    - run: npx playwright test --grep @flaky
    - name: Report flaky results
      if: failure()
      run: |
        echo "::warning::Quarantined tests failed. Review and fix or remove."
```

Tag flaky tests in your test files:

```typescript
test('sometimes fails due to race condition @flaky', async ({ page }) => {
  // This test is quarantined -- runs in CI but doesn't block merges
});
```

Track flaky tests over time. If a quarantined test passes 10 consecutive runs, remove the `@flaky` tag.

### Cache Strategies

| Layer | Path | Cache Key |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Node modules | (handled by `setup-node` `cache: npm`) | automatic |
| Playwright browsers | `~/.cache/ms-playwright` | `pw-{os}-{hash(package-lock.json)}` |
| Build cache (Next.js) | `.next/cache` | `nextjs-{os}-{hash(lockfile)}-{hash(src)}` |
| Test fixtures | `e2e/fixtures/.cache` | `test-data-{hash(seed.sql)}` |

Use `actions/cache@v4` for layers 2-4. Add `restore-keys` for build caches to allow partial matches.

### Slack/Teams Notification on Failure

Use `slackapi/slack-github-action@v2.0.0` with `webhook-type: incoming-webhook`. Condition on `if: failure() && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'` so notifications only fire for main branch failures. See `references/github-actions-templates.md` (Nightly Full Suite) for a complete example.

## Quality Gates

### Gate Definitions

| Gate | When | Required Checks | Blocking? |
|------|------|-----------------|-----------|
| **PR Gate** | PR opened/updated | lint, type-check, unit tests | Yes |
| **Merge Gate** | Before merge to main | + E2E smoke suite | Yes |
| **Deploy Gate** | Before production deploy | + full E2E, visual regression, perf budget | Yes |
| **Nightly Gate** | Scheduled 2am daily | full suite, security scan, a11y audit | Alert only |

### PR Gate (fast, under 3 minutes)

```yaml
pr-gate:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - run: npm run lint
    - run: npm run type-check
    - run: npm test -- --ci --coverage
    - run: |
        COVERAGE=$(npx coverage-summary --json | jq '.total.lines.pct')
        if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < 80" | bc -l) )); then
          echo "::error::Coverage $COVERAGE% is below 80% threshold"
          exit 1
        fi
```

### Merge Gate (comprehensive, under 10 minutes)

Requires PR Gate + E2E smoke tests. Configure as required status checks in branch protection.

### Deploy Gate (full confidence, under 15 minutes)

```yaml
deploy-gate:
  needs: [unit-tests, e2e-tests, visual-tests]
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Check performance budget
      run: |
        npx lighthouse-ci assert --config=lighthouserc.json
    - name: Deploy to production
      if: success()
      run: ./deploy.sh production
```

### Nightly Gate (thorough, up to 30 minutes)

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # 2am UTC daily
```

Runs everything: full E2E suite across all browsers, security scan (npm audit, Snyk), accessibility audit (axe-core), and the flaky quarantine suite. Results go to Slack, not as blocking checks.

---

## Anti-Patterns

### 1. Running all tests on every commit
A 20-minute full suite on every push destroys developer velocity. Use the pipeline architecture above: fast tests on push, comprehensive tests on PR and merge.

### 2. No artifact storage
When CI tests fail, developers need traces, screenshots, and logs to debug. Without artifacts, every failure requires a "reproduce locally" cycle that wastes hours.

### 3. Retrying flaky tests without tracking them
Adding `retries: 3` hides flakiness. The test passes on retry, the report is green, but the underlying race condition persists. Quarantine flaky tests, track them in a dashboard, and fix the root cause.

### 4. CI-only failures without local reproduction steps
If a test only fails in CI, document why (e.g., different timezone, missing env var, screen resolution). Add a `Makefile` or script that replicates CI conditions locally:

```bash
# Reproduce CI environment locally
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/work -w /work \
  mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.49.0-noble \
  npx playwright test --project=chromium
```

### 5. Shared state between CI jobs
Jobs that depend on files from other jobs without using artifacts or proper `needs` dependencies. Each job starts fresh. Use `actions/upload-artifact` and `actions/download-artifact` to pass data.

### 6. No concurrency controls
Multiple CI runs for the same branch waste resources. Always use concurrency groups with `cancel-in-progress: true`.

### 7. Hardcoded secrets in workflow files
Never put tokens, passwords, or API keys in YAML. Use GitHub Actions secrets (`${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}`) or GitLab CI/CD variables.

### 8. Ignoring job timeouts
A stuck test can consume a runner for hours. Always set `timeout-minutes` on jobs and `actionTimeout` / `navigationTimeout` in test configs.

---

## Done When

- Pipeline runs unit, integration, and E2E tests on every PR
- Flaky tests quarantined in a non-blocking job with a tracking ticket — not silently retried without a plan
- Test artifacts (reports, screenshots, traces) uploaded and accessible for every CI run
- Concurrency groups configured to prevent redundant runs on the same branch
- Secrets managed via the CI secrets store — no tokens or passwords hardcoded in workflow files
