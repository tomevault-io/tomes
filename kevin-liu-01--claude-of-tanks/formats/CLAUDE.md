## Overview
<!-- agent-docs:fill:overview -->
Browser-native Three.js armored combat game. The runtime combines a fixed-step
60 Hz simulation, procedural first-party vehicle fleet, thirty battlefields,
garage/showroom presentation, bots, armor/ballistics/modules, and mobile input.
Treat current `origin/main` as active shared work: isolate broad changes in a
worktree and never stage generated tank work wholesale.

## Architecture Pointers
<!-- agent-docs:fill:architecture -->
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#publishing-to-shared-main` — shared Codex/Claude integration,
  overlap review and preflight; read before integrating or publishing changes.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — original module contracts and simulation invariants.
- `docs/MULTIPLAYER-ARCHITECTURE.md` — authoritative multiplayer migration.
- `docs/tank-generation/README.md` — source/markup intake, measured construction,
  prompts, quality gates and resumable tank-generation handoffs. Read before
  new source-backed tanks, family rebuilds or exact-surface geometry repairs.
  Begin with [`docs/tank-generation/SKILL.md`](docs/tank-generation/SKILL.md);
  this documentation-only directory is not discovered by the source-code index.
- `docs/tank-generation/fleet-style-performance-priority.md` — urgent open
  fleet-wide primitive/cost, switching, roller/track, chassis-closure and
  material-role work; read before adding further tank micro-detail.
- `src/main.ts` — strict typed boot, scene composition, UI flow, and render-loop
  wiring across extracted lifecycle owners; keep changes surgical.
- `src/game/stateCore.ts` — dependency-free typed session shell, event bus,
  and deterministic integration RNG.
- `src/game/state.ts` — battle roster and authoritative simulation integration.
- `src/sim/` — movement, armor, damage, spotting, and ballistics logic.
- `src/net/` — transport-independent protocol, lobby, authority, and snapshots.

## Stack
<!-- agent-docs:auto:stack start -->
- **Name:** claude-of-tanks
- **Package manager:** npm
- **Languages:** typescript
- **Framework:** vite
<!-- agent-docs:auto:stack end -->

## Commands
<!-- agent-docs:auto:commands start -->
- Package scripts detected: 122. Use `package.json` as the exhaustive source.
- `npm run build` - VITE_PUBLIC_BUILD=1 vite build && node tools/strip-nc-assets.mjs
- `npm run test` - node tools/run-selftests.mjs core
- `npm test` runs the pre → core → post receipt groups; a receipt whose observable inputs are
  byte-identical to its last PASS is skipped with a SKIP line (`COT_SELFTEST_CACHE=0 npm test`
  runs everything), every failure in a group is reported in one run (`COT_SELFTEST_FAIL_FAST=1`
  stops at the first), and `tank:release:check` runs its fleet probes beside the suite and the
  build after the serial scoring steps. See docs/DEVELOPMENT.md "Fast checks".
- `npm run typecheck` - node node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit && node tools/core-unused-check.mjs
- `npm run agent-docs` - node scripts/run-agent-docs.ts
- Keep this block compact. Put full command catalogs in a generated command index, not in AGENTS.md.

## Repo graph sidecar (Graphify)
<!-- agent-docs:auto:repo-graph start -->
- Use Graphify for repo topology, path/explain/affected questions, PR risk, and unfamiliar codebase orientation.
- Use `rg` for exact strings; use Kevin-Wiki `qmd` for people, tools, decisions, and compiled wiki knowledge.
- Use `agent-browser` for browser/UI work; use Playwright only for committed regression tests.
- Runtime memories (Hermes/Hindsight/Honcho) are not project truth until written back to AGENTS.md, SKILL.md, or the wiki.
- Status: `cd ~/Documents/GitHub/kevin-wiki && npm run graphify:sidecar -- status --run outputs/graphify/claude-of-tanks`
- Build from this repo: `PROJECT_ROOT="$(pwd)" && cd ~/Documents/GitHub/kevin-wiki && npm run graphify:sidecar -- build "$PROJECT_ROOT" --run outputs/graphify/claude-of-tanks --no-viz`
- Query after build: `cd ~/Documents/GitHub/kevin-wiki && npm run graphify:sidecar -- query "what should I inspect first?" --run outputs/graphify/claude-of-tanks`
- Never run Graphify installers/hooks or commit generated `graphify-out/` artifacts.
<!-- agent-docs:auto:repo-graph end -->

## Environment variables (names only)
<!-- agent-docs:auto:env start -->
- `VITE_COT_DEV_FLEET_KEY`
<!-- agent-docs:auto:env end -->

## Conventions & invariants
<!-- agent-docs:fill:conventions -->
- Runtime units are meters, seconds, and radians; tank forward is local `+Z`.
- Simulation advances at `SIM_DT = 1/60`; rendering may be variable-rate.
- Simulation randomness is seeded/injected. Do not use wall-clock time or
  `Math.random()` in authoritative logic.
- Keep simulation and network modules Node-runnable and free of DOM/WebGL.
- No per-frame allocation in established hot loops; reuse scratch state.
- All playable tanks are first-party procedural runtime models. Source GLBs
  are comparison/authoring inputs, never a playable loading path.
- Every first-party file and asset is attributed to Kevin B. Liu by
  `NOTICE.md`; every playable spec inherits the named authorship record from
  `src/authorship.ts`. Record third-party exceptions in `docs/ATTRIBUTION.md`
  and run `npm run attribution:check`.
- Every game-mode rule (gravity, speed, hull, damage, reload, ammunition, equipment,
  consumables, respawn, clock, roster split, assault escalation, score targets) lives in
  `src/sim/matchRuleset.ts`; the mode controller, `state.ts`, the authority, the HUD and the
  rule cards read that table. Never add a mode literal elsewhere.
- Objective markers (spawns, flags, zones, sectors, goals, caches) come from one derivation,
  `src/ui/minimapObjectives.ts`, and one glyph set, `src/ui/objectiveGlyphs.ts`; the HUD
  minimap and `src/game/matchModeWorldPresentation.ts` both consume them. A new objective
  gets a marker kind and a glyph there, never an ad-hoc drawing in the HUD or the world.
- Export only what another file imports: `node tools/unused-exports.mjs` lists the
  exports nothing else mentions and drives the periodic un-export passes;
  `npm run typecheck` runs the unused-locals check on the core owners. Leave
  hash-pinned sources (vehicle profiles, terrain, sky, impact decals, the authority,
  match placement) to their receipts.
- Add focused `*.selftest.mjs` coverage and include it in `npm test`.
- Any playable tank addition or geometry/profile change must run the complete
  combat-anatomy procedure: `npm run tank:anatomy:update`,
  `npm run tank:anatomy:check`, then the targeted
  `npm run tank:release:check -- --ids=<ids> --gate`. The update deliberately
  refreshes armor/module/crew receipts and all fleet technical diagrams.

## Gotchas / never-do-X
<!-- agent-docs:fill:gotchas -->
- Never modify or clean the shared dirty checkout to integrate unrelated work.
- Never equate a player/entity ID with a vehicle spec ID; duplicate tank picks
  are valid in multiplayer.
- Never send hidden enemy coordinates to a client and rely on rendering to hide
  them; spotting filters snapshots before serialization.
- Never make a client authoritative for hits, damage, reloads, or match result.
- Do not import full fleet builders into a new boot-critical module.
- Do not add multicrew roles or multiple player seats inside one vehicle.
- Never deploy per commit. Git auto-deploys are disabled in `vercel.json`
  (`git.deploymentEnabled` off for `main` and `codex/*`); production changes
  only through the once-per-round prebuilt CLI deploy in `docs/DEPLOYS.md`
  (`vercel pull --yes --environment=production && vercel build --prod &&
  vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod`, scope `kl01s-projects`) after a green
  gate. Do not add a second gate (Ignored Build Step) or a CI deploy.

## Extending this project's agent system
<!-- agent-docs:fill:extending -->
Refresh generated blocks with `KEVIN_WIKI_ROOT=/Users/kevinliu/repos/Kevin-Wiki-v3
npm run agent-docs -- scaffold .`, then run the corresponding `doctor --json`.
Edit prose only below `agent-docs:fill` markers; generated auto blocks are owned
by the scaffold command.
