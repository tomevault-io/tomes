## Purpose

Provide one authoritative match path for campaign, LAN, private, and ranked
play without importing Three.js rendering or DOM state.

## Mental model & key files

- `protocol.ts` owns the strict wire vocabulary, envelopes, sequence arithmetic,
  and untrusted input validation.
- `lobby.ts` owns the strict canonical room model: teams, capacity, readiness,
  permissions, host migration, round state, and start policy.
- `lobbyRuntime.ts` owns typed lobby transport sequencing, payload admission,
  broadcast, and the lossless lobby-to-match channel handoff.
- `playerNames.ts`, `roomInvite.ts`, and `signalEndpoint.ts` own strict commander
  identity, share-link parsing, and deployment-aware signaling URL policy.
- `signalingClient.ts` owns strict request correlation, durable event polling,
  reconnect backoff, room-seat resume, and RTC-session epoch rotation.
- `matchRuntime.ts` owns fixed ticks, input ordering, snapshots, and client time.
- `inputCadence.ts` bounds replaceable input uploads independently from display
  refresh while preserving immediate control edges.
- `browserInputRuntime.ts` composes finite-point aim, action edges, and cadence
  behind explicit multiplayer intent; solo boot must not import it.
- `snapshot.ts` owns quantization, visibility filtering, and interpolation.
- `snapshotWireCodec.ts` owns strict compact binary snapshot rows; protocol v2 uses
  explicit snapshot acknowledgements, per-peer deltas, and periodic keyframes.
- `loopbackTransport.ts`, `channelTransport.ts`, and `webrtcPeer.ts` implement
  the same bounded transport contract.
- `localSession.ts` proves solo play traverses the real host/client path.
- `localTankPrediction.ts` owns typed local input replay and presentation-only
  correction. Its reconciliation stages authority seeding, input
  acknowledgement/replay, error accounting, bounded presentation correction,
  and terminal cleanup; it never owns combat or match results.
- `networkFramePump.ts` owns browser host/client frame order, snapshot/event
  application, input cadence, snapshot barriers, and network diagnostics.
- `networkBattleBarrier.ts` owns first-authority and peer-ready predicates plus
  the identity-bound idempotent READY retry lease.
- `networkRoomCoordinator.ts` owns browser room subscriptions, garage/menu/chat
  presentation, selection commands, readiness, and rematch admission.
- `networkLobbyPreloader.ts` coalesces joined-room transfers, retries failed
  optional chunks, and warms new roster builders. It reasserts canonical map
  intent on waiting-room packets; the world coordinator owns in-flight/cache
  deduplication and retry admission, not a permanent map-ID latch. Garage
  browsing must preserve joined-room preparation, including while Not Ready.
- `networkBattleLaunchRuntime.ts` owns private/LAN, retained-room rematch, and
  ranked launch policy, including cold-loader presentation and terminal cleanup.
- `networkBattlePresentationRuntime.ts` owns the shared cold-client path from
  opaque loader through parallel module/world/transport acquisition, hidden
  roster preparation, initial authority, warmup, atomic visual activation,
  black-frame validation, reveal, and then all-peer readiness.
- `networkBattlePresentationAccess.ts` keeps that deep multiplayer-only owner
  out of Garage/solo boot and retries failed intent transfers.
- `networkBattleActivationRuntime.ts` owns the atomic prepared-visual transfer
  into live player or spectator presentation: world/HUD/FX/result reset, phase
  publication, camera ownership, and Garage shutdown.
- `connectionRecovery.ts` owns reconnect status and the single bounded failure
  edge; transport replacement remains below it.
- `rankedServiceClient.ts` owns service-scoped ladder identity and queue polling;
  `dedicatedClient.ts` owns authenticated WebSocket handoff and reconnect.
- `privateRoomSession.ts` owns typed lobby WebRTC composition and
  `rtcIceLease.ts` owns expiring TURN generations;
  `privateMatchHandoff.ts` is the strict lobby-to-match boundary: it
  deterministically fills open team slots with bots
  and releases those same channels to match authority.
- `browserBattleBridge.ts` is presentation-only and must stay lazy from main.

## Patterns and invariants

- Player/entity identity is independent from `specId`.
- Authority accepts controls only; it computes every gameplay result.
- Spotting filters data before serialization.
- Queues, extrapolation, catch-up, sequences, and payload sizes are bounded.
- WebRTC control/events stay reliable and ordered; replaceable snapshots and
  live input use the unordered zero-retransmit state lane. Fire/consumable
  edges repeat until acknowledged and authority deduplicates them. WebSocket
  snapshots and input coalesce under backpressure so stale state cannot
  consume control headroom.
- Initial RTC recovery replays pending SDP before creating a new ICE
  generation. Duplicate descriptions must be idempotent; never overlap offers
  merely because a fresh browser is slow.
- Local prediction replays the exact shared movement path. Reconciliation error
  is presentation-only: horizontal hull motion, terrain support/tilt, and live
  turret aim use separate bounded decay channels. Contacts may extend smoothing
  but must never change authority, collision, or ballistic state. Keep the
  collision adapter stable for the predictor lifetime; do not allocate a new
  closure for every replayed fixed step.
- Modules remain Node-runnable with no DOM/WebGL dependency.
- Visual activation must remain one operation after roster/snapshot preparation
  and warmup; do not publish battle phase or camera state piecemeal from
  `main.ts`. Send READY only after the verified battlefield frame and awaited
  loader fade. Authority still holds gameplay until every peer is ready and
  its countdown expires; visible loading peers show WAITING FOR COMMANDERS.
- Failed entry keeps an opaque loader through Garage restoration and its first
  paint. Settle in-flight world activation before restoring Garage, without
  waiting on an unrelated stalled transport.
- Both first-entry and retained-rematch hosts must acquire the selected world's
  collision before preparing authority. Guest module, world and connection work
  stays concurrent; a retained transport does not remove the host dependency.
- Unexpected black-frame watchdog rejection fails closed after awaited resource
  draining; the watchdog itself owns compatibility fallback. Preserve the
  cancellation checkpoint before reporting graphics failure. A null lobby
  callback is also used for successful match handoff, so it must not blindly
  cancel the room's in-flight map build.
- A bridge must remain private until its exact roster and viewer-bearing first
  snapshot are ready. Keep that order in `networkBattlePresentationRuntime.ts`;
  failed unpublished bridges are disposed before the launcher handles cleanup.
- Tests exercise the public host/client interface, not private internals.

## Verification

Run `node src/net/browserInputRuntime.selftest.mjs`, `node src/net/net.selftest.mjs`,
`node src/net/privateMatchHandoff.selftest.mjs`, then `npm test` and
`npm run build`. Network adapters additionally require browser-pair proof.
