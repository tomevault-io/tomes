# claude-of-tanks / server

## Purpose

Provide bounded network coordination and dedicated ranked authority.
The signaling server relays WebRTC descriptions/ICE only and never gameplay.

## Mental model and invariants

- `roomStore.ts` owns private-room rendezvous membership.
- `distributedRoomStore.ts` owns durable Redis membership and signaling mailboxes.
- `roomCode.ts` keeps room-code generation inside the typed serverless
  closure; production `.js` entries must not import raw `.ts` source files.
- `signalingServer.ts` owns HTTP upgrade, origin/rate/payload gates, and relay.
- `dedicatedMatchRegistry.ts` owns authenticated match lifecycle and reconnects.
- `dedicatedMatchServer.ts` owns the authoritative WebSocket service boundary.
- `rankedMatchmaker.ts` owns bounded queues, team balance, and match-ticket handoff;
  `ratingStore.ts` owns bearer identities, persistent Elo, and idempotent results.
- `dedicatedWorldCollision.ts` inflates match-local state from generated
  per-map collision shards; do not hand-edit their records or checksum index.
  Keep idle map retention bounded and release active terrain leases on teardown.
- A v1 browser-hosted room closes if its host leaves; never silently migrate a
  ranked authority to a player.
- Production signaling must run behind TLS with an explicit origin allowlist.
- TURN credentials come from deployment configuration and are never committed.
- Keep payloads, queues, rooms, rates, and lifetimes bounded.

## Verification

Run `node server/signaling.selftest.mjs` and
`node server/dedicatedWorldCollision.selftest.mjs`. Ranked changes additionally
run the rating, matchmaker, HTTP, and real-WebSocket tests. Regenerate world manifests
with `tools/capture-world-collision-manifests.mjs` after authored map collision
changes. Any gameplay authority added here must also run the shared `src/net`
tests, deterministic match tests, abuse cases, and real WebSocket soak/load tests.
