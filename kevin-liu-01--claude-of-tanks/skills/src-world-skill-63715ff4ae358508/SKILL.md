## Purpose
<!-- agent-docs:fill:purpose -->
Own deterministic battlefield geometry, collision queries, destruction, LOD,
and map presentation.

## Mental model & key files
<!-- agent-docs:fill:model -->
`worldBuildCoordinator.ts` owns map transfer, construction joins, background
pacing, cancellation, residency, and eviction. `worldActivationRuntime.ts`
owns the single active battlefield, atmosphere re-keying, collider/minimap
readiness, covered GPU warm, dormancy, and activation telemetry. `map.ts` composes maps,
`worldFramePresentationRuntime.ts` owns scoped foliage suppression and the
allocation-free chase-camera occlusion focus passed to an active world,
`terrain.js` provides the height field and world-local shared LOD index pools,
`terrainLodPolicy.ts` owns typed allocation-free visible/prefetch scheduling,
`liveHeightFieldProxy.ts` selects cached live versus exact authoring queries,
`collision.ts` owns strict allocation-free broad phase and narrow-phase shape
contracts, `maps/` owns layouts, and vegetation,
props and toppling own their visual/runtime layers; `wrecks.ts` owns typed,
deterministic static tank-wreck and zero-extra-draw-call debris baking.
`destructibles.ts` is the typed, allocation-free active-world seam between
shell traffic, break FX, prop destruction events, and cached map handlers.
`utilityNetwork.ts` owns renderer-free pole adjacency, hinge poses, stable
conductor instance slots, and caller-buffer catenary sampling.
`topple.ts` and `treeGrounding.ts` own typed terrain-contact fall math and
bounded root decals without bringing Three.js into either policy.
`propGeometry.ts` owns shared UV-safe primitives and the low-triangle telephone
pole distance representation; callers dispose or transfer every returned mesh.
`propPlacement.ts` owns typed terrain-support, rigid-footprint, utility-pole,
segment, and compound-obstacle placement during world construction.
`structureConnectivity.ts` rejects unsupported authored parts before batching;
`structureInstanceAppearance.ts` supplies stable intact/wreck instance tint
without creating per-building materials.
`propsModelStore.ts` owns the bounds-checked packed runtime representation of
the attributed `props-models.json` authoring source; regenerate it with
`npm run world:props:pack` after intentional source changes.
`structureCollision.ts` keeps projection/key caches construction-local. Any
optimization must retain exact polygon order and runtime/authoring output;
numeric inputs outside the certified raster-bounds domain use the original
predicate path. Static wreck baking alone may omit the default-on factory ERA
audit receipt; it must retain ERA geometry, seating and cluster ownership.
`headlessCollisionWorld.ts` owns the typed inflation and query facade for exact
authored collision records on a dedicated server without importing renderer or
DOM state.
`loosePropPhysics.ts` owns deterministic fixed-step impulses, terrain support,
sleep, static contact, and pair response for lightweight battlefield dressing.

## Patterns to follow / invariants
<!-- agent-docs:fill:patterns -->
Keep height/collision queries deterministic and headless-capable. Bound per-frame
LOD/vegetation work, reuse world caches, and reset destruction on rematch.
Garage vegetation may reuse battlefield-near tree geometry only as static,
instanced scenery with no world update loop. Its headless audit path must remain
DOM-free. Share its immutable species groves across cached environment packs,
split cold grove preparation across rendered frames, and dispose each generated
foliage atlas with the owning library. Each Garage horizon must follow the source
biome rather than reuse a universal mountain wall.
Certify structure connectivity before material-bucket or instanced-geometry
merges; merged geometry is too late to identify a floating authored fixture.
Keep facade depth inside existing material buckets and repeated-building
variation inside instance attributes. Never clone a material per placement or
add a steady-frame structure update solely for cosmetic variety.
Keep large baked numeric streams out of executable chunks. Start their bounded
transfer with explicit Battle intent, overlap it with independent construction,
and verify the packed representation against its authoring source.
World meshes authored only as low-polygon shadow casters must use
`markShadowOnly()` from `src/engine/renderLayers.ts`; keep visible geometry on
the presentation layer and verify that native shadow submissions are unchanged.
Terrain position/normal buffers remain chunk-local, but identical LOD topology
must share one Uint16 index attribute per resolution within each world.
Register off-tree streamed LOD geometries with the world root's retained
resource lifetime so cache eviction can dispose them.
The same ownership declaration must cover shader-only textures, custom depth
materials, empty CSM-registered buckets and inactive grass LOD variants. GPU
suspension preserves reusable CPU data; final eviction also releases external
destruction callbacks via the world's disposer. Register those callbacks only
after complete assembly, and make disposal identity-safe across same-ID rebuilds.
Use the warmed one-metre height cache for live non-authoring presentation. Keep
the analytic sampler for deterministic captures and construction receipts.
Deferred grass may prepare only a half-chunk beyond its unchanged fade band;
larger invisible lookahead jobs steal CPU from the opening drive.
Keep active-world state inside `worldActivationRuntime.ts`; browser callers
must use its `ensure`, `switchMap`, `prepareBattleServices`, and `setDormant`
interface rather than recreating activation order or retaining parallel map IDs.

## Common tasks → first action
<!-- agent-docs:fill:tasks -->
Identify the canonical height/collision source, add a focused world selftest,
then inspect every registered map and constrained-device frame metrics. Regenerate
the server collision manifest after changing authored obstacles or cover.

## Gotchas
<!-- agent-docs:fill:gotchas -->
The garage keeps the battle world dormant. Do not wake or build heavy map work
on the garage boot path. AI navigation must use traversability, not visuals.
