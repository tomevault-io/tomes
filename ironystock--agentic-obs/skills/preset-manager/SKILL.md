# Preset Manager

Expert guidance for managing scene presets in OBS Studio, enabling quick switching between saved source visibility configurations.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate the **preset-manager** skill when users request help with:

- **Creating presets**
  - "Save this layout"
  - "Create a preset for my current setup"
  - "Remember these source settings"
  - "Save my gaming configuration"

- **Applying presets**
  - "Apply my BRB preset"
  - "Switch to gaming mode"
  - "Load my starting configuration"
  - "Use my interview preset"

- **Listing and viewing presets**
  - "What presets do I have?"
  - "Show my saved presets"
  - "What's in my gaming preset?"
  - "Preview preset changes"

- **Managing presets**
  - "Rename my preset"
  - "Delete old presets"
  - "Organize my presets"
  - "Update my preset"

- **Preset workflows**
  - "Set up quick switching"
  - "Create presets for my stream"
  - "Automate scene changes"

## Core Responsibilities

As the **preset-manager**, your role is to:

1. **Create presets** from current scene configurations
2. **Apply presets** to restore saved source visibility states
3. **List presets** with filtering by scene
4. **Preview presets** before applying
5. **Rename presets** for better organization
6. **Delete presets** that are no longer needed
7. **Guide preset strategy** for efficient workflows

## Available Tools

### Preset Operations
- `save_scene_preset` - Save current scene's source visibility as a preset
- `apply_scene_preset` - Apply a saved preset to restore source visibility
- `get_preset_details` - View what a preset contains before applying
- `list_scene_presets` - List all presets, optionally filtered by scene
- `rename_scene_preset` - Rename an existing preset
- `delete_scene_preset` - Remove a preset permanently

### Supporting Tools
- `list_scenes` - View available scenes
- `list_sources` - View sources in a scene
- `toggle_source_visibility` - Manually adjust visibility if needed

## What Presets Store

A preset captures:
- **Scene name**: Which scene the preset belongs to
- **Source visibility states**: For each source, whether it's visible or hidden
- **Creation timestamp**: When the preset was saved

A preset does NOT store:
- Source positions or transforms
- Source settings or configurations
- Audio levels or mute states
- Scene order or structure

## Preset Naming Conventions

### Recommended Format
```
[Scene]-[Purpose]-[Variant]
```

### Examples
```
Gaming-Stream-Full        # Gaming scene, all sources visible
Gaming-Focus-NoChat       # Gaming scene, chat hidden
Starting-Countdown-5min   # Starting scene with 5-min countdown
BRB-Quick                 # Quick BRB with minimal elements
Interview-TwoCamera       # Interview with both cameras
```

### Good Naming Practices
- Include scene name for clarity
- Describe the configuration purpose
- Use consistent naming patterns
- Avoid special characters
- Keep names reasonably short

## Preset Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Current State

```
Before saving:
1. Use list_sources to see current visibility
2. Confirm this is the desired configuration
3. Note any sources that need adjustment
```

### Step 2: Adjust if Needed

```
If changes needed:
1. Use toggle_source_visibility to show/hide sources
2. Verify final state with list_sources
```

### Step 3: Save the Preset

```
1. Use save_scene_preset with:
   - preset_name: Descriptive name
   - scene_name: Current scene
2. Confirm save with list_scene_presets
```

### Example: Creating a Gaming Preset

```
User: "Save my current gaming layout"

1. Verify scene:
   - Use list_scenes to confirm current scene is "Gaming"

2. Check current sources:
   - Use list_sources for "Gaming" scene
   - Report:
     - Webcam: Visible
     - Game Capture: Visible
     - Chat Overlay: Hidden
     - Alerts: Visible

3. Confirm with user:
   - "Your Gaming scene has: Webcam, Game Capture, and Alerts visible. Chat is hidden."
   - "Save this as a preset?"

4. Save preset:
   - save_scene_preset:
     - preset_name: "Gaming-Stream-NoChat"
     - scene_name: "Gaming"

5. Confirm:
   - "Saved preset 'Gaming-Stream-NoChat' with current source visibility"
```

## Preset Application Workflow

### Step 1: Preview the Preset

```
Before applying:
1. Use get_preset_details to see what will change
2. Report visibility changes to user
3. Confirm they want to proceed
```

### Step 2: Apply the Preset

```
1. Use apply_scene_preset with preset name
2. Report what changed
```

### Step 3: Verify Application

```
1. Use list_sources to confirm new state
2. Report final visibility status
```

### Example: Applying a Preset

```
User: "Switch to my BRB setup"

1. Find the preset:
   - Use list_scene_presets
   - Locate: "BRB-Quick"

2. Preview changes:
   - Use get_preset_details for "BRB-Quick"
   - Report:
     - Scene: BRB
     - Sources to show: BRB Screen, Background Music
     - Sources to hide: Webcam, Game Capture

3. Confirm:
   - "Applying 'BRB-Quick' will show BRB Screen and Background Music, hide Webcam and Game Capture. Proceed?"

4. Apply:
   - Use apply_scene_preset: "BRB-Quick"

5. Confirm:
   - "Applied 'BRB-Quick' preset"
   - "BRB Screen and Background Music now visible"
```

## Preset Management

### Listing Presets

```
User: "What presets do I have?"

1. Use list_scene_presets (no filter for all)
2. Report:
   - Gaming-Stream-Full (Gaming scene)
   - Gaming-Focus-NoChat (Gaming scene)
   - BRB-Quick (BRB scene)
   - Starting-Countdown (Starting Soon scene)
   - Ending-Credits (Ending scene)
```

### Filtering by Scene

```
User: "Show presets for my Gaming scene"

1. Use list_scene_presets with scene_name: "Gaming"
2. Report:
   - Gaming-Stream-Full
   - Gaming-Focus-NoChat
   - Gaming-Commentary
```

### Renaming Presets

```
User: "Rename 'Gaming-Stream-Full' to 'Gaming-Everything'"

1. Use rename_scene_preset:
   - old_name: "Gaming-Stream-Full"
   - new_name: "Gaming-Everything"

2. Confirm:
   - "Renamed 'Gaming-Stream-Full' to 'Gaming-Everything'"
```

### Deleting Presets

```
User: "Delete my old 'Test-Preset'"

1. Confirm:
   - "Are you sure you want to delete 'Test-Preset'? This cannot be undone."

2. If confirmed, use delete_scene_preset:
   - preset_name: "Test-Preset"

3. Confirm:
   - "Deleted preset 'Test-Preset'"
```

## Preset Strategy for Streamers

### Recommended Preset Collection

#### Per-Scene Presets
```
For each scene, consider:
1. [Scene]-Full - All sources visible
2. [Scene]-Minimal - Only essential sources
3. [Scene]-Focused - Key content only (no overlays)
```

#### Workflow Presets
```
Streaming workflow:
1. Starting-Countdown - Pre-stream state
2. Gaming-Stream - Active gaming setup
3. Just-Chatting - Conversation mode
4. BRB-Quick - Brief away state
5. Ending-Credits - End-of-stream state
```

#### Special Purpose Presets
```
For specific moments:
1. Sponsor-Spotlight - Sponsor visibility
2. Raid-Welcome - Raid celebration overlay
3. Giveaway-Active - Giveaway overlay visible
4. Technical-Difficulty - Error/issue screen
```

### Preset Organization Tips

```
1. Use consistent naming conventions
2. Group by scene name prefix
3. Indicate purpose in name
4. Delete unused presets regularly
5. Test presets before going live
```

## Example Workflows

### Example 1: Complete Preset Setup for New Streamer

**User Request**: "Help me set up presets for my stream"

**Response Pattern**:
```
1. "Let me help you create a preset system..."

2. Inventory scenes:

```

## Best Practices

### Before Creating Presets
```
1. Set up your scene exactly as desired
2. Verify all source visibility
3. Test the configuration
4. Choose a descriptive name
```

### Before Applying Presets
```
1. Preview with get_preset_details
2. Confirm this is the right preset
3. Be aware of what will change
4. Have a fallback plan
```

### Preset Maintenance
```
1. Review presets periodically
2. Delete unused presets
3. Update presets when scenes change
4. Rename for clarity as needed
```

### Naming Discipline
```
1. Be consistent with naming format
2. Include scene name for context
3. Describe the purpose/state
4. Avoid cryptic abbreviations
```

## Troubleshooting

### Preset won't apply
```
Possible causes:
1. Preset references deleted sources - check preset details
2. Scene was renamed - preset may be orphaned
3. Typo in preset name - verify with list_scene_presets

Solution:
- If sources missing, create new preset
- If scene renamed, create new preset for new scene
- Use exact name from list
```

### Wrong sources affected
```
Possible causes:
1. Preset was saved with wrong visibility
2. Sources were added after preset creation
3. Applied to wrong scene

Solution:
- Preview with get_preset_details before applying
- Update preset by saving again with correct state
- New sources need explicit preset update
```

### Preset seems empty
```
Possible causes:
1. Scene had no sources when saved
2. Preset corrupted

Solution:
- Check scene has sources: list_sources
- Delete and recreate the preset
```

## Integration with Other Skills

The **preset-manager** skill may collaborate with:

- **streaming-assistant**: For preset-based scene transitions during streams
- **scene-designer**: After designing a layout, save it as a preset
- **audio-engineer**: Note that presets don't save audio states

**Handoff Pattern**:
```
User: "Design a new BRB scene and save it"

preset-manager: "Let me connect you with scene-designer
to create the layout first, then we'll save it as a preset..."

[Handoff to scene-designer, then return for preset save]
```

## Preset Limitations

Remember that presets only store **source visibility**:

```
Presets DO save:
- Which sources are visible/hidden
- The scene the preset belongs to

Presets DON'T save:
- Source positions/transforms
- Source settings (URLs, file paths, etc.)
- Audio levels or mute states
- Scene switching (they apply within a scene)
```

For complete state management, combine with:
- Manual source configuration
- Audio level presets (if implemented)
- Scene switching tools

## Summary

The **preset-manager** skill is your configuration efficiency expert for OBS Studio. It provides:

- Preset creation from current scene state
- Quick preset application for scene transitions
- Preset preview before applying
- Organization with listing, renaming, deletion
- Strategy guidance for preset systems

Use presets to enable instant switching between configurations, reducing manual source toggling during streams. Create a complete preset system during setup, then enjoy one-command configuration changes during live content.
