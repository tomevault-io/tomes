- `get_obs_status` - Overall OBS status including audio info

## Audio Level Reference

### Decibel (dB) Scale

| Level | Description | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| 0 dB | Maximum (clipping risk) | Never target |
| -3 dB | Very loud (occasional peaks) | Loud moments only |
| -6 dB | Loud (safe peak level) | Maximum peaks |
| -12 dB | Normal speaking | Voice target |
| -18 dB | Background audio | Music, game audio |
| -24 dB | Quiet background | Ambient, low music |
| -30 dB | Very quiet | Barely audible |
| -inf dB | Silent | Muted/no signal |

### Ideal Levels by Source Type

| Source Type | Target Peak | Target Average |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Microphone (voice) | -6 dB | -12 to -18 dB |
| Game audio | -12 dB | -18 to -24 dB |
| Music/background | -18 dB | -24 to -30 dB |
| Alert sounds | -12 dB | -18 dB |
| Discord/voice chat | -12 dB | -18 dB |

## Audio Check Workflow

When users request an audio check, follow this systematic approach:

### Step 1: Identify Audio Sources

```
1. Use list_sources to enumerate all sources
2. Identify audio inputs (microphone, desktop audio, etc.)
3. Report found audio sources to user
```

### Step 2: Check Mute Status

```
For each audio source:
1. Use get_input_mute
2. Report: "[Source]: Muted/Unmuted"
3. Flag any sources that should be unmuted but aren't
```

### Step 3: Check Volume Levels

```
For each audio source:
1. Use get_input_volume
2. Report: "[Source]: [X] dB"
3. Compare against ideal levels for source type
4. Flag any levels outside recommended range
```

### Step 4: Provide Recommendations

```
Based on findings:
- Suggest volume adjustments with specific dB values
- Recommend muting unused sources
- Warn about potential issues (levels too high/low)
```

## Volume Adjustment Workflows

### Setting Specific dB Level

```
User: "Set my mic to -10 dB"

1. Use set_input_volume:
   - input_name: "Microphone" (or user's mic name)
   - volume_db: -10

2. Verify with get_input_volume

3. Confirm: "Microphone set to -10 dB"
```

### Relative Adjustments

```
User: "Make my mic a bit louder"

1. Get current level:
   - Use get_input_volume
   - Example result: -18 dB

2. Calculate new level:
   - "A bit louder" = +3 to +6 dB
   - New target: -12 dB

3. Apply adjustment:
   - set_input_volume: -12 dB

4. Confirm: "Increased microphone from -18 dB to -12 dB"
```

### Balancing Multiple Sources

```
User: "Balance my mic and game audio"

1. Get current levels:
   - Microphone: -10 dB
   - Game Audio: -8 dB

2. Analyze:
   - Both levels similar = mic may get drowned out
   - Voice should be 6-12 dB louder than game

3. Recommend:
   - Keep mic at -10 dB
   - Lower game to -18 dB (8 dB difference)

4. Apply if approved:
   - set_input_volume for Game Audio: -18 dB

5. Confirm: "Game audio lowered to -18 dB for better voice clarity"
```

## Mute Management

### Quick Mute Check

```
User: "Is my mic muted?"

1. Use get_input_mute for microphone
2. Report: "Your microphone is [muted/unmuted]"
```

### Toggle Mute

```
User: "Mute my mic"

1. Use toggle_input_mute for microphone
2. Verify with get_input_mute
3. Confirm: "Microphone is now muted"
```

### Bulk Mute Status

```
User: "What's muted?"

For each audio source:
1. get_input_mute
2. Compile list

Report:
- Microphone: Unmuted
- Desktop Audio: Unmuted
- Browser Audio: Muted
- Game Capture: Unmuted
```

## Common Audio Issues

### Issue: Voice Too Quiet

**Symptoms**: Viewers say they can't hear you well

**Diagnosis**:
```
1. get_input_volume for microphone
2. If below -18 dB, likely too quiet
```

**Fix**:
```
1. Increase to -10 to -12 dB
2. set_input_volume with new value
3. Ask user to test
```

### Issue: Audio Clipping/Distortion

**Symptoms**: Audio sounds crunchy or distorted

**Diagnosis**:
```
1. get_input_volume - check if close to 0 dB
2. High levels = likely clipping
```

**Fix**:
```
1. Reduce volume by 6-10 dB
2. Target -12 dB for voice
3. set_input_volume with lower value
```

### Issue: Game Audio Drowning Voice

**Symptoms**: Voice hard to hear over game

**Diagnosis**:
```
1. Compare mic and game levels
2. If within 6 dB of each other, game is too loud
```

**Fix**:
```
1. Lower game audio to -18 to -24 dB
2. Keep mic at -10 to -12 dB
3. 6-12 dB difference is ideal
```

### Issue: Echo/Feedback

**Symptoms**: Viewers hear themselves or echo

**Possible Causes**:
```
1. Desktop audio capturing speaker output
2. Monitoring enabled on wrong device
3. Discord or other apps playing back audio
```

**Recommendations**:
```
1. Check desktop audio isn't capturing speakers
2. Suggest user check OBS audio monitoring settings
3. Recommend push-to-talk or noise gate in Discord
```

### Issue: No Audio

**Symptoms**: Complete silence from a source

**Diagnosis**:
```
1. get_input_mute - check if muted
2. get_input_volume - check if -inf dB
3. Verify source exists with list_sources
```

**Fix**:
```
1. If muted, toggle_input_mute
2. If -inf, suggest checking OBS audio settings
3. If source missing, guide user to add it in OBS
```

## Professional Audio Tips

### Voice Clarity

```
Recommended voice setup:
- Target: -12 dB average, -6 dB peaks
- Be the loudest source (6+ dB above others)
- Consistent distance from microphone
```

### Game Audio Balance

```
Game audio recommendations:
- Target: -18 to -24 dB
- Should be clearly audible but not overpowering
- Reduce during commentary-heavy moments
```

### Music/Background Audio

```
Background music:
- Target: -24 to -30 dB
- Should be subtle, not distracting
- Lower during speaking
```

### Alert Sounds

```
Alert audio:
- Target: -12 to -18 dB
- Should be noticeable but not jarring
- Brief and clear
```

   - "Please test with your viewers"
```

### Example 3: Balancing Voice Chat

**User Request**: "My Discord is too loud compared to me"

**Response Pattern**:
```
1. "Let me check your audio balance..."

2. Get levels:
   - Microphone: -12 dB
   - Discord/Voice Chat: -8 dB

3. Analyze:
   - "Discord at -8 dB is 4 dB louder than your mic at -12 dB"
   - "Your voice should be the loudest, not Discord"

4. Recommend:
   - "I suggest lowering Discord to -18 dB"
   - "This puts your voice 6 dB louder than chat"

5. Apply fix:
   - set_input_volume for Discord: -18 dB

   - "Microphone: Unmuted, -5 dB (TOO LOUD - clipping risk)"
   - "Desktop Audio: Unmuted, -10 dB (loud)"
   - "Game Capture: Muted"
   - "Browser Source: Unmuted, -15 dB"

4. Identify issues:
   - "Your microphone at -5 dB is too hot - likely causing distortion"
   - "Desktop audio at -10 dB may compete with your voice"

5. Propose fixes:
   - "Lower microphone to -12 dB"
   - "Lower desktop to -18 dB"
   - "Unmute game capture if you want game audio"

6. Apply approved fixes:
   - set_input_volume for Microphone: -12 dB
   - set_input_volume for Desktop Audio: -18 dB

7. Confirm:
   - "Audio rebalanced:"
   - "Mic: -12 dB (no more clipping)"
   - "Desktop: -18 dB (proper background level)"
   - "Should sound much cleaner now!"
```

## Best Practices

### Always Verify Changes
```
After any set_input_volume:
1. Use get_input_volume to confirm
2. Report actual value to user
3. Ask for real-world test
```

### Incremental Adjustments
```
For fine-tuning:
- Make 3 dB adjustments at a time
- Verify with user feedback
- Iterate until satisfied
```

### Document Current State
```
Before making changes:
- Note current levels
- Enable rollback if needed
- "Your mic was at -18 dB, now at -12 dB"
```

### Consider the Mix
```
When adjusting one source:
- Check how it relates to others
- Maintain proper hierarchy
- Voice > Game > Music
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Can't find audio source
```
1. Use list_sources to see all sources
2. Audio inputs have specific names
3. Common names: "Mic/Aux", "Desktop Audio", "Audio Output Capture"
4. Ask user for exact source name if unclear
```

### Volume won't change
```
1. Verify source name is correct (case-sensitive)
2. Check OBS audio monitoring isn't overriding
3. Suggest user check OBS audio mixer
```

### Unexpected mute behavior
```
1. OBS has multiple mute points (mixer, advanced audio)
2. toggle_input_mute affects the main mixer mute
3. If mute seems stuck, suggest checking OBS UI
```
