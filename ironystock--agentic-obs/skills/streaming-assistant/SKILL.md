## Pre-Stream Workflow

When users request pre-stream setup, follow this systematic checklist:

### Step 1: Verify OBS Connection
```
1. Use get_obs_status to confirm OBS is connected and responsive
2. Report OBS version and connection status
3. If disconnected, guide user to check OBS is running and WebSocket is enabled
```

### Step 2: Scene Inventory
```
1. Use list_scenes to enumerate all available scenes
2. Identify the starting scene (usually provided by user)
3. Confirm current scene matches intended starting scene
4. If not, use set_current_scene to switch
```

### Step 3: Source Verification
```
1. Use list_sources (optionally filtered by starting scene)
2. Identify key sources (camera, game capture, overlays, etc.)
3. Verify critical sources are visible
4. Hide any sources that should not appear at stream start
```

### Step 4: Audio Check
```
1. Use list_sources to identify all audio inputs
2. For each audio source:
   - Use get_input_mute to verify unmuted (if should be active)
   - Use get_input_volume to check levels are appropriate
3. Recommend adjustments if levels too low (<-30 dB) or too high (>-6 dB)
4. Suggest user speaks/plays content for real-world verification
```

### Step 5: Preset Confirmation
```
1. Use list_scene_presets to show available presets
2. Ask if user wants to apply a specific preset for stream start
3. Use get_preset_details to preview what will change
4. Apply with apply_scene_preset if confirmed
```

### Step 6: Final Checklist
```
Present a summary:
- OBS Status: Connected, OBS vX.X.X
- Starting Scene: [Scene Name]
- Active Sources: [List visible sources]
- Audio Inputs: [List with mute/volume status]
- Preset Applied: [Preset name or "None"]
- Ready to stream: YES/NO
```

### Step 7: Stream Start
```

```

### Audio Adjustments
```
User: "My mic is too quiet"
1. Use get_input_volume to check current level
2. Calculate recommended increase (+3 to +6 dB typical)
3. Use set_input_volume to adjust
4. Use get_input_volume to confirm new level
5. Ask user to test and iterate if needed
```

### Health Monitoring
```
User: "Is my stream okay?"
1. Use get_streaming_status to check stream is active
2. Report stream duration, data transferred, frame stats
3. Use get_obs_status for overall health
4. Check for any dropped frames or issues in stats
5. Provide brief health summary
```

### Virtual Camera Management
```

2. If not active, use toggle_virtual_cam to start
3. Confirm: "Virtual camera is now active"
4. Inform: "You can select 'OBS Virtual Camera' in Discord/Zoom/Teams"

User: "Stop the virtual camera"
1. Use toggle_virtual_cam to stop
2. Confirm: "Virtual camera stopped"
```

### Highlight Capture with Replay Buffer
```
User: "I want to capture highlights"
1. Use get_replay_buffer_status to check if running
2. If not active, use toggle_replay_buffer to start
3. Confirm: "Replay buffer is now active"
4. Inform: "Say 'save that' or 'clip it' to capture last N seconds"

User: "That was epic! Clip it!"
1. Use save_replay_buffer to capture

2. Use trigger_hotkey_by_name with "OBSBasic.Screenshot"
3. Confirm: "Screenshot captured"
```

## Post-Stream Workflow

When users request stream teardown:

### Step 1: Confirm Stream Stop
```
1. Use get_streaming_status to verify stream is still active
2. Ask user to confirm they want to end stream
3. Use stop_streaming
4. Confirm stream stopped with get_streaming_status
```

### Step 2: Summary Statistics
```
1. Report final stream duration
2. Report total data transferred
3. Highlight any notable stats (dropped frames, etc.)
```

### Step 3: Cleanup Recommendations
```
Suggest:
- Reviewing stream recording if enabled
- Switching to a neutral scene
- Muting audio inputs if finished
- Stopping replay buffer if running (toggle_replay_buffer)
- Stopping virtual camera if active (toggle_virtual_cam)
- Disabling studio mode if enabled (toggle_studio_mode)
- Applying a "Stream Ended" preset if available
```

## Best Practices

### Pre-Stream Checklist Thoroughness
- Always check audio mute status AND volume levels
- Verify the correct starting scene is active
- List visible sources to catch accidental overlays
- Offer preset application for consistent configurations

### Communication During Streaming
- Keep responses concise during active streams
- Confirm all actions immediately
- Proactively suggest next steps for common transitions
- Warn before major changes (scene switches, preset applications)

### Audio Management
- Ideal speaking levels: -12 to -6 dB (good modulation)
- Music/game audio: -20 to -12 dB (background mix)
- Alert for levels consistently above -3 dB (clipping risk)
- Alert for levels below -30 dB (too quiet)

### Scene Transitions
- Confirm scene switch completed before suggesting source changes
- List sources in new scene to orient user
- Offer to apply relevant presets after scene change

### Error Handling
- If stream start fails, suggest checking stream key and platform settings
- If scene not found, use list_scenes to show available options
- If source not found, use list_sources to enumerate possibilities
- If audio source not found, list audio inputs specifically

### Preset Integration
- Offer preset application during pre-stream setup
- Suggest creating presets for repeated configurations
- Use get_preset_details before applying for transparency
- Explain what will change when applying preset

## Example Workflows

   - Report: "Duration: 1h 23m"
   - Report: "Data transferred: 2.3 GB"
   - Report: "Frames: 150,000 total, 5 dropped (0.003%)"

2. "Checking overall OBS health..."
   - Use get_obs_status
   - Report: "OBS is responsive, no issues detected"

3. "Stream health: EXCELLENT"
   - "Your stream is running smoothly with minimal dropped frames."
   - "Data rate is consistent, no connection issues detected."
```

### Example 5: Preset-Based Scene Transition

**User Request**: "Switch to my BRB setup"

**Response Pattern**:
```
1. "Checking available presets..."
   - Use list_scene_presets
   - Found: "BRB Setup" preset

2. "Previewing 'BRB Setup' preset..."
   - Use get_preset_details
   - Report: "This preset will:"
     - "Scene: BRB (switch from current scene)"
     - "Show: BRB Screen, Chill Music"
     - "Hide: Webcam, Game Capture"

3. "Applying 'BRB Setup' preset..."
   - Use apply_scene_preset
   - Confirm: "Applied successfully"

4. "You're now in BRB mode. Your stream shows the BRB screen with chill music."
   - Reminder: "Use 'switch to gaming preset' when you're back."
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Skipping audio verification**: Always check both mute status AND volume levels
2. **Not confirming scene switches**: Use list_scenes or get_obs_status to verify
3. **Ignoring presets**: Presets are powerful for consistent configurations
4. **Vague source names**: Ask for clarification if source name is ambiguous
5. **Starting stream without verification**: Always run through checklist first
6. **Not providing feedback**: Confirm every action during active streams
7. **Overcomplicating simple requests**: "Hide webcam" is one tool call, keep it simple

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Stream won't start
```
1. Use get_obs_status to verify OBS connection
2. Check streaming_status for any error messages
3. Suggest user verify stream key and platform settings in OBS
4. Confirm internet connection is stable
```

### Audio source not responding
```
1. Use list_sources to verify source exists
2. Check exact source name (case-sensitive)
3. Use get_input_mute to check if muted
4. Suggest user check OBS audio mixer for device detection
```

### Scene switch doesn't work
```
1. Use list_scenes to verify scene exists
2. Check exact scene name (case-sensitive)
3. Use set_current_scene with correct name
4. Verify switch with get_obs_status (reports current scene)
```

### Preset application fails
```
1. Use list_scene_presets to verify preset exists
2. Use get_preset_details to check preset is valid
3. Verify scene referenced in preset still exists
4. Check sources in preset still exist in OBS
```
