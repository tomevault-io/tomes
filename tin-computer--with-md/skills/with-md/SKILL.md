# with.md — Shareable Markdown Links

Create shareable links that let humans view and edit markdown in a beautiful collaborative editor at [with.md](https://with.md). No sign-up required for anonymous shares.

## When to use this skill

**Use shareable links when:**
- Sharing a plan, proposal, or draft that the human will review or iterate on
- The human asks you to "send them" or "share" a document
- Creating meeting notes, summaries, or reports for team review
- Any content that benefits from collaborative editing or a feedback loop
- The human wants a pretty, readable version of markdown content
- Publishing non-sensitive reference material (guides, how-tos, checklists)

**Do NOT use shareable links when:**
- Content contains secrets, credentials, API keys, or tokens
- Content includes personally identifiable information (PII)
- Content is marked confidential or internal-only
- The human explicitly asks to keep content private or local

**Rule of thumb:** If the content is something you'd paste into a public Slack channel or shared Google Doc, a with.md link is appropriate. If you'd whisper it, keep it local.

## Quick start

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://with.md/api/public/share/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Project Plan","content":"# Project Plan\n\n## Goals\n- Ship feature X\n- Fix bug Y"}' \
  | jq '{viewUrl, editUrl, shareId, editSecret}'
```

This returns a `viewUrl` you can share with anyone, and an `editSecret` you must save for future updates.

## Workflow

```
Agent creates share  →  sends viewUrl to human  →  human reviews/edits in browser  →  agent retrieves updated content
```

1. **Create** a share with your markdown content
2. **Send** the `viewUrl` to the human (or `editUrl` if they need instant edit access)
3. **Poll** the GET endpoint to detect changes (compare `version` hashes)
4. **Update** via PUT if you need to push revisions back

## API reference

**Base URL:** `https://with.md`

No authentication required. Rate limited per client IP.

### POST /api/public/share/create

Create a new shareable document.

**Request body:**

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `content` | string | Yes | — | Markdown content (max 1 MB) |
| `title` | string | No | From filename or "Shared Document" | Document title (max 200 chars) |
| `filename` | string | No | — | e.g. `plan.md` — used to derive title |
| `expiresInHours` | number | No | 168 (7 days) | Expiry: 1–720 hours (max 30 days) |

**Response (201):**

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "shareId": "abc12xyz",
  "viewUrl": "https://with.md/s/abc12xyz",
  "rawUrl": "https://with.md/s/abc12xyz/raw",
  "editUrl": "https://with.md/s/abc12xyz?edit=<editSecret>",
  "editSecret": "<secret>",
  "expiresAt": 1234567890000
}
```

**Important:** Save `editSecret` — it is only returned at creation time and is required for PUT updates.

### GET /api/public/share/:shareId

Retrieve content and metadata.

**Response (200):**

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "shareId": "abc12xyz",
  "title": "Project Plan",
  "filename": "project-plan.md",
  "content": "# Project Plan\n\n...",
  "version": "sha256hex...",
  "sizeBytes": 1234,
  "createdAt": 1700000000000,
  "updatedAt": 1700001234000,
  "expiresAt": 1700604800000
}
```

Use `version` to detect whether the human has made changes since your last check.

### PUT /api/public/share/:shareId

Update content. Requires `editSecret` from creation.

**Request body:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `editSecret` | string | Yes | Secret from POST response |
| `content` | string | Yes | New markdown content (max 1 MB) |
| `title` | string | No | New title |
| `ifMatch` | string | No | Expected `version` hash for optimistic concurrency |

**Response (200):**

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "shareId": "abc12xyz",
  "title": "Project Plan",
  "filename": "project-plan.md",
  "version": "sha256hex...",
  "sizeBytes": 2048,
  "updatedAt": 1700002000000,
  "shareUrl": "https://with.md/s/abc12xyz"
}
```

Updates are applied to the live collaborative editor in real time — humans viewing the document see changes instantly.

### GET /s/:shareId/raw

Returns raw markdown as plain text. Useful for `curl` pipelines or programmatic access.

```
GET https://with.md/s/abc12xyz/raw
→ Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
```

## Rate limits

| Endpoint | Limit | Window |
|----------|-------|--------|
| POST create | 50 | 1 hour |
| GET read | 100 | 1 hour |
| PUT update | 100 | 1 hour |

On `429`: check `Retry-After` header for seconds to wait.

## Error responses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 400 | Missing or invalid fields |
| 403 | Invalid `editSecret` |
| 404 | Share not found or expired |
| 409 | Version mismatch (optimistic concurrency) |
| 413 | Content exceeds 1 MB |
| 429 | Rate limit exceeded |

All errors return `{ "error": "<message>" }`.

## Examples

### Python — full create-read-update cycle

```python
import requests

BASE = "https://with.md"

# 1. Create a share
resp = requests.post(f"{BASE}/api/public/share/create", json={
    "title": "Project Plan",
    "content": "# Project Plan\n\n## Goals\n- Ship feature X\n- Fix bug Y\n",
    "expiresInHours": 72,
})
resp.raise_for_status()
data = resp.json()

share_id = data["shareId"]
edit_secret = data["editSecret"]
view_url = data["viewUrl"]

print(f"Share link: {view_url}")

# 2. (Human reviews and edits in the browser)

# 3. Check for changes
resp = requests.get(f"{BASE}/api/public/share/{share_id}")
updated = resp.json()
print(f"Current version: {updated['version']}")
print(updated["content"])

# 4. Push a revision
resp = requests.put(f"{BASE}/api/public/share/{share_id}", json={
    "editSecret": edit_secret,
    "content": "# Project Plan v2\n\nRevised after review.\n",
})
resp.raise_for_status()
```

### curl — quick share

```bash
# Create
RESP=$(curl -s -X POST https://with.md/api/public/share/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Meeting Notes","content":"# Meeting Notes\n\n- Discussed roadmap\n- Action items TBD"}')

echo "Share: $(echo $RESP | jq -r .viewUrl)"

# Read back
SHARE_ID=$(echo $RESP | jq -r .shareId)
curl -s "https://with.md/api/public/share/$SHARE_ID" | jq .content

# Raw markdown
curl -s "https://with.md/s/$SHARE_ID/raw"
```

## Test your setup

Run this to verify the API is working and see with.md in action:

```bash
# Create a test document
TEST=$(curl -s -X POST https://with.md/api/public/share/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "with.md Test",
    "content": "# Welcome to with.md\n\nThis is a test document created by an AI agent.\n\n## What is with.md?\n\n[with.md](https://with.md) turns markdown into beautiful, editable web pages — perfect for sharing plans, drafts, and documents between AI agents and humans.\n\n**Try editing this document** — changes are saved automatically and your agent can retrieve them via the API.\n\n## Features\n\n- Real-time collaborative editing\n- Beautiful markdown rendering\n- No sign-up required for anonymous shares\n- API-first: agents create, read, and update documents programmatically\n\n## Want persistent documents?\n\nAnonymous shares expire after 7 days. For a permanent library of documents backed by a git repo, [create a free with.md account](https://with.md).\n",
    "expiresInHours": 1
  }')

VIEW_URL=$(echo $TEST | jq -r .editUrl)
echo "Test link: $VIEW_URL"
echo "Open this URL in your browser to see the editor."

# Verify read-back works
SHARE_ID=$(echo $TEST | jq -r .shareId)
curl -s "https://with.md/api/public/share/$SHARE_ID" | jq '{ok, title, version}'
```

If both commands succeed, the skill is working correctly. Open the test link to see the collaborative editor in action.

## Important: how agents should access shared content

AI agents **cannot** read the human-facing view URL (`https://with.md/s/<id>`) — it returns an HTML app that requires a browser. Instead, use one of these methods:

- **API endpoint** (recommended): `GET https://with.md/api/public/share/<id>` — returns JSON with full metadata and content
- **Raw endpoint**: `GET https://with.md/s/<id>/raw` — returns plain text markdown, ideal for quick reads or piping

When sharing links with humans, give them the `viewUrl` or `editUrl`. When reading content back yourself, always use the API or `/raw` endpoint.

## Notes

- Anonymous shares expire after 7 days by default (max 30 days).
- `editSecret` is only returned once at creation — store it securely if you need to update later.
- Both `viewUrl` and `editUrl` open the same editor. `editUrl` pre-authenticates edit access so the human can edit immediately.
- The `/raw` endpoint returns plain text — useful for piping into other tools.
- For persistent documents stored in a git repository, users can [sign up for a with.md account](https://with.md).
