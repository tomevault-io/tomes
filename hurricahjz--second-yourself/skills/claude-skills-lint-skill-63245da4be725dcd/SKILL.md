# lint — knowledge-graph health check

## Goal
Find the rot that accumulates as a knowledge base grows: **dead links, orphans, unindexed pages,
unresolved conflicts.**

## When to run (and when not)
**Don't lint routinely after a normal ingest** — ingest/query leave the graph integrity-clean by
construction (CLAUDE.md §6). Run lint for *drift* (manual edits/renames/deletes in Obsidian, external or
OneDrive/git sync changes) and periodic *discovery* (emerging gap pages, cross-corpus contradictions,
stale claims).

**Scope boundary:** confidence coverage, staleness scoring, and online-source freshness are **not**
lint's job — they live in the heavier, ~monthly **`deep-lint`**. Routine `/lint` stays cheap and never
reads pages for confidence or fetches anything.

## Triggers
`/lint` · `/health` · `/scan` · "check my wiki" · "find broken links / orphans / gaps".

## Pipeline (read-only until the user approves fixes)

### 1 — Index consistency (one scripted check)
Run `python3 .claude/skills/lint/check-index.py --vault .` (exit 0 = the probe ran, findings or none;
2 = broken premise). It compares `wiki/index.md` with the pages on disk and prints three lists with their
counts: **unindexed pages** (on disk, registered by no `- [[…]]` entry), **dangling index entries**
(registered, no page on disk) and **duplicate entries** (the same target registered twice). The rules are
deep-lint `audit-pools.py`'s, copied so a reader can check them against it: resolution on the basename with or without
`.md`, `index.md` and `log.md` excluded as pages, and a page's frontmatter `aliases:` counting as a
resolution on both sides (one deliberate departure from audit-pools, which aliases the dangling side only). It
prints `SCANNED: <pages> pages · <entries> index entries` as its own positive control (§11): a root it cannot
scan ends in `PROBE FAILED` and exit 2 before any list prints, so a clean result always carries non-zero counts.
Copy the three figures into the report — never re-derive them by hand. Shared stems are printed as information, not a finding.

### 2 — Link health (one shared script — the single source of truth for link rules)
Run `python3 .claude/skills/lint/check-links.py` (exit 0 = clean, 1 = findings; deep-lint's
structural pass uses the same script). It applies the codified rules so scans never re-derive them:
code spans / fenced blocks / HTML comments are not links; frontmatter `aliases` resolve; vault-path
and root-doc targets resolve; `wiki/log.md` is exempt as a source (append-only history); and **media
embeds `![[name.png|pdf|…]]` are checked against `assets/`** — a missing target is a **dead embed**,
reported separately (they are checked, not skipped). The script prints its scan totals as its own
positive control (§11): zero findings with zero links scanned is a broken probe, not a clean vault.
- The same script resolves each page's frontmatter `sources:` entries against disk and reports **dangling
  sources** separately from dead links: one line per page · path, with `SOURCES SCANNED:` as that arm's
  control. A URL, prose provenance (`email: …`, `session: …`) and an entry that declares its own deletion
  (`path (deleted YYYY-MM-DD)`) are counted, never flagged — provenance written as prose is legitimate. An entry the
  parser could not read prints as `(empty or unparsed sources)` inside the same block: read it, since it is the
  parser's own gap detector, not a dangler. A `~`- or `/`-led entry is provenance **outside the vault** (a run
  store, a home directory): resolved with `expanduser`, it prints under `OUT-OF-VAULT SOURCES: n present | m missing`
  — a missing one is a finding in that bucket, never a dangling vault path (register entry 2026-09-08: two false
  positives per run until then).
- Beside it, `python3 .claude/skills/lint/check_flag_admissions.py --vault .` (exit 0 = clean, 1 = findings, 2 =
  premise: not a vault root, or no `wiki/sources/`) lists every page under `wiki/sources/` whose prose or frontmatter
  comment **admits conversion damage** — the vocabulary `collapsed`, `lost inter-word spaces`, `inter-word`,
  `space-restored`, `run-together`, `run together`, `verbatim quotation is unavailable`, `lost every chart`, `lost
  every figure`, `lost every table`, `charts lost`, `figures lost` — while the page carries no **conversion** flag: a
  `flagged:` line counts only when its own text carries `conversion` (`source conversion suspect …`), so a flag about
  something else never masks an admission. A damage admission belongs in the flag channel (ingest Step 0 scores every
  file carrying `converted_by:` and records a `suspect` one in scope `pdf` as `flagged:`), which is the only channel deep-lint reads;
  the fix for a hit is a `flagged:` line on the page, never a rewrite of the prose — and the flag's end is ingest 3c's
  terminal state: a repaired conversion scored `clean` in `sources:` plus the dated Provenance sentence, which the
  probe counts under its `RESOLVED:` line (an admission that also names a `repaired conversion`), never as a finding.
  It prints its own in-memory controls (a page that must fire; its conversion-flagged twin that must not; a twin
  flagged for something else that must; a resolved twin) and the count scanned; an ordinary use of `collapsed` in
  prose is a false positive to read and dismiss in the report, not to silence in the script (register entry
  2026-09-08, ingest Step 0 conversions, and the folds of the same day).
- Every script in this directory refuses, in vault mode, a root that is not a vault (no `raw/` + `wiki/`): one `PROBE
  FAILED: <root> is not a vault root (no raw/ or wiki/)` line on stderr and exit 2, so a wrong root can
  never read as a clean vault scan (the 2026-08-26 standard; the register entry of 2026-09-06 that closed it
  here; the file-mode forms `anomaly-lister --pages` and `tier-cap-check --verdicts` keep their own checks). Every
  Python script and `check-qmd-registry.sh` take `--vault ROOT`; an unknown flag is refused with exit 2, never
  read as the root.
- Orphans are scripted too: `python3 .claude/skills/lint/check-orphans.py --vault .` reports a page with **no inbound links** from any other page as an **orphan**, exempting `index`, `log`, and `maps/` pages (Maps of Content are navigational entry points, not orphans). It applies this directory's link rules, prints its own inbound-link control (zero orphans with a zero control is a broken probe, §11), and additionally lists the pages `index.md` alone reaches — information, not a finding.
- Two further helpers in this directory serve deep-lint and the routing design's verify leg, not routine lint: `tier-cap-check.py` (§4.6 type caps and boundaries; a documented override on the `confidence:` line is reported separately, never as a violation) and `anomaly-lister.py` (page-visible anomalies: open conflict blocks, `flagged:` lines, thin-page notes, `unverified` markers). Suite for all three: `bash .claude/skills/lint/test_lint_phase2.sh`.
- **Routing (M0, 2026-09-02; residue closed 2026-09-07):** every lint check is a script; the agent reads reports and never re-derives a scripted count (orphans became `check-orphans.py`, Phase 2 of the routing design; Step 1's index-consistency comparison became `check-index.py`, the last hand comparison in this pipeline).

### 2b — Pending freshness flags (count only — reconciling them is deep-lint's job)
`grep -rl "^flagged:" wiki --include='*.md' | wc -l` — with the engine control
`grep -rl "^confidence:" wiki --include='*.md' | wc -l` (must be >0, proving the probe ran).
Report the count; at **≥5 flagged pages**, suggest running `/deep-lint` (the adaptive-cadence
signal from `wiki/developments/deeplint-scalable-maintenance-design.md`). Never read or resolve
the flagged pages here — lint counts, deep-lint reconciles.

### 2c — Attic-leak check (filenames only — attic contents are never opened)
Live pages must never link into the attic (CLAUDE.md §2.1): Obsidian resolves wikilinks vault-wide,
so a surviving `[[link]]` to an archived note silently reconnects retired material and can pull a
query in. List basenames only — `find attic -type f -name '*.md'`, skip `MANIFEST.md` (the check
reads names, never contents; attic absent or empty → report "attic-leak: n/a"). For each basename
`b`, grep live wiki (excluding `wiki/log.md`, append-only history) for the exact link forms
`"[[b]]" "[[b|" "[[b#" "/b]]" "/b|"` — plain-text mentions ("b (archived)") are the §2.1 sweep
style and are NOT findings. Any hit is a **leak finding**: report it; the fix (owner-confirmed) is
re-sweeping to plain text per §2.1, or `/attic restore` if the page should live again. Control
(§11): the same pipeline against one known live page name must return >0 before reporting "no leaks".

### 2d — qmd registry guard (one scripted check; skipped silently when qmd is dormant)
`wiki/log.md` must stay out of the semantic index (CLAUDE.md §10) — embeddings key on a file's
whole-content hash, so every append re-embeds the whole timeline, and a hit invites an ~80k-token
`qmd get`. The exclusion lives in `~/.config/qmd/index.yml`, **outside the vault and outside both
git repos**, so it can disappear silently. Run
`sh .claude/skills/lint/check-qmd-registry.sh .` and copy its one line into the report verbatim.
The script carries its own §11 control (`index.md`, deliberately kept, must be listed) and reports
`PROBE FAILED` rather than "clean" when its own premise breaks. Exit 1 = finding; the fix is to
restore `ignore: ["**/log.md"]` on the `wiki` collection and re-run `qmd update`.

### 2e — Injection guard (names only — no skill or definition contents are read)
Third-party installers write into the roots the harness auto-loads, and anything landing there reaches
**every** session (Agent Reach's documented SKILL.md auto-install; two register incidents prove the
class: `wiki/developments/known-issues.md` 2026-08-21/22). **Two roots, four arms.** Skills are
**directories** under `.claude/skills/`; agent definitions are **files** under `.claude/agents/`, and
each is auto-loaded — a definition names a lane's model, tools and write scope, so an unsanctioned one
is the same exposure as an unsanctioned skill. The asymmetry is real: `ls` yields names in one case and
filenames in the other, so the `comm` inputs differ. Both diff against the same baseline,
`.claude/skills/lint/sanctioned-skills.txt` (its `-skills` filename is kept for compatibility; it is the
registry for both).
```bash
b=".claude/skills/lint/sanctioned-skills.txt"    # ships: vault skill names + agent definition filenames
hs="$HOME/.claude/skills/.sanctioned.txt"        # machine-local baselines, never shipped
ha="$HOME/.claude/agents/.sanctioned.txt"
[ -s "$b" ] || echo "PROBE FAILED: vault baseline missing/empty"            # premise guard, never "clean"
# vault skills (directories)
comm -13 <(grep '^vault:' "$b" | cut -d: -f2 | sort) <(ls .claude/skills | sort)
# vault agent definitions (FILES — list everything, do not filter to *.md: a stray file here is the finding)
[ -d .claude/agents ] && comm -13 <(grep '^agent:' "$b" | cut -d: -f2 | sort) <(ls .claude/agents | sort) \
                      || echo "agents-guard: n/a (no .claude/agents in this vault)"
# user-level roots
[ -d ~/.claude/skills ] || echo "PROBE FAILED: ~/.claude/skills missing"    # premise guard, never "clean"
[ -s "$hs" ] && [ -d ~/.claude/skills ] && comm -13 <(sort "$hs") <(ls ~/.claude/skills | sort)
[ -s "$ha" ] && [ -d ~/.claude/agents ] && comm -13 <(sort "$ha") <(ls ~/.claude/agents | sort)
```
Any name printed = an **unsanctioned entry** (finding: report it; the fix — owner-confirmed — is removal,
or a conscious baseline addition in the same pass that sanctions it). **Premise failures never read as
clean, each in its own way:** a missing/empty vault baseline reports `PROBE FAILED`; an absent
`.claude/agents/` reports `n/a` (a vault may legitimately have none, so absence is not a finding and not
a pass either); an absent user-level root reports `PROBE FAILED`; no machine-local baseline yet (fresh
machine) → report that root's current listing as info and propose seeding it after the owner reviews,
never a finding, never auto-seeded. Baseline entries missing on disk are info (drift), not findings.
§11 control before trusting any empty result: re-run **each** arm's `comm` with a known-absent name
injected into the disk side (`printf 'zzz-ctrl\n'`) and confirm it prints — one arm's control does not
vouch for another's.
(Deep-lint inherits this via its structural pass.)
- **Throttle check (delegate skill §2, 2026-09-02):** `python3 .claude/skills/delegate/throttle.py check` — each `DRIFT` / `MISSING` / `UNROUTED` / `DESCRIPTION-TIER` line is a finding (the fix is `throttle.py set <active>` for drift, a definition or routing entry for the other two, the range wording for a description); `PROBE FAILED` (unreadable `routing.json`, unknown throttle name, absent `.claude/agents/`) never reads as clean. The script prints its own §11 control (a planted-drift comparator) on every run.

**Register arm (2026-09-05; names only, both directions).** `wiki/developments/capability-register.md` lists every
user-level skill as one row (`| \`name\` |`) under `## User-level skills`; the directory and the register must agree:
```bash
reg="wiki/developments/capability-register.md"
[ -s "$reg" ] || echo "register-arm: n/a (no register page yet — a fresh vault; /adopt seeds it)"
[ -s "$reg" ] && rows=$(awk '/^## User-level skills/{f=1} /^## Plugins/{f=0} f' "$reg" | grep -oE '^\| `[a-z0-9-]+`' | tr -d '|` ' | sort -u) \
  && { echo "installed, no row:"; comm -13 <(printf '%s\n' "$rows") <(ls ~/.claude/skills | sort); echo "row, not installed:"; comm -23 <(printf '%s\n' "$rows") <(ls ~/.claude/skills | sort); }
```
Either list non-empty = a finding (the fix, owner-confirmed, is a row or an install, never a silent delete). Control before
trusting two empty lists: re-run with one real row name filtered out of `rows` and see it appear under "installed, no row".


### 2f — Customisation pairing (cheap greps — no preference content is judged)
The preference layer is two files: always-on `CUSTOMISATION.md` (core: contracts + default style/role
blocks + `customised`) and on-demand `CUSTOMISATION-definitions.md` (the other definitions; read on
switch). Core absent (fresh vault) → report `customisation-pairing: n/a` and skip. Checks:
- The `style` and `role` values in core's `## Settings` each have a matching `^### <value>` heading
  **in core** (the block-move rule keeps the defaults there). §11 control: the same probe must find
  `### customised` in core (it never moves) before any missing-heading finding — or an all-present
  result — is trusted.
- No `### ` heading appears in both files:
  `comm -12 <(grep '^### ' CUSTOMISATION.md | sort) <(grep '^### ' CUSTOMISATION-definitions.md | sort)`
  must print nothing. A hit = a duplicated definition (finding: propose removing one copy; the owner
  says which — never auto-edit their preferences). Note `### ` lines inside HTML comments (e.g. the
  generalist example) can surface here; a hit inside a comment is reported as info, not a finding.
- Definitions file missing while core exists → **warning** (switches beyond the defaults will run
  without their definitions): propose recreating it from the private backup or the template seed
  (the `mk_custom_defs` function in the shipped `setup.sh`). Never fatal, never auto-created.

### 2g — Shipped-surface wikilinks (one scripted check — the publish gate's test suite calls the same script)
Every `.md` under `.claude/skills/` and `.claude/agents/` ships with the public framework; a `[[wikilink]]`
in one of them that resolves in this vault but not in the published copy is dead for every installer — the
class the 2026-08-30 delegate-skill finding proved. Run `python3 .claude/skills/lint/check-shipped-links.py .`
and copy its first line into the report verbatim. Scope is keyed on the export's auto-discovery contract
(`list_skills`/`list_agents`), minus vault-shaped content bundled inside a skill (any `wiki/` or `raw/`
segment, i.e. the shipped seed demo); names that ship are never findings (`index`, `log`, and the seed's own
pages); links inside code spans, fenced blocks and HTML comments are not links; targets resolve as Obsidian
does, frontmatter aliases included; root docs are out of scope (their `[[…]]` are naming examples by design —
CLAUDE.md §12's ship-safe-citation rule governs citations there). A link dead in both copies is counted on
the control line, never flagged: shipped skills use placeholders such as `[[topic]]`. The script carries its
own §11 control (a synthetic surface linking a synthetic page must be caught) and tells legitimate absence
from a broken premise: an empty `wiki/` (a fresh install, the published copy itself) reports `n/a`; a missing
`wiki/`, no surfaces, an unreadable surface or a silent self-control reports `PROBE FAILED`, never "clean".
Exit 1 = findings: the fix (owner-confirmed) is rewriting the citation in ship-safe wording — the page name
in code font, no link — never deleting the reference. The publish gate's test suite runs the same script
(its leg 14), so an edit-time miss here is caught there; regression fixtures live beside the script
(`bash .claude/skills/lint/test_check_shipped_links.sh`). Design record:
`wiki/developments/shipped-surface-wikilink-guard.md`.

### 3 — Conflict audit
Find pages containing `## Conflicts / Open Questions`. List each unresolved conflict (the two sides)
as cognitive tech-debt to resolve.

### 4 — Gap scan (optional, suggestive)
Note entities/concepts mentioned often but lacking their own page, and stale claims newer sources
supersede. Suggest sources or web searches to fill gaps.

## Graph colour restore (on-demand — NOT part of a routine lint)
The graph's per-type colours live in `.obsidian/graph.json` → `colorGroups`. That file is **volatile**:
Obsidian rewrites it from memory whenever a graph setting changes (or a sync clobbers it), and can wipe
the palette so the graph turns all-grey. A wiped palette is **immediately visible**, so handle it
**only on a real signal** — never scan for it on a routine lint.

**Trigger — do this only when:**
1. the user reports a grey/colourless graph or asks to check/fix/restore graph colours, **or**
2. it is a **fresh vault** at first-run — `ingest`'s bootstrap calls this once (see that skill).

Otherwise do nothing: a routine `/lint` never reads `graph.json` or the palette.

**Procedure (one shared script — the single source of truth for the palette):**
- **Detect:** `python3 .claude/skills/lint/apply-palette.py --check` → exit 0 = palette complete (stop);
  exit 1 = it prints the missing framework groups.
- **Confirm, then restore:** on the user's OK, `python3 .claude/skills/lint/apply-palette.py --apply` —
  it **merges** the canonical palette (`.claude/skills/lint/palette.json`) into `colorGroups`, adding
  only the missing framework groups and **preserving any custom groups**. Idempotent.
- **Reload:** tell the user to **close the graph view and reload Obsidian** (`Cmd/Ctrl+R`), so Obsidian
  does not overwrite the edit with stale in-memory state.

The palette data (`palette.json`) and logic (`apply-palette.py`) ship with this skill, so `setup.sh`,
`ingest`'s first-run, and this restore all use the **same** definition — read **only** on this path,
never on a routine lint.

## Report format
```markdown
## 🩺 Wiki Health Report — YYYY-MM-DD

### ✅ Healthy
- ...

### ⚠️ Warnings
- **N orphan pages**: [[..]] — suggest linking or categorizing
- **N unindexed pages**: [[..]] — on disk but missing from index.md

### ❌ Errors
- **N dead links**: [[Source]] → [[Missing Target]] · **N dead embeds**: [[Source]] → ![[missing.png]]
- **N unresolved conflicts**: [[Page]]

### ⏳ Flags
- **N pages carry `flagged:`** (engine control OK) — ≥5 → consider `/deep-lint`
- `<the qmd-registry line, verbatim from the script>` · `attic-leak: none / n/a / N leaks` · `skill-guard: clean / N unsanctioned (control OK)` · `customisation-pairing: ok / n/a / N findings` · `throttle-check: clean (N of M diffed, control OK) / N findings / PROBE FAILED` · `shipped-links: clean / n/a / N dead / PROBE FAILED`

### 🛠️ Proposed next steps
1. Auto-register unindexed pages? (y/n)
2. Re-derive / resolve the listed conflicts?
```

## Hard constraints
- **Read-only scan.** Do not modify, rename, or delete anything before the report.
- **No unverified "clean".** A check that returns zero findings must be validated with a positive
  control (the same probe matching something known to exist) before the report may say "clean"
  (CLAUDE.md §11).
- **Wait for confirmation** before applying any fix.
- **Graph colour restore is on-demand only** (see its section) — never scanned or read on a routine lint.
- After approved fixes, append to `wiki/log.md`:
  `## [YYYY-MM-DD] lint | fixed N issues (M dead links, K unindexed)`.
- **Refresh on write:** if approved fixes touched wiki pages, the `qmd-search` refresh applies — run it
  inline only where no turn-end refresh hook is installed (that skill owns the rule); a no-op when qmd is dormant.
- Report in **British/UK English**.
