# Packet Tracer MCP — operating guide

A Model Context Protocol server (`packet-tracer`) that drives **Cisco Packet Tracer**: plan a
topology, validate it, generate IOS/PTBuilder artifacts, and **live-deploy** into a *running* PT
over an HTTP bridge. The `pt_*` tools are your only interface — plus raw JS via `pt_send_raw`.

## ⛔ Prime directive: DISCOVER, never invent

The single biggest failure mode for a model driving this MCP is **guessing** — a model name, a
port name, a slot id, a cable type, a module name, or a Script-Engine API method. Every one of
these is **discoverable**, and a wrong guess either fails validation or (for raw JS) **freezes
Packet Tracer** (see the modal-freeze rule below).

Rules:
1. If you did not read it from a tool result, an MCP resource, or this skill, **you do not know
   it** — look it up first.
2. Before planning/deploying: `pt_list_devices`, `pt_list_templates`, `pt_get_device_details`,
   and `pt_list_modules` (if installing modules).
3. Before any raw JS: use only methods in the **Verified Script-Engine API** table below. If you
   need something not listed, probe it **inside a try/catch** before relying on it.
4. After every mutation, read back with `pt_query_topology` / `pt_export_topology` and confirm.
5. When something isn't in the catalog, say so — do not fabricate a device/module to fill the gap.

## The bridge (mental model)

```
LLM ──▶ MCP server ──▶ HTTP bridge :54321 ──▶ MCP Control Center (PT extension) ──▶ PT Script Engine
```

- The MCP queues JS at `:54321`; the PT extension polls `/next` every 500 ms and runs each command
  via `$se('runCode', …)` in PT's **Script Engine**, posting results back to `/result`.
- **`XMLHttpRequest` does NOT exist in the Script Engine** (only in the extension webview). That's
  why all I/O goes through the bridge.
- Confirm the link first with **`pt_bridge_status`** → must say *"ACTIVE and CONNECTED"*. If "NOT
  connected", the user opens **Extensions → MCP BUILDER** in PT (or dismisses a stuck error modal).

## Mandatory workflow

- New topology, one-shot: **`pt_full_build`**.
- New topology, stepwise: `pt_list_devices` → `pt_plan_topology` → `pt_validate_plan` → `pt_live_deploy`.
- Edit a live topology: `pt_bridge_status` → `pt_query_topology` → `pt_add_*`/`pt_rename_device`/….
- Add modules: `pt_query_topology` → `pt_list_modules(router_model=…)` → `pt_install_modules_batch`.

## Tool catalog (61)

**Discovery / read-only:** `pt_list_devices`, `pt_get_device_details(model|alias)`, `pt_list_templates`,
`pt_list_modules(router_model, category)`, `pt_list_projects`, `pt_load_project`, `pt_bridge_status`,
`pt_query_topology`*, `pt_export_topology`* (*need bridge).
**Pure planning/generation:** `pt_plan_topology`, `pt_estimate_plan`, `pt_validate_plan`, `pt_fix_plan`,
`pt_explain_plan`, `pt_generate_script(include_configs)`, `pt_generate_configs`, `pt_full_build(deploy=…)`.
`pt_plan_topology`/`pt_full_build` accept `vlans`, `dual_stack`, `ipv6_base`, `wireless_laptops`.
**Disk / clipboard:** `pt_export`, `pt_deploy`.
**PT project files:** `pt_save_project(filename)` / `pt_open_project(path)` — these write and read the
real `.pkt`, which is NOT what `pt_export` does (that one dumps the plan and scripts to disk).
`pt_open_project` replaces the current topology.
**Live deploy & edit:** `pt_live_deploy` (auto-reconciles dropped devices), `pt_add_device`, `pt_add_link`,
`pt_delete_link`, `pt_delete_device`, `pt_rename_device`, `pt_move_device`, `pt_set_port`, `pt_send_raw`,
`pt_add_module`, `pt_install_modules_batch`.
**ACL / NAT (live):** `pt_apply_acl`, `pt_apply_acl_object`, `pt_remove_acl`, `pt_remove_acl_object`,
`pt_apply_nat`, `pt_remove_nat` — all accept `dry_run=True` to preview CLI without touching PT.
**Config-driven (live, dry_run):** `pt_apply_vlan` (VLAN/trunk/inter-VLAN subinterfaces),
`pt_apply_stp`, `pt_apply_port_security`, `pt_apply_hardening` (hostname/banner/enable-secret/users/SSH),
`pt_apply_interface_tuning` (serial clock-rate + OSPF/EIGRP per-interface knobs).
**Verification (live):** `pt_diff` (plan vs live), `pt_health_check` (down links, dup IPs, cabled-no-IP).
`pt_verify_connectivity` gives **three** verdicts, not two: `CONECTIVIDAD OK` (every packet returned),
`CONECTIVIDAD PARCIAL` (some loss — normal on a first ping because of ARP, so re-run once before
calling it a fault) and `SIN CONECTIVIDAD`. It works from routers and switches, not only hosts.
`pt_health_check` no longer lists layer-2 ports as "cabled without IP", so anything it does report
there is a real host that never got its DHCP lease.
**Live-state inspection (read the device, not the plan):** `pt_audit_security(device="")` (security
posture with severities; never returns passwords or hashes, only the algorithm label),
`pt_inspect_ports(device, only_linked)` (per-port line/protocol, MAC, duplex, bandwidth, MTU, CDP,
NAT mode, applied ACLs; flags cabled-but-down), `pt_read_vlans(switch)` (real VLAN database, separates
your VLANs from PT's factory ones), `pt_device_power(device, on)` (power-cycle with read-back).
**Canvas (capture & annotate):** `pt_screenshot(filename, fmt, output_dir)` writes the image to disk
and returns the **path** — never the bytes, they would flood the context. `pt_add_note(x, y, text)`
writes a label; font size is not settable. `pt_clear_annotations(kind)` removes annotations only,
never devices or links (drawings included — redraw circles after clearing notes).
There is no drawing *tool*, but PT's `drawCircle` **does** work from raw JS once you pass all
seven arguments — see "Drawing IS possible" below. Colours still don't take.
Canvas coordinates match `pt_add_device`: routers ~y=100, switches ~y=250, hosts ~y=400.
Recipe for a diagram worth showing: `pt_full_build` → `pt_add_note` per subnet and link →
`drawCircle` per LAN → `pt_screenshot` → adjust and repeat.
**Backup / workspace:** `pt_backup_config(device, include_xml)` (real startup-config + serial,
config-register, boot images), `pt_project_metadata(description="")` (saved filename, PT version,
description, device/link count; pass `description` to set it), `pt_workspace_options(...)` — tri-state
flags, `-1` leaves a setting alone. Turn `auto_cabling=0` before a scripted build if you need links on
exact interfaces, and check `external_network_access` before assuming traffic stays in the simulator.
**Telemetry / QoS:** `pt_apply_netflow(device, name, destination_ip, udp_port, version, source_port,
monitors, remove, dry_run)` configures a NetFlow exporter directly (not via CLI) and reads it back to
confirm. `pt_read_qos(device)` is **read-only**: QoS cannot be created programmatically, so author
class-maps and policy-maps with IOS CLI and use this to verify.
**Simulation:** `pt_simulation_mode(on)` (Realtime ↔ Simulation), `pt_simulation_step(action, times)`
(`forward`/`back`/`reset`), `pt_read_packet_trace(limit, device, include_decisions)` — the event list
plus PT's own per-OSI-layer explanation of each decision (same text as the GUI's PDU Details pane).
Workflow: `pt_simulation_mode(on=True)` → generate traffic (`pt_verify_connectivity`) → `pt_read_packet_trace`.
There is **no `pt_send_pdu`**: PT does not let an extension originate a packet the way the GUI's
*Add Simple PDU* button does. Generate traffic with a real ping instead.
**Resources:** `pt://catalog/devices`, `/cables`, `/aliases`, `/templates`, `pt://capabilities`.

## Advanced builds (verified live 2026-06-27)
- **Inter-VLAN / router-on-a-stick:** `pt_full_build(template="router_on_a_stick", vlans=3)` → N VLANs,
  trunk uplink, router `.1q` subinterfaces, one `/24` + DHCP pool per VLAN. 2960 omits trunk
  `encapsulation` (dot1q-only); 3560 emits it.
- **IPv6 dual-stack:** `pt_plan_topology(dual_stack=True)` → routers get `ipv6 address` via CLI +
  `ipv6 unicast-routing`; hosts use **SLAAC** (`configurePcIpv6` = enable + auto-config). Static host
  IPv6 is NOT settable via the PT API (`addIpv6Address` fails on HostPort) — SLAAC is the path.
- **WiFi laptops:** `wireless_laptops=True` swaps each Laptop-PT NIC to `PT-LAPTOP-NM-1W` (slot `"0"`)
  → `Wireless0`, and adds **one `AccessPoint-PT` per LAN**, each wired to that LAN's own switch.
  ⚠️ **Wireless addressing is NOT deterministic.** Laptops auto-associate on the default SSID and
  PT exposes **no SSID API** (verified: neither the AP nor its port has `setSsid`), so with more
  than one AP a laptop can associate to *any* of them and take a DHCP lease from **another LAN's
  pool**. Measured on PT 9.0.1: LT10, sitting right next to its own LAN's AP, still associated to
  the LAN-1 AP and got `192.168.0.13`; only with that AP powered off did it take `192.168.4.25`.
  The planner now emits a `WIRELESS_AMBIGUOUS_ASSOCIATION` **warning** when ≥2 APs coexist.
  Always confirm with `pt_inspect_ports`; for deterministic addressing use `wireless_laptops=False`.

## ⚠️ Verified PT Script-Engine API (for `pt_send_raw` / raw JS)

These are the **real** signatures (verified against the MCP's runtime patches and live testing).
If a method is not here, do **not** assume it exists.

**Globals**
- `getDevices(filter)` → **Array of NAME STRINGS**, not device objects (filter `""` = all,
  `"router"` = routers). Calling `.getName()` / `.getPorts()` on an element throws
  `TypeError: Property 'getName' of object R1 is not a function` — the element *is* `"R1"`.
  To get the object, feed each name to `ipc.network().getDevice(name)`.
- `allModuleTypes[name]` → module-type handle (passed to `addModule`)
- `reportResult(data)` → exists **only when `wait_result=True`**; POSTs the result back
- ❌ there is **no global `getDevice(...)`**; ❌ no `XMLHttpRequest` in the Script Engine

**Network / device** — `var d = ipc.network().getDevice("R1");`  // ← correct singular lookup, may be null
- `ipc.appWindow().getActiveWorkspace().getLogicalWorkspace()` → `lw`
  - `lw.addDevice(type, model, x, y)` → autoName · `lw.createLink(d1,p1,d2,p2,cableEnumInt)`
- `d.getPorts()` → **Array of port-name strings** — use `.length`, `[i]`, `.join(",")`.
  ❌ never `.size()`, `.at(i)`, `.getName()` on it (TypeError → modal → freeze).
- `d.getPort(name)` → Port | null · `d.getPower()/setPower(bool)/skipBoot()/setName(name)`
- `d.moveToLocation(x, y)` → reposiciona en el canvas lógico. Es lo que usa `pt_move_device`;
  en un solo `pt_send_raw` podés reacomodar decenas de dispositivos sin una llamada por cada uno.
- `d.addModule(slot, allModuleTypes[model], modelName)` → bool  (**slot is a STRING**)
- `d.getProcess("AclProcess")` → AclProcess | null (routers) · `d.enterCommand(cmd, mode)`
- `d.getCommandLine()` → console handle with `getOutput()`, `enterCommand(cmd)`, `getPrompt()`.
  Use **this** for console work: `getCommandPrompt()` exists ONLY on hosts and throws
  `TypeError` on any router. PCs expose both, so `getCommandLine()` covers both worlds.
  ⚠️ A router deployed by the MCP was never touched by console, so it sits at
  `Would you like to enter the initial configuration dialog? [yes/no]:` — a `ping` sent
  there is eaten as the yes/no answer. Prime it first: answer `no`, then send an empty
  command to clear `Press RETURN to get started.`
- `d.setDhcpFlag(bool)`, `d.setDefaultGateway(ip)`

**Port** — `var p = d.getPort("GigabitEthernet0/0");`
- `p.getLink()` → link | null (null = free) · `p.setIpSubnetMask(ip, mask)` · `p.setDefaultGateway(ip)`
- `p.setDnsServerIp(ip)` · `p.setAclInID(id)`/`p.setAclOutID(id)` (pass `""` to clear)

**AclProcess** — `var ap = d.getProcess("AclProcess");`
- `ap.addAcl(name)` · `ap.getAcl(name)` → acl|null · `ap.removeAcl(name)`
- `acl.addStatement(str)` → bool · `acl.getCommandCount()` → int

**Cable enum ints (for `lw.createLink`)**: straight 8100 · cross 8101 · roll 8102 · fiber 8103 ·
phone 8104 · cable 8105 · serial 8106 · auto 8107 · console 8108 · wireless 8109 · coaxial 8110 ·
octal 8111 · cellular 8112 · usb 8113 · custom_io 8114.

### 🔒 ALWAYS wrap raw JS in try/catch
```js
try { var d = ipc.network().getDevice("R1"); reportResult("ports="+d.getPorts().join(",")); }
catch (e) { reportResult("ERR: " + e); }
```
An **uncaught** error pops a modal `QMessageBox` in PT ("An error occurred… ReferenceError…") that is
**modal** and freezes the webview polling loop — the bridge goes "NOT connected" until a human clicks
**OK**. A **caught** error never does. (The server also guards commands now, but wrap anyway — it's
free insurance and keeps results clean.)

## Validation: read `plan.errors` before you deploy

`pt_plan_topology` / `pt_full_build` return `errors[]` and `warnings[]`;
`pt_validate_plan` returns the same as typed codes. **An empty `errors[]` is now
meaningful** — it did not used to be. The validator only checked per-device facts,
so a topology split into islands passed with `valid: true`, deployed, and failed
silently. It now walks the graph.

| Code | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `TOPOLOGY_DISCONNECTED` | The cabled devices form more than one component — something has no path to the rest | Usually the hub ran out of ports (a 2911 has 3 Gigabit). Use a bigger model, add a module, or fewer routers. **Do not deploy**: the isolated part cannot route |
| `OSPF_NO_NETWORKS` | An OSPF process with zero `network` statements | That router has no addressed, linked interface. Fix the links first |
| `OSPF_INVALID_ROUTER_ID` | `router-id 0.0.0.0`, which IOS rejects | Same root cause as above |
| `WIRELESS_AMBIGUOUS_ASSOCIATION` | **warning** — two or more APs share the default SSID | Not a blocker. Confirm with `pt_inspect_ports` which subnet each wireless host actually landed in |
| `IP_CONFLICT` / `INVALID_IP_ADDRESS` | Duplicate or malformed address | Re-address |
| `DHCP_GATEWAY_MISMATCH` | **warning** — the pool gateway is on no interface of that router | Check the pool against the router's interfaces |

Wireless hosts are excluded from the connectivity graph on purpose: they carry no
cable by design, so counting them as islands would flag every wireless topology
as broken.

## Big topologies: when the plan does not fit through a tool parameter

`pt_live_deploy` takes the plan as a **string argument**, so a plan with ~90
devices (thousands of lines of JSON) cannot practically be passed to it, and
`pt_load_project` only hands the JSON back to you.

For anything past roughly 60 devices, or for shapes the templates do not cover
(mixed IGPs per region, custom cores), build it **locally** and push it straight
to the mailbox — the plan never has to travel through a tool call:

```python
from src.packet_tracer_mcp.domain.models.plans import TopologyPlan, DevicePlan, LinkPlan
from src.packet_tracer_mcp.domain.services.validator import validate_plan
from src.packet_tracer_mcp.infrastructure.generator.ptbuilder_generator import (
    generate_executable_script,
)
from src.packet_tracer_mcp.infrastructure.execution.file_bridge import FileBridge

plan = TopologyPlan(...)                 # devices, links, ospf/eigrp/rip_configs, vlans
result = validate_plan(plan)             # same rules the MCP uses — check it first
script = generate_executable_script(plan)

bridge = FileBridge()
assert bridge.pt_alive()                 # Script Engine heartbeat
for batch in chunks(script.split("
"), 25):
    body = "".join(f"try{{{line}}}catch(e){{}}" for line in batch)
    bridge.send_and_wait(body + "reportResult('ok');", timeout=90.0)
```

Verified: 88 devices, 88 links, 282 JS statements in 12 batches over the file
bridge. One `try/catch` per statement so a single failure does not take the batch
down. A plan can carry `ospf_configs`, `eigrp_configs` and `rip_configs` at the
same time — and one router can appear in two of them, which is how you build a
redistribution boundary. **`redistribute` itself is not in the plan model**: push
it as extra CLI with `configureIosDevice(name, cli)`.

## Common mistakes → corrections (do not repeat these)

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Right | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `getDevice("R1")` | `ipc.network().getDevice("R1")` (or `getDevices("")` to list) | no global `getDevice` → ReferenceError → freeze |
| `d.getPorts().size()` / `.at(i)` / `.getName()` | `d.getPorts()[i]` (string array) | getPorts returns strings |
| `pt_add_module(slot=0)` | `slot="0"` (string) | int slot silently fails (`===` compare) |
| cable `"crossover"` | `"cross"` | alias works but `cross` is canonical |
| invent model `"Cisco4500"` | `pt_list_devices` / `pt_get_device_details` first | use real catalog names |
| invent module `"NM-4T"` | `pt_list_modules(router_model=…)` first | use real module names |
| raw JS unwrapped | wrap in `try/catch` + `reportResult` | uncaught error freezes the bridge |
| trust `add_module` "timeout" = failure | verify with `pt_query_topology` | it often succeeds despite timeout |

## Cables, ports, IP conventions

- **Cables (15)**: `straight, cross, roll, serial, fiber, console, phone, cable, coaxial, auto, wireless,
  octal, cellular, usb, custom_io`. Omit `cable_type` in `pt_add_link` to infer (router↔router &
  switch↔switch → `cross`; router↔switch, switch↔host → `straight`).
- **Exact ports**: 2911 `GigabitEthernet0/0..0/2` but 1941/2901 only `0/0..0/1`;
  ISR4321/4331 `GigabitEthernet0/0/0..`;
  2960/3560 `FastEthernet0/1..0/24` + `GigabitEthernet0/1..0/2`; PC/Laptop/Server `FastEthernet0`;
  HWIC-2T in `"0/x"` → `Serial0/x/0`,`Serial0/x/1`;
  **Cloud-PT has 8 ports**: `Serial0..3`, `Modem4`, `Modem5`, `Ethernet6`, `Coaxial7`.
  ⚠️ A cloud only *forwards* over its serial ports once frame relay is configured, and the MCP has no
  tool for that. For a WAN core that actually passes traffic, link routers to each other with `/30`s and
  hang the cloud off `Ethernet6` as an external stub.
- **IP plan** (`pt_plan_topology`): LANs `/24` from `192.168.0.0`, gateway `.1`, hosts from `.2`;
  router↔router `/30` from `10.0.0.0`; DHCP pool per LAN with `.1` excluded; routing
  `static|ospf|eigrp|rip|none` (+ `floating_routes`, `ospf_process_id`, `eigrp_as`).

## Module install by router family

`slot` is a **STRING**. Pick a module whose `compatible_with` includes the model — the MCP **rejects an
incompatible module up front** when the module declares `compatible_with` (HWIC/NIM/built-ins); generic
`PT-*` modules have no declared constraint, so choose sensibly there. Always confirm with
`pt_query_topology` after install; a single `pt_add_module` may report a **timeout yet still succeed**.

| Router family | Module type | Slot (string) | Ports added | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ISR G2 — 2911/2901 | HWIC (`HWIC-2T`, `HWIC-1GE-SFP`) | `"0/0".."0/3"` | `Serial0/x/0`,`Serial0/x/1` | ✅ verified 2911 |
| ISR G2 — **1941** | HWIC | **only `"0/0"`, `"0/1"`** — it has 2 slots, not 4 | `Serial0/x/0`,`Serial0/x/1` | ✅ verified 1941 (PT 9.0.1) |
| ISR 4000 — ISR4321/4331 | NIM (`NIM-2T`, `NIM-ES2-4`) | **`"0/1"`, `"0/2"`** | `Serial0/1/0`,`Serial0/1/1` | ✅ verified ISR4321 & ISR4331 |
| 2811 / 2620XM / 2621XM | NM (`NM-4A/S`, `NM-2FE2W`,…) | **`"1"`** | `Serial1/0..1/3` | ✅ verified 2811 |
| Router-PT (generic) | NM (`NM-*`, `PT-ROUTER-NM-*`) | `"1"` | ⚠️ non-standard ids (e.g. `Serial2/0`) | installs, odd port names |

> ⚠️ The `pt_add_module` docstring/SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS say NIM slots are `"0"`/`"1"` — **that is
> wrong**; the working slot is **`"0/1"`** (chassis/subslot). HWIC = `"0/x"`, NM = `"1"`, NIM = `"0/1"`.
> The install *mechanism* (`addModule`) is identical across routers — only the **slot string** differs
> by family. Always confirm the result with `pt_query_topology`.

Prefer `pt_install_modules_batch` for multiple modules (one power-cycle); individual installs
power-cycle the device and can exceed the wait window (and often report a timeout despite succeeding).

## Known rough edges (verified by benchmark against PT 9.0.1)

- **Module compatibility is enforced for modules that declare `compatible_with`** (HWIC/NIM/built-ins
  reject a wrong model); generic `PT-*` modules carry no constraint, so still pick sensibly.
- **`pt_add_module` (single) can report a timeout but still succeed** — verify ports, don't blindly retry.
  (`pt_install_modules_batch` no longer guesses: it reports `installed` per module, see round 2 below.)
- **`three_router_triangle` closes the ring (R3↔R1)** and `hub_spoke` wires R1→every spoke — the
  orchestrator honors the template shape (was a flat chain before). ⚠️ **`hub_spoke` is limited by the
  hub's port count**: a 2911 has 3 Gigabit ports, so it cannot serve 5 spokes plus its own LAN. Asking
  for more no longer fails silently — the plan comes back with `TOPOLOGY_DISCONNECTED`. Pick a router
  with more ports, add a module, or use `multi_lan` (a chain needs only 3 ports per router).
- **`pt://capabilities` is derived from the live tool registry** (`supported_live.nat/acl/modules/…`) — it
  can no longer drift; trust it *and* the tools.
- **`pt_live_deploy` "N/N verified" checks device/link existence only** — host IPs may lag a few seconds.
- **Invalid `routing=` raises a raw exception**; invalid `router_model` returns a degenerate plan with an
  embedded `errors[]` — always check `plan.errors` before deploying.
- A harmless phantom `Power Distribution Device` can appear after deploy (off-canvas).

### ☠️ Never iterate a native PT object with `for...in`

```js
var d = lw.getEllipseItemData(id);
for (var k in d) { ... }   // ← CRASHES Packet Tracer. The whole app dies.
```

`try/catch` does **not** save you: this is not a JS exception, it is the script engine
blowing up and taking the process with it. Verified the hard way against PT 9.0.1 — the
app closed with "Cisco Packet Tracer quit unexpectedly".

Inspect native objects by calling **known getters** and stringifying the result, never by
enumerating keys. If you don't know the shape, probe one accessor at a time.

### Drawing IS possible — `drawCircle` takes SEVEN arguments

```js
lw.drawCircle(x, y, ignored, diameter, 0, 0, 0)   // x,y = TOP-LEFT corner
```

Returns an ellipse id and really draws. With 3–6 arguments it throws, which is why it was
believed unusable — same failure mode as `setHideDevLabel` (needs 2, not 1): the call was
fine, the **arity** was wrong. The old note that "the size argument controls stacking order"
came from passing the size in slot 3; **slot 4 is the diameter** and slot 3 is ignored.

Calibrated on PT 9.0.1 at default zoom: the drawn diameter is roughly **0.71 ×** the argument,
so to circle a LAN centred at `cx` use `drawCircle(cx - 173, y, 0, 480, 0,0,0)`. Don't compute
it blind — draw, `pt_screenshot`, adjust. Clear with `pt_clear_annotations` (it removes
drawings too, so redraw circles after clearing notes).

Colours still don't work: the last three arguments accept values but the ellipse comes out
with the default outline.

### Verified against PT 9.0.1 (audit round 2)

- **The bridge starts lazily.** After the MCP server restarts (a `/mcp` reconnect), nothing is
  listening on `:54321` until the first `pt_*` call — importing the server deliberately opens no
  socket. So "not connected" right after a reconnect usually means *nobody has called a tool yet*,
  **not** that the extension died: just call `pt_bridge_status` and PT resumes polling in seconds.
  Don't ask the user to reopen MCP BUILDER before trying that.
- **`getClassName()` is useless for telling a switch from a router.** PT classifies by behaviour:
  a 3560 answers `"Router"` (it is multilayer) and a 2960 answers `"CiscoDevice"` — neither ever
  says "switch". Use `getModel()` and resolve it against the catalog.
- **`addModule()` returns `false` instead of throwing** when the slot does not exist on that model.
  Check the return value; a silent `false` used to be reported as a successful install. `pt_add_module`
  and `pt_install_modules_batch` now verify it and report `installed` / `failed` per module.
- **Renaming to a name that is already taken used to be allowed** and left two devices sharing it,
  with `getDevice(name)` resolving only to one — the other became unreachable by name. Now rejected.

### Verified against PT 9.0.1 (audit round 3)

- **A router deployed by the MCP has never been touched through its console**, so it is still parked at
  `Would you like to enter the initial configuration dialog? [yes/no]:`. A `ping` sent there is eaten as
  the yes/no answer and never runs. Prime it first: send `no`, then an empty command to clear
  `Press RETURN to get started.` (`pt_verify_connectivity` now does this for you.)
- **An IOS interface with no IP address stays shut down.** The CLI generator only emits `no shutdown`
  for addressed interfaces, so a link you cabled but never addressed shows up as a red triangle on the
  canvas and as a down link in `pt_health_check`. Give it an address, even a throwaway `/30`.
- **PT does not associate a wireless host with the nearest AP.** Measured: a laptop with its own LAN's
  AP right beside it did a *fresh* association and a *fresh* DHCP and still chose the AP of another LAN,
  taking that LAN's address. Between APs sharing the default SSID the choice is arbitrary, and there is
  no SSID API to force it (neither the AP nor its port has `setSsid`). If you need deterministic
  addressing, use `wireless_laptops=False` and cable the laptops.
- **`PT_MCP_BRIDGE_TOKEN` is validated.** If the server refuses to start with `BridgeTokenError`, the
  variable is set to something shorter than 32 chars or outside `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`. Fix it or unset it so
  the on-disk token is used. It fails loudly on purpose: a bad value there would disable the only real
  defence the bridge has.
- **The layout adapts to the busiest LAN.** Coordinates no longer go negative and LAN clusters no longer
  overlap, so you do not need to reposition devices by hand after `pt_full_build` — only if you want a
  specific arrangement.

## Recipes

- *"2 routers, 2 switches, 4 PCs, DHCP, static"* → `pt_full_build(routers=2, switches_per_router=1,
  pcs_per_lan=2, dhcp=True, routing="static", deploy=True)`.
- 4 serial ports on R1 (2911) → `pt_install_modules_batch([{device:"R1",slot:"0/0",module:"HWIC-2T"},
  {device:"R1",slot:"0/1",module:"HWIC-2T"}])`.
- Block telnet to a server on R1 → `pt_apply_acl(router="R1", name_or_number="101", acl_type="extended",
  entries=[{action:"deny",protocol:"tcp",source:"any",destination:"host 192.168.0.10",dest_port_op:"eq",
  dest_port:23},{action:"permit",protocol:"ip",source:"any",destination:"any"}],
  binding_interface="GigabitEthernet0/0", binding_direction="in", dry_run=True)` — preview first.
- Read a device's ports safely → `pt_send_raw('try{var d=ipc.network().getDevice("R1");reportResult(d?d.getPorts().join(","):"missing")}catch(e){reportResult("ERR:"+e)}', wait_result=True)`.
