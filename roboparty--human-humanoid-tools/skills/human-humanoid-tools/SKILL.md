description: Run local HHTools H2R through Newton or Interaction-Mesh, scene-free R2R, scalable H2R/R2R batches, and validated H2R or robot-pair calibration through the versioned MCP Agent interface: inspect allowlisted assets, generate content-bound calibration candidates, review front/side previews with GPT vision, silently save only validated poses, preflight immutable smoke/full plans, manage jobs, and review verified artifacts. Use for HHTools H2R/R2R/Batch/calibration execution, status, cancellation, retry, or result requests. Do not use for UI or solver-code edits, scene-bearing R2R, arbitrary filesystem access, remote service setup, or real-robot deployment. Use when this capability is needed.

# HHTools Agent

Operate HHTools through its MCP tools and resources while preserving the service's asset,
plan, job, and artifact identities. Treat solver completion and motion quality as separate
claims.

## Choose the workflow

- For a new H2R run, follow the smoke-first workflow below, including automatic calibration when
  the selected robot/reference profile is missing or invalid.
- For a new scene-free R2R run, follow the R2R-specific identity and pair-calibration checks below,
  then use the same job and artifact lifecycle.
- For a new H2R or scene-free R2R batch, preflight every item first, then follow the scalable
  batch workflow below.
- For an asset-only request, discover or register the asset, inspect it, and report the
  structured inspection without starting a job.
- For an existing job with a known `job_id`, start with `get_job`; do not recreate its inputs or
  submit another job. If an earlier start response was lost, recover only that caller-owned
  submission with `lookup_job` using its exact recorded `plan_id` and idempotency key.
- For a status or result request, poll only that job and read only its job-scoped artifacts.
- For cancellation or retry, require an explicit user request and follow the lifecycle rules in
  [errors and stops](references/errors-and-stops.md).

If the HHTools MCP tools are unavailable, stop and explain that the local MCP integration must
be configured. Never substitute shell commands, the JSON CLI, REST calls, or direct filesystem
reads. The stdio server owns its service runtime and does not require `hhtools web` to be
running. Only one local runtime may own a given `save_dir`. Calibration tools run inside that
same owner; do not start a second WebUI merely to calibrate. The WebUI remains a fallback for a
human-only action and must never run concurrently or expose its session token.

## Run a new H2R job

1. Call `get_capabilities`. Confirm the MCP feature, supported formats/backend, scheduler state,
   allowlisted `asset_root_ids`, and robot readiness. Do not infer a GPU or backend that the
   response does not report.
2. Resolve both content-addressed inputs.
   - Prefer `search_assets` for an already registered motion or robot bundle.
   - If no matching bundle is registered, call `list_available_assets` with bounded filters.
     Select only a returned candidate, then call `register_asset_bundle` with one `request`
     containing `schema_version: "1.0"` plus its `root_id`, `relative_path`, `display_name`,
     `kind`, `category`, and `recursive` fields. Never browse a root, pass, or derive an absolute
     host path.
   - Register only with `register_asset_bundle` using the catalog's portable identity.
   - Call `inspect_asset_bundle` with hash verification and parsing enabled for every selected
     motion and robot bundle. Stop on `invalid`; surface warnings before continuing.
   - Continue only when category and backend agree: `plain_motion` uses `newton`, while
     `object_interaction` and `terrain_scene` use `interaction_mesh`. Never override the
     inspected routing identity. Stop when content inspection requires isolated validation;
     do not decode a rejected code-capable source format yourself.
   - Select a supported `robot_id` from `list_robots` or the capability snapshot and pair it with
     the inspected robot bundle's `asset_id`. Do not guess either identity.
   - Use the motion inspection's exact reference to call `get_calibration_status` before
     preflight. For `missing` or `invalid`, complete the automatic calibration workflow below;
     do not let mere calibration-file existence stand in for quality validation.
3. Call `preflight_retarget` with a versioned `RetargetPreflightRequest`. Put
   `run_mode: smoke` in `request.parameters`, use the currently supported
   `output_policy: create_new`, and include the registered motion and robot asset IDs. Other
   output policies are rejected in this phase.
4. Branch on the preflight `status`.
   - `ready`: retain the returned immutable smoke `plan_id` and continue.
   - `human_action_required` with `CALIBRATION_REQUIRED`: when calibration capabilities are
     advertised, follow the automatic calibration workflow below inside the current MCP runtime,
     then perform a new preflight. For another human action, pause and present it unchanged.
   - `rejected`: inspect the structured error and checks. Execute an `actor: agent` action only
     when it matches the allowlisted action mapping below; otherwise stop and explain it.
5. Generate one caller-owned idempotency key for this logical submission. Call
   `start_job(request={schema_version: "1.0", plan_id, idempotency_key})`; the nested request
   contains only the ready plan identity and key. `start_retarget` remains a compatibility alias.
   Persist the exact pair before submission. If the transport result is ambiguous, call
   `lookup_job` with that pair before replaying the exact same start request; never enumerate jobs
   or create a replacement key.
6. Wait with `wait_job(job_id, after_revision=<last revision>, timeout=30)`. Treat `queued` and
   `running` as nonterminal, retain the returned revision, and wait again without busy-polling.
   Use `get_job` only for an immediate snapshot when no wait is appropriate. Report
   queue/progress changes without requesting large trajectories.
7. At terminal state, use `list_job_artifacts(job_id, ...)` for canonical membership, then read
   `hhtools://jobs/{job_id}/artifacts/{artifact_id}` when one descriptor needs verification. Read
   `hhtools://jobs/{job_id}/evaluation`, `/manifest`, and `/failures` only when relevant.
   Resources expose verified structured reports or descriptors, not binary motion bytes. When the
   user asks for an artifact file, call `export_artifact(job_id, artifact_id)`: it verifies and
   materializes the file below the fixed `agent-exports` root and returns a portable receipt. Give
   the receipt to the user; do not inspect private storage or request bytes in model context.
8. Inspect both `state` and `outcome`. `completed` alone is not quality approval. For a completed
   job, present the evaluation and manifest and pause on `review_required`, `partial`, or
   `rejected`. For `failed` or `cancelled`, follow the error rules and read failure/manifest
   resources only when present.
9. Start a full run only after explicit user approval of the smoke evidence. Perform a new
   preflight with `request.parameters.run_mode: full`, receive a different immutable full plan,
   and submit it with a new idempotency key. Never promote or mutate the smoke plan.

## Auto-calibrate H2R with deterministic checks and GPT vision

1. Confirm `calibration_status`, `calibration_proposals`, `calibration_validation`, and
   `calibration_silent_save` in capabilities. Use the exact inspected `robot_id`,
   `robot_asset_id`, and reference family. Include `motion_asset_id` only for a clip-specific
   `glb` reference.
2. Call `get_calibration_status`. A `valid` manual calibration or `bundled` scaler may proceed to
   fresh preflight. For `missing` or `invalid`, call `propose_calibration` with the same identity.
   A request to run automatic calibration authorizes a validated silent save; a status-only
   request does not.
3. Retain the complete returned candidate and its content-addressed `candidate_id`. Never edit a
   candidate document or invent an id. To revise it, call `propose_calibration` again with
   `base_candidate_id`, explicit `joint_q_overrides`, and any joints that must remain fixed in
   `locked_joints`.
4. Call `validate_calibration`. Continue only when `valid: true`; an error-level mapping, limit,
   limb-alignment, or foot check blocks saving. Warnings must be included in the final audit.
5. If `calibration_visual_preview` is available and the current model can see images, call
   `preview_calibration`. Inspect the returned MCP image block directly—never copy its Base64 into
   text or arguments. Check both front and side views for coherent limbs, bilateral symmetry,
   upright trunk, level feet, and obvious semantic-target mistakes. Perform at most three
   candidate-revision rounds; stop and ask the user if no candidate passes.
6. After deterministic validation and a passing visual inspection, call `save_calibration` with
   `save_mode: gpt_vision_silent` and a concise `visual_review` whose reviewer is `gpt_vision`,
   verdict is `pass`, and `model_hint` names the active model when known. The declaration is audit
   metadata, not authentication; never claim the server verified model identity. A client without
   image capability may use `validated_silent` only when automatic calibration was requested. If
   the save response is ambiguous, replay the exact same candidate, mode, and review; the write is
   deterministic, archives the previous calibration when one exists, and refuses a changed
   baseline.
7. Keep the save receipt, then rerun `get_calibration_status` and `preflight_retarget`. Silent save
   authorizes only the calibration file; it never authorizes a full run or physical deployment.

## Auto-calibrate an R2R robot pair

1. Confirm all five `r2r_calibration_*` capability flags. Bind every request to the exact inspected
   source and target robot IDs and asset IDs; never substitute either member of the pair.
2. Call `get_r2r_calibration_status`. For `missing` or `invalid`, call
   `propose_r2r_calibration` with that same pair. The service derives the semantic reference from
   source-robot zero-configuration FK and proposes only target-robot joint values.
3. Retain the immutable R2R `candidate_id`. Revise only through `propose_r2r_calibration` with its
   `base_candidate_id`, explicit overrides, and locked joints. Never pass an H2R candidate to an
   R2R tool or reuse a candidate with another robot pair.
4. Call `validate_r2r_calibration`; continue only on `valid: true`. When image input is available,
   call `preview_r2r_calibration` and inspect both views under the same three-round limit used for
   H2R. Blue is the source reference and orange is the target pose.
5. Save with `save_r2r_calibration` under the same `validated_silent` or
   `gpt_vision_silent` rules as H2R. The service writes a target user overlay, archives a previous
   pair file, rejects a changed baseline, and makes an exact replay idempotent.
6. Rerun `get_r2r_calibration_status`, then perform a fresh `preflight_r2r` so the exact new pair
   calibration digest is frozen into the plan. This save grants no full-run or deployment approval.

## Run a new scene-free R2R job

1. Confirm `r2r_preflight` and `r2r_execution` in capabilities and select the advertised backend.
2. Resolve and inspect exactly three bundles: one `robot_trajectory_bundle`, its source robot, and
   the target robot. Require `category: robot_trajectory`, successful semantic parsing, a
   scene-free `mimic` trajectory profile, and an exact match between the trajectory's declared
   source robot and the selected source robot. Object or terrain sidecars are a stop condition.
3. Call `get_r2r_calibration_status` before preflight. For `missing` or `invalid`, complete the
   automatic pair-calibration workflow above. Then call `preflight_r2r` with the trajectory asset
   ID, source robot ID and asset ID, target robot ID and asset ID, `output_policy: create_new`, and
   `parameters.run_mode: smoke`. Retain the immutable R2R plan, which binds all three assets and
   the pair-calibration digest.
4. On `human_action_required` with `R2R_CALIBRATION_REQUIRED`, pass the exact returned Agent action
   into the automatic pair-calibration flow and rerun preflight. On `rejected`, do not switch
   robots, strip scene files, or override the trajectory's source identity.
5. Submit a ready plan with `start_job`; then follow H2R steps 6–9 for revision-aware waiting,
   artifact verification, human quality review, and a separately approved full plan.

## Run an H2R or R2R batch

1. Create a ready smoke child plan for every requested item with `preflight_retarget` or
   `preflight_r2r`. Keep the user's order. Every child must use a unique input, the same workflow,
   the same run mode, and the same target robot; R2R children must also use the same source robot.
2. Call `preflight_batch` with `schema_version: "1.0"`, `workflow: h2r` or `r2r`, the ordered
   `item_plan_ids`, and `output_policy: create_new`. Do not pass asset paths or rebuild child
   identities. Batch item/frame caps are administrator settings where `0` means unlimited; the
   default is unlimited. Items execute serially within the job.
3. Start only a `ready` batch plan with `start_job`. During `wait_job`, report
   `completed_items / total_items`; never expect an unbounded per-item array in job status.
4. Cancellation is cooperative for the current child and prevents every not-yet-started child.
   A retry is a new whole-batch attempt; never silently retry only failed items.
5. At completion, read `hhtools://jobs/{job_id}/batch`, plus failures, evaluation, and manifest
   when present. `partial` means some children failed. Each successful child still requires
   quality review. Export the `batch_archive` artifact for one portable ZIP delivery.
6. A full batch requires explicit approval and new full child plans for every item, followed by a
   new `preflight_batch`, batch plan, and idempotency key. Never mix smoke and full child plans.

## Execute allowlisted agent actions

The automatic preflight recovery mappings are:

| Returned action | MCP operation | Required behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `actor: agent`, `action: register_asset_bundle` | `register_asset_bundle` | Pass `next_action.parameters` unchanged as the tool arguments. It must contain exactly one `request` matching `AssetRegistrationRequest`. Inspect the returned robot bundle, replace `robot_asset_id` with its `asset_id`, and perform a new preflight. |
| `actor: agent`, `action: get_calibration_status` | `get_calibration_status` | Pass `next_action.parameters` unchanged. Continue through the automatic calibration workflow only for the exact returned robot bundle and reference. |
| `actor: agent`, `action: get_r2r_calibration_status` | `get_r2r_calibration_status` | Pass `next_action.parameters` unchanged. Continue only with the exact returned source and target robot bundles. |

Do not translate semantic action names, derive a host path, enumerate directories, or repair a
malformed action. If the action name, wrapper shape, `root_id`, or portable `relative_path` does
not validate against the live tool schema, stop and present the contract error.

## Non-negotiable invariants

| ID | Rule |
|---|---|
| `MCP_ONLY` | Use HHTools MCP tools/resources only; never fall back to shell, JSON CLI, REST, or direct service imports. |
| `ALLOWLISTED_ASSETS` | Asset registration accepts only a capability-advertised `root_id` plus normalized `relative_path`, never an arbitrary or absolute path. |
| `H2R_BACKEND_ROUTING` | Use `newton` only for inspected `plain_motion`; use `interaction_mesh` only for inspected object interaction or terrain scenes, and never bypass isolated content validation. |
| `R2R_INITIAL_SCOPE` | R2R accepts only semantically inspected, scene-free robot trajectories whose declared source identity matches the selected source robot. |
| `SCALABLE_BATCH` | Batch accepts only ordered ready child plans from one workflow and run mode, with common robot identities and unique inputs; optional administrator caps use 0 for unlimited, while retry remains whole-batch. |
| `PREFLIGHT_OWNS_MODE` | `run_mode` belongs in preflight `request.parameters`; `start_job` accepts only `plan_id` and `idempotency_key`. |
| `OUTPUT_CREATE_NEW` | Use `output_policy: create_new`; other output policies are unsupported in the current Agent service. |
| `IDEMPOTENT_START` | Persist the exact plan and idempotency key, recover with `lookup_job`, and replay an ambiguous start only with that same plan and idempotency key; never create a second key for the same logical submission. |
| `IDEMPOTENT_RETRY` | Replay an ambiguous retry with the exact same parent job and retry idempotency key; never create a second child attempt. |
| `NEW_FULL_PLAN` | A full run requires explicit approval, a new full preflight, a new plan, and a new idempotency key. |
| `JOB_SCOPED_ARTIFACTS` | List, resolve, or export an artifact with both `job_id` and `artifact_id`; never trust or expose an unbound artifact identity. |
| `CONTROLLED_MEDIA_CONTEXT` | Keep binary motion, meshes, video, trajectories, and Base64 out of arguments and text; only `preview_calibration` and `preview_r2r_calibration` may return an MCP image block, while files use `export_artifact`. |
| `VALIDATED_CALIBRATION` | Never fabricate or edit a candidate id; save only a currently valid candidate, require a passing image review for `gpt_vision_silent`, record warnings, and run fresh preflight afterward. |
| `SILENT_SAVE_SCOPE` | An automatic-calibration request permits validated calibration save without another prompt, but does not approve a full job, motion quality, or real-robot deployment. |
| `COOPERATIVE_CANCEL` | Running cancellation is a request checked at safe points; do not claim cancellation until the returned job state is terminal. |
| `HONEST_PROVENANCE` | Report only device and execution provenance present in capabilities or the manifest; never infer actual GPU use. |
| `SINGLE_RUNTIME_OWNER` | One local runtime may own a `save_dir`; use in-process calibration tools while MCP owns it, and never start a same-directory WebUI concurrently. |
| `LOCAL_BOUNDARY` | This skill covers local stdio only, with a loopback calibration UI. It provides no remote auth, multi-user isolation, worker resume, or real-robot deployment. |

## Load references progressively

- Read [contracts](references/contracts.md) before constructing an unfamiliar tool request,
  selecting a schema resource, or interpreting an artifact.
- Read [errors and stops](references/errors-and-stops.md) for every non-ready preflight,
  failed/partial/review-required job, cancellation, retry, hash failure, or ambiguous tool call.

## Report the result

Return a compact audit trail: selected input and robot asset IDs (including both R2R robots), run
mode and plan ID, job ID and lineage, final state/outcome, evaluation verdict, artifact IDs with hashes when
available, calibration candidate/validation/save receipt when applicable, batch counts/report, any
artifact export receipt requested by the user, and any remaining human action.
Explicitly label unverified quality, unavailable actual-device provenance, and unsupported remote
or real-robot steps.
