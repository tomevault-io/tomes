Perform a pre-coding security review for the following task:

$ARGUMENTS

---

## What to do

Analyze the task description above and produce a structured security assessment. If no task description was provided in the arguments, ask the user to describe what they are building and optionally their tech stack before proceeding.

### Step 1 — Identify Technologies

Detect technologies from the description:
- Languages: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, Ruby, PHP, Rust, C#
- Frameworks: Django, FastAPI, Flask, Express, Next.js, Spring, Rails, Laravel
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, SQLite, DynamoDB
- Auth: JWT, OAuth2, SAML, session-based, API keys
- Infrastructure: AWS, GCP, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes
- Other: GraphQL, REST API, gRPC, WebSockets, message queues

### Step 2 — Assess Risk Level

**Critical** — payments/financial transactions, healthcare/PHI, authentication system, cryptographic key management, admin functionality, multi-tenant data isolation

**High** — PII collection/storage, file uploads, external API integrations, session management, password handling, OAuth flows, database schema changes

**Medium** — user-generated content, search functionality, data exports, email/notification systems, third-party SDKs, internal APIs

**Low** — static content, read-only public data, internal tooling with no sensitive data

### Step 3 — Identify Security Categories

Select all applicable:
- `authentication` — login, registration, password reset, MFA
- `authorization` — access control, roles, permissions, IDOR
- `data_validation` — input validation, sanitization, output encoding
- `cryptography` — encryption, hashing, key management, TLS
- `api_security` — endpoints, rate limiting, CORS, versioning
- `web_security` — XSS, CSRF, clickjacking, CSP
- `database` — SQL injection, ORM, connection security
- `secrets_management` — credentials, env vars, vaults
- `error_handling` — information disclosure, stack traces
- `logging` — audit trails, sensitive data in logs
- `cloud_security` — IAM, S3 permissions, VPC, security groups
- `supply_chain_security` — dependencies, lockfiles

### Step 4 — Apply OWASP Guidelines

For each identified category, provide specific, actionable guidance:

**Authentication:** Use bcrypt/argon2 for passwords; implement account lockout; secure HttpOnly SameSite cookies; rotate session tokens after login; enforce MFA for high-privilege actions.

**Authorization:** Validate permissions server-side on every request; deny-by-default; avoid direct object references; check ownership before granting access.

**Data Validation:** Validate and sanitize ALL user input server-side; use allowlists not denylists; encode output based on context (HTML, JS, SQL, URL); validate file uploads by type, size, and content.

**Cryptography:** AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 for encryption; SHA-256+ for hashing (never MD5/SHA1 for security); cryptographically secure random for tokens; never hardcode keys.

**API Security:** Authenticate all sensitive endpoints; rate limit per user and per IP; validate Content-Type; return generic error messages (no stack traces in production); HTTPS + HSTS.

**Injection Prevention:** Parameterized queries/prepared statements for SQL; avoid eval()/exec() with user input; subprocess with shell=False (Python); sanitize data in OS commands, LDAP, XML, HTML.

**Secrets Management:** Never commit secrets to git; use environment variables or secrets manager (Vault, AWS SSM); rotate credentials regularly; scan commits for accidental exposure.

### Step 5 — Output

Produce this exact structure:

---

## Pre-Coding Security Review

**Task:** [task description]
**Risk Level:** [LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH | CRITICAL]
**Tech Stack Detected:** [list or "not specified"]
**Security Categories:** [comma-separated list]

### Risk Summary
[2–3 sentences explaining why this risk level was assigned and what the primary security concerns are for this specific task]

### Security Requirements

For each identified category:

#### [Category Name]
- [Specific requirement 1 — concrete, not generic]
- [Specific requirement 2]

### Pre-Coding Checklist
- [ ] [Check 1 — most critical for this task]
- [ ] [Check 2]
- [ ] [Check N — aim for 5–8 checks, task-specific]

### Prompt Injection for AI Code Generation

Copy this into your prompt when asking an AI to generate code for this task:

```
SECURITY REQUIREMENTS — apply throughout all generated code:

Risk Level: [RISK LEVEL]

[Bulleted list of the top 5–7 security requirements written as direct instructions to an AI code generator, specific to this task]
