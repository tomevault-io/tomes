# PR Comment Handler

Guide to find the open PR for the current branch and address its comments with gh CLI.

**Prerequisites:** Ensure `gh` is authenticated before running commands. Check authentication status with `gh auth status`. If not authenticated, instruct the user to run `gh auth login` to authenticate with GitHub.

## 1) Inspect comments needing attention

- Run scripts/fetch_comments.py which will print out all the comments and review threads on the PR

## 2) Ask the user for clarification

- Number all the review threads and comments and provide a short summary of what would be required to apply a fix for it
- Ask the user which numbered comments should be addressed

## 3) If user chooses comments

- Apply fixes for the selected comments

Notes:

- If gh hits auth/rate issues mid-run, prompt the user to re-authenticate with `gh auth login`, then retry.
