# Prompt Optimizer

This skill analyzes user prompts and provides optimized versions that are clearer, more specific, and more actionable.

## Purpose

Transform vague, incomplete, or ambiguous user requests into well-structured prompts that lead to better outcomes. By analyzing prompts against quality criteria and providing optimized versions, this skill helps users communicate their needs more effectively.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when user prompts exhibit one or more of these issues:

### Clarity Issues
- Vague language: "something", "thing", "stuff", "it", "this"
- Ambiguous pronouns without clear referents
- Multiple possible interpretations
- Unclear desired outcome

### Specificity Issues
- Missing context about the problem domain
- No technical specifications (language, framework, version)
- Lack of examples when examples would help
- Undefined scope or boundaries

### Completeness Issues
- Missing required information or inputs
- No success criteria defined
- Undefined behavior for edge cases
- Missing constraints or requirements

### Structure Issues
- Disorganized information
- Complex requests without clear structure
- Mixing context with requests
- No logical flow

### Actionability Issues
- No clear action verb or request
- Passive voice making intent unclear
- Confusing or conflicting instructions
- Missing output format specification

## Activation Triggers

Activate this skill when detecting:
- Vague words: "something", "thing", "stuff", "it", "this", "that"
- Quality indicators: "better", "good", "nice" (without criteria)
- Incomplete requests: "help with...", "can you...", "fix..." (without details)
- Overly broad requests: "build an app", "create a system"
- Missing specifications in technical requests
- Requests without clear success criteria

## Analysis Workflow

**Two modes available:**

### Mode 1: Interactive Questionnaire (Recommended for Complex Requests)
Use the AskUserQuestion tool to guide users through structured questions. This collaborative approach helps users clarify their needs step-by-step.

**When to use**: Medium to complex requests, or when user prefers guided interaction.

### Mode 2: Direct Analysis (Fast)
Analyze the prompt and provide suggested improvements in one response.

**When to use**: Simple optimization needs, or when user wants quick results.

**Default**: Start with Mode 2 (Direct Analysis). If user requests interactive mode or if the request is very complex, switch to Mode 1.

---

## Mode 2: Direct Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Receive and Read the Prompt

Carefully read the user's original prompt to understand their intent.

### Step 2: Identify Issues

Systematically check for issues using `references/optimization-principles.md`:

**Clarity Check**:
- Is the language specific and concrete?
- Are all terms clearly defined?
- Is there only one reasonable interpretation?

**Specificity Check**:
- Is sufficient context provided?
- Are technical requirements specified?
- Are examples included when helpful?

**Completeness Check**:
- Is all necessary information present?
- Are success criteria defined?
- Are edge cases considered?

**Structure Check**:
- Is information organized logically?
- Is the request easy to parse?
- Is context separated from the task?

**Actionability Check**:
- Is there a clear action requested?
- Is the output format specified?
- Are instructions unambiguous?

### Step 3: Categorize Issues

List all identified issues by category:
- Clarity problems: [list]
- Specificity gaps: [list]
- Completeness deficiencies: [list]
- Structure issues: [list]
- Actionability concerns: [list]

### Step 4: Generate Optimized Prompt

Create an improved version following these principles:

**Add Specificity**:
- Replace vague terms with concrete descriptions
- Add missing technical specifications
- Include relevant context

**Improve Clarity**:
- Use clear, unambiguous language
- Define all terms
- Eliminate multiple interpretations

**Ensure Completeness**:
- Add missing requirements
- Define success criteria
- Specify constraints

**Enhance Structure**:
- Organize information logically
- Use bullet points and sections
- Separate context from task

**Make Actionable**:
- Start with clear action verb
- Specify output format
- Provide concrete deliverables

Reference `references/optimization-principles.md` for patterns and examples.

### Step 5: Present Analysis

Provide a structured response:

1. **Original Prompt**: Show the user's original request

2. **Identified Issues**: List specific problems found
   - Categorized by type
   - Brief explanation of each

3. **Optimized Prompt**: Provide improved version
   - Well-structured
   - Complete
   - Actionable

4. **Key Improvements**: Highlight main changes
   - What was added
   - What was clarified
   - Why it's better

5. **Optional**: Offer to refine further or proceed with the optimized prompt

## Mode 1: Interactive Questionnaire Workflow

### When User Requests Interactive Mode

If the user explicitly asks for interactive/questionnaire mode, or if the prompt has multiple complex issues, use this workflow.

### Step 1: Quick Initial Analysis

Quickly identify the main categories of missing information:
- Technical specifications needed?
- Functional requirements unclear?
- Design/styling preferences missing?
- Scope or constraints undefined?

### Step 2: Design Question Set

Based on the analysis, prepare 1-4 targeted questions using AskUserQuestion tool.

**Question Structure**:
- Each question should have a clear header (max 12 chars)
- Provide 2-4 specific options
- Include descriptions explaining each option
- Allow "Other" for custom input (automatically provided)

**Question Categories**:

**For Code Requests**:
1. Technology Stack (React, Vue, vanilla JS, etc.)
2. Type System (TypeScript, JavaScript)
3. Styling Approach (Tailwind, CSS Modules, styled-components, etc.)
4. Feature Requirements (specific functionality needed)

**For Component Requests**:
1. Component Type (Button, Form, Card, Modal, etc.)
2. Variants Needed (primary/secondary, sizes, states)
3. Props/API (what should it accept?)
4. Use Cases (how will it be used?)

**For UI/Design Requests**:
1. Platform (Web, Mobile, Desktop app)
2. Design Style (Modern, Minimal, Colorful, Corporate)
3. Responsive Needs (Mobile-first, Desktop-only, Adaptive)
4. Key Features (what must be included?)

### Step 3: Use AskUserQuestion Tool

Call the AskUserQuestion tool with structured questions.

**Important**: Always include a final open-ended question that allows users to add custom requirements using the "Other" option.

```typescript
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [
    {
      question: "What technology stack should this use?",
      header: "Tech Stack",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        {
          label: "React + TypeScript",
          description: "Modern React with full type safety"
        },
        {
          label: "React + JavaScript",
          description: "React without TypeScript"
        },
        {
          label: "Vue 3",
          description: "Vue 3 Composition API"
        },
        {
          label: "Vanilla JavaScript",
          description: "Plain JS without frameworks"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      question: "What styling approach would you like?",
      header: "Styling",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        {
          label: "Tailwind CSS",
          description: "Utility-first CSS framework"
        },
        {
          label: "CSS Modules",
          description: "Scoped CSS with modules"
        },
        {
          label: "styled-components",
          description: "CSS-in-JS solution"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      question: "Which features are needed?",
      header: "Features",
      multiSelect: true,
      options: [
        {
          label: "Multiple variants",
          description: "Different color/style variants (primary, secondary, etc.)"
        },
        {
          label: "Size options",
          description: "Different sizes (sm, md, lg)"
        },
        {
          label: "Loading state",
          description: "Show spinner during async operations"
        },
        {
          label: "Disabled state",
          description: "Disabled/inactive state"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      question: "Any additional requirements or constraints?",
      header: "Extra Needs",
      multiSelect: false,
      options: [
        {
          label: "No, that's all",
          description: "I don't need anything else"
        },
        {
          label: "Yes, let me specify",
          description: "I have additional requirements (use 'Other' to describe)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
})
```

**Note**: The "Other" option is automatically provided by AskUserQuestion tool, allowing users to input custom text for any question.

### Step 4: Process Answers

After receiving user's answers:
1. Extract all selected options from each question
2. Handle "Other" responses if user provided custom input
3. Pay special attention to the "Extra Needs" question:
   - If user selected "Yes, let me specify" and provided text in "Other", include those requirements
   - If user selected "No, that's all", proceed without additional requirements
4. Combine all answers with original request

### Step 5: Generate Optimized Prompt

Using the gathered information, create a complete, well-structured prompt:

```markdown
## Optimized Prompt (Based on Your Answers)

[Combine original intent + user's answers into structured prompt]

**Technology**: [Answer 1]
**Styling**: [Answer 2]
**Features**: [Answer 3, Answer 4, ...]

[Full detailed requirements...]
```

### Step 6: Confirm and Proceed

Ask user if the optimized prompt looks good, or if they want to adjust anything:

```markdown
### Does this look good?

1. ✅ Yes, proceed with this specification
2. 🔄 Let me adjust some details
3. ➕ Add more requirements
```

3. Focus on a specific aspect?
```

## Example Workflows

### Example 1: Vague Code Request

**User**: "Make a button"

**Analysis**:
- Missing: language/framework
- Missing: styling requirements
- Missing: functionality details
- Missing: props/API

**Optimized**:
```
Create a reusable Button component in React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

Requirements:
- Support variants: primary, secondary, danger
- Support sizes: sm, md, lg
- Accept onClick handler and children
- Include loading and disabled states
- Proper TypeScript types for all props

Example usage:
<Button variant="primary" size="md" onClick={handleClick}>
  Click me
</Button>
```

### Example 2: Incomplete Bug Report

**User**: "The app crashes"

**Analysis**:
- Missing: where/when it crashes
- Missing: error message
- Missing: reproduction steps
- Missing: expected behavior

**Optimized**:
```
Debug and fix the crash in the Shopping Cart component.

Current behavior:
- App crashes when clicking "Checkout" button
- Only when cart has more than 5 items
- Console error: "Cannot read property 'price' of undefined"

Location:
- File: src/components/ShoppingCart.tsx
- Started after recent pricing logic refactor

Expected behavior:
- Checkout button should work regardless of cart size
- Should navigate to checkout page

Steps to reproduce:
1. Add 6+ items to cart
2. Click "Checkout" button
3. Observe crash
```

### Example 3: Broad Request

**User**: "Build a dashboard"

**Analysis**:
- Too broad, no scope
- Missing: what data to display
- Missing: technical requirements
- Missing: design requirements

**Optimized**:
```
Create a responsive analytics dashboard with the following requirements:

Data to Display:
- User statistics (total users, active users, new signups)
- Revenue metrics (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Traffic sources (chart showing breakdown)
- Recent activity feed

Technical Requirements:
- React with TypeScript
- Chart library: Chart.js or Recharts
- State management: Zustand
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)

Features:
- Date range filter
- Data refresh button
- CSV export functionality
- Loading states for data fetching

Layout:
- Grid layout with stat cards at top
- Charts in middle section
- Activity feed on the side or bottom
```

## Quality Criteria Reference

Consult `references/optimization-principles.md` for:

- **Prompt Quality Checklist** - Systematic evaluation criteria
- **Common Prompt Patterns** - Templates for different request types
- **Red Flags** - Indicators of poor prompt quality
- **Optimization Strategies** - Techniques by problem type
- **Full Examples** - Before/after optimization examples

## Special Cases

### When the Prompt is Already Good

If the user's prompt is already clear, specific, and complete:
1. Acknowledge the quality of the prompt
2. Note what makes it effective
3. Proceed directly with the task
4. Don't over-optimize

### When Clarification is Needed

If critical information is missing and cannot be reasonably assumed:
1. Identify what's missing
2. Ask targeted clarifying questions
3. Provide options when applicable
4. Suggest a framework for their answer

### When Multiple Interpretations Exist

If the prompt is ambiguous:
1. Identify the different possible interpretations
2. Present them clearly to the user
3. Ask which interpretation is correct
4. Or suggest the most likely interpretation and ask for confirmation

### When the Request is Too Broad

If the scope is unrealistic:
1. Break it down into phases or components
2. Suggest starting with a specific part
3. Provide a prioritized list
4. Recommend an MVP approach

## Integration with Other Skills

### Before Other Skills Activate

This skill can serve as a "pre-processor":
1. Optimize the prompt first
2. The optimized prompt then triggers appropriate skills
3. Other skills work with clearer requirements

### Working with request-analyzer

When `request-analyzer` skill is available:
- `request-analyzer` identifies when optimization is needed
- `prompt-optimizer` performs the optimization
- `request-analyzer` can then re-analyze the optimized prompt

## Best Practices

1. **Be helpful, not pedantic** - Focus on meaningful improvements
2. **Maintain user intent** - Don't change what they're asking for
3. **Add value** - Only optimize when it genuinely helps
4. **Be concise** - Don't over-explain obvious changes
5. **Stay respectful** - Frame as helpful enhancement, not criticism
6. **Offer options** - When multiple valid interpretations exist
7. **Know when to skip** - If prompt is already good, proceed directly

## Important Notes

- Always preserve the user's core intent and goals
- Don't make assumptions about technical choices unless necessary
- Clearly mark assumptions when made
- Offer to refine based on user feedback
- Sometimes asking a clarifying question is better than assuming
- Balance between thoroughness and practicality
- The goal is better outcomes, not perfect prompts
