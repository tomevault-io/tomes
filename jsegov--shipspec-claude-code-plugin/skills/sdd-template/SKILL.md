# Software Design Document Template

Create comprehensive technical design documents following the Atlassian 8-section structure.

## Document Structure Overview

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| 1. Introduction | Purpose, scope, definitions |
| 2. System Overview | High-level architecture |
| 3. Design Considerations | Assumptions, constraints, risks |
| 4. Architectural Strategies | Key decisions and alternatives |
| 5. System Architecture | Components, data flow, APIs, models |
| 6. Policies and Tactics | Security, error handling, logging |
| 7. Detailed Design | Component-level specifications |
| 8. Appendix | Diagrams, glossary |

## Section Templates

### Section 1: Introduction

```markdown

```

### Section 4: Architectural Strategies

```markdown
## 4. Architectural Strategies

### 4.1 Strategy Selection
[Why this architecture was chosen over alternatives]

### 4.2 Alternatives Considered
| Option | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| [Option A] | [Pros] | [Cons] | Selected |
| [Option B] | [Pros] | [Cons] | Rejected |

| GET | /api/resource/:id | Get resource |

#### 5.3.2 Request/Response Schemas
[TypeScript interfaces or JSON schemas]

### 5.4 Data Models
[Database schema with types and constraints]
```

### Section 6: Policies and Tactics

```markdown

#### 7.1.2 Interface
[TypeScript interface or function signatures]

#### 7.1.3 Implementation Notes
[Specific implementation details, algorithms, or patterns]
```

### Section 8: Appendix

```markdown
## 8. Appendix

### 8.1 Sequence Diagrams
[For complex flows]

### 8.2 State Diagrams
[For stateful components]

### 8.3 Glossary
[Extended definitions]
```

## Requirement Traceability

Each design decision should trace to requirements:

```markdown
### REQ-001 Implementation
**Requirement:** [Quote requirement]
**Design:** [How this design satisfies it]
**Verification:** [How to test it]
```

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing an SDD:

- [ ] Every PRD requirement (REQ-XXX) is addressed
- [ ] Data models are complete with types and constraints
- [ ] API contracts are fully specified
- [ ] Error scenarios are documented
- [ ] Security considerations are addressed
- [ ] Performance requirements have corresponding strategies
- [ ] Dependencies are versioned
- [ ] Diagrams are included where helpful
