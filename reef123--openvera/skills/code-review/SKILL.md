# Code Review

Spawn a clean-context Claude subagent (`code-reviewer`) to adversarially review a file, directory, or git diff. The subagent returns findings as YAML; this skill formats them and (optionally) writes a review artifact.

**Use this when:**
- You want a second pair of eyes on a file before committing.
- You finished a build phase outside `/build full` and want a `code-review.md`-shape report.
- You want to review the last commit (`/code-review` with no args defaults to `HEAD~1..HEAD`).

**Don't use this for:**
- `/build full` Phase 6 — that pipeline still uses `Agent(subagent_type: "reviewer", ...)` internally, which writes `.build/review.md` in-flow. This skill is a sibling, not a replacement.
- Reviewing ideas or PRDs — use `/panel` for that.

**Cost:** Free-ish. The subagent uses your Claude Code plan tokens. No external API.

## Step 0: Parse arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` shapes:

| Shape | Example | Interpretation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| File path | `.claude/hooks/pre-compact.py` | Review that file |
| Directory path | `.claude/hooks/` | Review every file in it (cap: 10 files) |
| Git range | `HEAD~1..HEAD`, `main..HEAD`, `<sha>..<sha>` | Review the diff |
| Single ref | `HEAD`, `<sha>` | Review the commit's diff vs its parent |
| Empty | (no args) | Default to `HEAD~1..HEAD` |

Flags (any order):
- `--against <path>` — also pass `<path>` to the reviewer as alignment spec (PRD, tech spec, EARS acceptance criteria, etc.)
- `--write <path>` — after findings come back, render them into `templates/code-review.md` shape at `<path>`. Default: print to chat only.

If you can't tell whether an arg is a path or a git range, prefer path. Then fall back to git if the path doesn't exist.

---

## Step 1: Resolve the target

**For a path:**
- Single file → read the file content.
- Directory → glob `**/*.{py,ts,tsx,js,jsx,svelte,md,sh,yml,yaml,json}` (or anything else obviously code), cap at 10 files. If more, list them in chat and ask the user to narrow.

**For a git range:**
- `git diff <range>` — capture the diff output.
- If the range is a single ref (`HEAD`, `<sha>`), expand to `<ref>~1..<ref>`.

**Size guard:** If the captured content exceeds ~50KB (roughly 1500 lines of source or 1000 lines of diff), warn the user, list the largest files, and ask which subset to review. Do not silently truncate.

---

## Step 2: Spawn the reviewer subagent

```
Agent(
  subagent_type: "code-reviewer",
  description: "Code review <target>",
  prompt: <see below>
)
```

The prompt to the subagent has four parts:

1. **Role primer (one line):** `"You are a clean-context senior code reviewer. Follow the checklist and YAML schema in your agent definition. Return ONLY the YAML block."`
2. **Target context:** `"Target: <path-or-range>. Project: OpenVera (personal AI workbench, Markdown + Python harness scripts + Claude Code skills)."`
3. **The content:** The file content OR the diff output OR (for directories) each file's content concatenated with a `# === <path> ===` separator.
4. **(Optional) Spec:** If `--against <spec>` was provided, append `"Alignment spec follows. Compare the target against this:"` plus the spec content.

Keep the prompt under ~100KB total. The agent's checklist + schema live in its definition file, so don't restate them — just remind it to follow them.

---

## Step 3: Receive + display findings

The subagent returns a YAML block. Parse it.

**Print to chat in this shape:**

```
**Verdict:** <pass | pass-with-findings | fail>  ·  C: <n>  H: <n>  M: <n>  L: <n>
**Summary:** <one_liner from YAML>

### Critical
| # | File:Line | Finding | Fix |
|---|-----------|---------|-----|
| C1 | path:12 | <finding> | <fix> |

### High
... (same shape)

### Medium
...

### Low
...
```

Empty severity sections: omit the heading + table entirely (don't print empty headers).

If the YAML doesn't parse, surface the raw output and a one-line "subagent returned non-YAML — re-run with a smaller target or tighter prompt." Don't try to repair the YAML — the subagent should obey schema; if it doesn't, the prompt needs tightening.

---

## Step 4: Optional `--write`

If `--write <output-path>` was passed, write a Markdown file at that path matching `.claude/skills/build/templates/code-review.md` structure:

- Header (Reviewer: Vera, Date: today's date, Status from verdict)
- Review Summary (one_liner from YAML)
- Files Reviewed table (each file in the target)
- Findings — Critical / High / Medium / Low tables (same shape as Step 3)
- Checklist section: copy the checklist from the agent definition with each category marked ✓ (since the agent walks the full list)

Use the Write tool. Confirm the path is reachable (parent dir exists or is creatable).

---

## Step 5: Gate line

Print a single closing line:

```
Verdict: <pass | pass-with-findings | fail>. <N> Critical, <N> High. Run again on a different target, or fix and re-run on the same one.
```

That's it. No follow-up questions. The skill is one-shot.
