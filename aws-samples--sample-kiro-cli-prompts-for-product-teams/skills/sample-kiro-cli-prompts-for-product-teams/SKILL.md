# Interactive Prototype

Authoritative guide: `prompts/Prototype Creation Guide.md` (build order, interactivity, Step 9.5 post-build + syntax gate). Shared standards: `prompts/Shared Standards.md`.

Build order (strict): shared `[product-slug].css` → `DesignSystem_*.html` → Design Token Contract → screen manifest + sidebar shell + Content Link Map → `Screen_*.html` (one per screen) → `ScreenIndex_*.html`.

Chart libraries: download at build time into gitignored `documents/lib/`, then run the integrity gate (Step 9.5 check 4.5). Every screen: dependency-load guard + global error banner. Run the syntax gate before declaring any screen done. For parallel screen work, dispatch the `screen-builder` subagent (one per screen).
