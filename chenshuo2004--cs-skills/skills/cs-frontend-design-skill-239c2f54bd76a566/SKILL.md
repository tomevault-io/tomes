# Frontend Design

## Purpose

Use this skill to make frontend work feel like a real product, not a decorative mockup.

It helps Codex turn a vague UI request into a usable interface with clear business flow, information hierarchy, interaction states, responsive layout, and visual verification.

For CS Skills, this skill should act as the frontend product taste layer: practical, polished, workflow-first, and careful about verification.

## When To Use

- Build or revise a user-facing page, dashboard, admin panel, tool, editor, landing page, game UI, or prototype.
- Review a frontend change for layout, usability, visual hierarchy, responsive behavior, or missing states.
- Turn a PRD, rough idea, screenshot, or existing page into a working product interface.
- Add UI controls, navigation, charts, tables, upload flows, account tools, or visual workflow surfaces.
- Verify a local frontend in browser after implementation.

Do not use this skill for backend-only tasks, data migrations, API-only changes, or pure copy edits unless they affect the visible user experience.

## Core Workflow

1. Read the project docs, PRD, README, route notes, or task brief before touching UI.
2. Inspect the existing app: framework, routes, components, CSS system, assets, icons, and design conventions.
3. Map the user goal: input, output, primary action, state transitions, edge cases, and likely failure points.
4. Identify the product type: operational tool, dashboard, editor, consumer app, landing page, game, portfolio, or content site.
5. Design the first screen as the real working experience unless the user explicitly asks for a marketing page.
6. Implement with the repo's existing component library and style system first. Add dependencies only when the stack cannot reasonably handle the job.
7. Verify visually when a browser or dev server is available: page loads, key controls render, no blank state, no obvious console errors, and desktop/mobile layouts do not overlap.

## Product Fit

- Operational tools, dashboards, CRMs, upload tools, and admin screens should feel quiet, dense, and repeatable: clear hierarchy, compact controls, predictable tables/lists/forms, restrained decoration.
- Editors and creative tools should prioritize the work surface, toolbars, state visibility, undoable actions, and low-friction navigation.
- Dashboards should optimize for scanning, comparison, filters, drill-downs, and clearly labeled time or account context.
- Consumer apps should emphasize the main action, approachable language, lightweight empty states, and fast recovery from errors.
- Games and immersive experiences can use expressive visuals, motion, custom canvas/SVG/Three.js assets, and playful styling.
- Landing pages need a first-viewport brand or product signal, strong real imagery or generated bitmap media, and a hint of the next section visible below the hero.

## Controls

- Use icon buttons for common tool actions: save, upload, download, undo, redo, zoom, delete, settings, refresh, and search.
- Use tabs for views, segmented controls for modes, toggles or checkboxes for booleans, menus/selects for option sets, and sliders/steppers/inputs for numeric values.
- Use text buttons for clear commands, not as substitutes for familiar icons.
- Add tooltips for unfamiliar icon-only actions.
- Keep destructive actions explicit, confirmed, and recoverable when possible.

## Layout Rules

- Use full-width sections or unframed layouts for page structure. Use cards only for repeated items, modals, and genuinely framed tools.
- Do not nest cards inside cards.
- Keep cards at 8px radius or less unless the existing design system says otherwise.
- Set stable dimensions for fixed-format controls, boards, grids, tiles, counters, and toolbars so hover states, labels, and dynamic content do not shift layout.
- Use responsive grids, min/max constraints, and aspect ratios instead of viewport-scaled font sizes.
- Match heading scale to the container. Avoid hero-sized text inside compact panels.
- Ensure text never overlaps or spills out of buttons, cards, nav items, sidebars, tables, or panels. Wrap, shorten, or use smaller local typography when needed.

## Visual System

- Avoid one-note palettes. Do not let the interface become dominated by one hue family, especially purple gradients, dark slate/blue, beige/tan, or brown/orange.
- Use color to encode state and priority, not as decoration alone.
- Prefer real or generated bitmap imagery for sites where the subject matters.
- Avoid decorative gradient blobs, bokeh orbs, and generic SVG hero illustrations.
- Use lucide icons when available. If the project already uses another icon library, stay with it.
- Primary images should reveal the actual product, place, object, state, gameplay, or person instead of acting as vague atmosphere.

## Interaction Quality

- Build complete states: empty, loading, success, error, disabled, active/selected, and destructive confirmation where relevant.
- Keep primary workflows short and visible. Avoid hiding required actions behind unclear menus.
- For upload/account/network tools, show the current state next to the action: selected account, profile path, proxy status, last opened time, and next recommended step.
- Do not add visible instructional text that merely explains obvious UI mechanics. Use labels, state, and structure instead.
- Make repeated workflows efficient: predictable placement, keyboard-friendly controls when useful, and clear return paths.

## Verification Checklist

Before finalizing frontend work:

- Run the available build/typecheck/lint command when practical.
- Start or reuse the dev server if the app needs one.
- Verify the page in a browser when browser tooling is available.
- Check desktop and mobile widths for overlap, clipped text, unusable controls, and broken navigation.
- Confirm referenced assets load and images are not dark, blurred, overly cropped, or irrelevant.
- Report any verification blocker directly, distinguishing environment/tool failure from app failure.

## Output Expectations

When implementing, report the user-facing changes, the design decisions that matter, files touched, and verification performed.

When reviewing, lead with concrete issues and file/line references. Prioritize broken flows, unusable controls, responsive failures, missing states, accessibility risks, and visual regressions.

## Boundaries

- Do not redesign unrelated areas.
- Do not introduce a design system or abstraction unless it removes real duplication or matches the repo's direction.
- Do not make a landing page when the user asked for an app, tool, dashboard, or game.
- Do not prioritize visual flourish over the user's core workflow.
- Do not invent product requirements that conflict with the user's brief or project docs.
