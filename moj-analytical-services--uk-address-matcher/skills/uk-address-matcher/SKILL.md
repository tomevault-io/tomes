# Benchmark Experiment Skill

Use this skill for recurring benchmark workflows in `uk_address_matcher`.

## Goal

- Resolve benchmark experiments, persisted comparisons, and record-level audits without rediscovering commands, env vars, or artefact paths across the repo.

## Success Criteria

- The correct benchmark workflow is chosen.
- Persisted artefacts are used before reruns where they already answer the question.
- Rebuilds and reruns only happen when there is a concrete evidence gap.
- Reports include run IDs, output paths, changed settings, PR-AUC / area-under-the-curve evidence, and validation evidence.

## Start Here

- Read `.github/instructions/benchmark-experiments.instructions.md` first.
- Then use the bundled assets in this skill instead of rediscovering commands across `benchmarking/`, `.github/prompts/`, and `docs/findings/`.

## What This Skill Covers

- Standard persisted benchmark runs via `benchmarking/run_benchmarking.py`
- Reduced canonical rebuilds via `scripts/reduced_canonical.py`
- Structural TF variant builds via `benchmarking/build_structural_tf_variant.py`
- Replay audits and row-level loser analysis
- Persisted artefact lookup under `benchmarking/results/<dataset>/<date>/<run_id>/`
- Static loser-viewer regeneration for findings work

## Bundled Assets

- `commands.md` for exact command templates
- `env-vars.md` for `UKAM_*` and dataset data-path variables
- `artefacts.md` for persisted-run directory contents and which files to read first

## Workflow Selection

- Use `benchmarking/run_benchmarking.py` for normal persisted experiments.
- Use `scripts/reduced_canonical.py` when upstream cleaned features or canonical-side fields changed and the standard reduced canonical needs rebuilding.
- Use `benchmarking/build_structural_tf_variant.py` when the task is a structural TF ablation or variant comparison.
- Use `benchmarking/structural_tf_recall_audit.py` when the user wants replayed threshold analysis or row-level lost-record exports.
- Use `benchmarking/structural_tf_loser_viewer.py` when the user wants a portable HTML review surface from lost-record JSON.

Start from persisted run artefacts whenever the request can be answered from existing outputs.

## Working Rules

- Prefer `uv run python -m ...` for benchmark entrypoints that rely on package imports.
- Prefer persisted artefacts over console summaries.
- Use PR-AUC / area under the precision-recall curve as a primary threshold-independent decision aid, not just fixed-threshold precision/recall.
- Treat the overlay precision-recall chart plus PR-AUC as the minimum pair for deciding whether a variant is broadly better.
- Report run IDs, output directories, exact changed settings, PR-AUC findings, and overlay chart paths.
- If a workflow question is already answered in this skill, do not reopen broad repo exploration.

## Stop Rules

- Do not rebuild reduced canonical data unless upstream cleaned features or canonical-side fields changed.
- Do not rerun a benchmark or replay audit just to restate numbers already available in persisted artefacts.
- When enough persisted evidence exists to answer correctly, answer and stop.
