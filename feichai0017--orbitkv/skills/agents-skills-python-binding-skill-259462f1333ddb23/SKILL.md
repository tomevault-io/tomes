# OrbitKV Python bindings and adapters

Read `AGENTS.md` from the Git root. Keep Python responsible for framework callbacks,
layout inspection, GPU allocations and ownership handoff; shared cache state
machines, batching, waiting and execution belong to the existing Rust owners.

- Public bindings: `python/src/lib.rs`, `python/src/client.rs` and
  `python/orbitkv/orbitkv.pyi`. Update stubs when an exposed API changes. Verify
  actual call sites rather than restoring removed aliases or client facades.
- Common client ownership: `crates/orbitkv-channel/src/cache_client.rs`.
- Engine callback changes: use `.agents/skills/engine-integration/SKILL.md` and
  `docs/adapters.md`; release targets and current qualification are distinct.
- Model/layout identity and hybrid recovery are shared contracts. Do not equate
  compatible API shapes with cross-engine byte compatibility.

Use the gate table in `AGENTS.md`: default Python tests must remain source-only;
native lifecycle changes need process integration, and consumed adapter changes
need the relevant engine correctness/restart gate. Run `benches/tests` when
changing benchmark helpers. Put runtime outputs outside the checkout.

Use `scripts/build-wheel.sh` for a complete installed artifact; `maturin develop`
is a development build. See `docs/releases.md` for CUDA variants, bundled native
dependencies and installed-package checks. Freeze native artifacts before GPU
tests: Cargo can restage shared libraries used by live Managers.
