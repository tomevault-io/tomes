# Higgsfield Soul ID — Character Consistency

## What Is Soul ID?

Soul ID is Higgsfield's character consistency system. Create a character reference once,
then reuse it across unlimited generations — different scenes, angles, lighting, and
actions — while the face and core appearance remain consistent.

---

## How It Works

1. **Create a Soul ID** — Upload a reference image or generate one using Soul 2.0
2. **The platform stores the character** — assigns it an ID
3. **Reference in future prompts** — "using Soul ID character [name/reference]"
4. **Character stays consistent** — face, skin tone, basic features carry across generations

---

## When to Use Soul ID

✅ You're building a multi-shot sequence with the same character
✅ You're creating a short film / story with a recurring protagonist
✅ You're making an AI influencer or brand mascot
✅ You want consistent faces across a product ad campaign
✅ You're doing a multi-scene action sequence and need the hero to look the same

❌ Don't use if you only need one shot — overkill for single generations
❌ Don't use if you want maximum creative variation — consistency limits style range

---

## Prompting With Soul ID

When a Soul ID character is active, your prompt should:

**1. Reference the character simply:**
```
The Soul ID character walks through a crowded Tokyo street at night.
```

**2. Describe what changes — not what the character looks like:**
```
The Soul ID character now wears a formal black suit. She stands at a podium,
addressing a conference room. Camera: Dolly In toward her face.
Style: Cinematic, cool corporate lighting, 16:9.
```

**3. You can change clothing, setting, expression:**
```
The Soul ID character is now in a red dress, dancing alone in a ballroom.
Camera: 360 Orbit.
Style: Cinematic, warm golden chandelier light.
```

**Key rule:** Don't re-describe the face or core features — the Soul ID handles that.
Only describe what is *different* from the base character.

---

## Identity vs. Motion Separation — Hard Rule

When Soul ID is active, **every prompt MUST be split into two blocks**. This is the
single most important rule for preventing identity drift.

### Identity Block — Static descriptors only
Contains: face features, clothing, body type, distinguishing marks, color palette.
Does NOT contain: any motion, camera, speed, or temporal language.

### Motion Block — Temporal and camera only
Contains: camera movement, action choreography, speed, environmental changes.
Does NOT contain: any character appearance repetition.

### Before/After Examples

**Example 1 — Action scene:**

❌ **Mixed (bad) — causes identity drift:**
```
A tall woman with green eyes and freckles in a leather jacket sprints through
a warehouse while the camera tracks her and her green eyes flash with determination
and her freckles catch the fluorescent light as she vaults over a railing.
```
Face morphs mid-clip because the model re-reads face descriptors while processing motion.

✅ **Separated (good) — identity stays locked:**

**Identity Block:**
```
The Soul ID character — tall build, green eyes, light freckles across the nose
and cheeks, wearing a fitted black leather jacket, dark jeans.
```

**Motion Block:**
```
She sprints through a dimly lit warehouse, vaults over a metal railing
without breaking stride.
Camera: Action Run — low behind her, matching pace.
Fluorescent lights flicker overhead.
Style: Cinematic, cold industrial blue, high contrast. 16:9.
```

---

**Example 2 — Emotional close-up:**

❌ **Mixed (bad) — face warps during camera move:**
```
A weathered man with deep wrinkles and sad brown eyes wearing a grey wool coat
sits on a park bench as the camera slowly dollies in on his wrinkled face and
sad brown eyes while autumn leaves drift past his grey coat.
```

✅ **Separated (good) — face stays sharp:**

**Identity Block:**
```
The Soul ID character — man in his 60s, deep wrinkles, warm brown eyes,
wearing a heavy grey wool coat, brown leather gloves.
```

**Motion Block:**
```
He sits on a park bench, hands folded in his lap, staring at the ground.
A single autumn leaf drifts into frame and lands on the bench beside him.
Camera: slow Dolly In toward his face.
Style: Cinematic. Overcast diffused light, muted earth tones. 16:9.
```

---

**Example 3 — Cinema Studio (@ Elements):**

❌ **Mixed (bad) — identity in the prompt field:**
```
@Sarah with her dark curly hair and tattoo sleeve walks into the bar.
```

✅ **Separated (good) — identity in the Element, motion in the prompt:**

**@ Element definition (set in Cinema Studio UI):**
```
@Sarah: dark curly hair, tattoo sleeve on left arm, wearing a vintage band tee.
```

**Prompt field:**
```
@Sarah pushes open the door and steps inside. She scans the room, then walks
to the far end of the bar. The bartender nods.
```

### Which descriptors belong where

| Identity Block | Motion Block |
|---------------|-------------|
| Face shape, skin tone, eye color | Camera movement name |
| Hair style, color, length | Action verbs (runs, turns, sits) |
| Body type, height, build | Environmental motion (wind, rain, lights) |
| Clothing, accessories, jewelry | Speed and timing cues |
| Scars, tattoos, distinguishing marks | Atmospheric changes (light shifts, fog) |
| Color palette of the character | Style and color grade of the scene |

## Creating a Strong Soul ID Reference

The quality of your Soul ID reference image determines consistency quality.

**For best results:**
- Use a **front-facing or 3/4 angle** portrait — full face visible
- **Even lighting** — avoid harsh shadows obscuring features
- **Neutral to slight expression** — smile is fine, extreme emotion limits flexibility
- **Clear image** — no blur, no obstruction, no glasses if avoidable
- **Solo subject** — no other people in the reference frame

**Image models to generate your Soul ID reference:**
- **Soul 2.0** — best for fashion-forward, high-aesthetic characters
- **Nano Banana Pro** — best for maximum photorealistic sharpness
- **Seedream 4.5** — good for a range of styles

---

## Character Sheet Creation

A **character sheet** is a multi-angle reference image showing the same character from
several viewpoints — typically front, 3/4, side profile, and back. It gives the model
comprehensive geometry to work from and dramatically improves consistency.

**How to create a character sheet:**
1. Generate your character in Cinema Studio using your preferred optical stack
2. Use **Grid Generation (2×2 or 4×4)** to produce multiple variations
3. Alternatively, use **3D Mode (Gaussian splatting)** to orbit a single generation and
   capture front, side, and 3/4 angles
4. Arrange the best angles into a single composite reference image
5. Upload as your Soul ID reference

**What to include on a character sheet:**
- **Front face** — neutral expression, even lighting
- **3/4 angle** — shows depth of facial features
- **Side profile** — nose, jaw, ear structure
- **Full body** (optional) — posture, costume, proportions

**Prompt pattern to generate character sheet content:**
```
Front-facing portrait of [character description], neutral expression, even studio lighting,
clean background. Head and shoulders visible.
```
Then use 3D Mode to orbit and capture additional angles from the same generation.

**Why it matters:** A multi-angle character sheet gives Soul ID far more geometry data
than a single photo. This translates directly into better consistency across extreme
angle changes, action shots, and profile views.

## Micro-Expressions — Nuanced Performance Direction

Use these facial performance directions to add emotional depth to Soul ID characters.
Combine with Soul Cast or character prompting for precise actor-level control.

### Core Set

| **Vulnerable Openness** | Soft eyes, slightly parted lips, unguarded | Romance, confession, emotional honesty |

---

## Multi-Character Consistency

If you need multiple consistent characters in the same scene:

```
Shot 1 — establish both:
The Soul ID character [Character A] and a second character [Character B, describe
appearance] face each other across a table. Camera: Arc slowly around them.

Shot 2 — reference both:
The Soul ID character [A] slides a folder across the table.
[Character B] opens it, expression shifting from confusion to realization.
Camera: Dolly In toward [B's] face.
```

Note: Higgsfield can hold multiple Soul IDs. Reference each clearly in the prompt.

---

## AI Influencer Workflow

Soul ID is the foundation of Higgsfield's AI Influencer Studio feature.

**Workflow:**
1. Create Soul ID from a high-quality portrait (generated or uploaded)
2. Generate images of the character in different outfits/settings
3. Animate using image-to-video with motion presets
4. Use Lipsync Studio to add speech if needed
5. Chain shots together for a full content series

**Prompt pattern for influencer content:**
```
The Soul ID character [name] is in a modern kitchen at golden hour.
She holds a coffee mug, steam rising. She looks directly at camera with a warm smile.
Camera: slight Dolly In. Style: Lifestyle, warm tones, 9:16 vertical.
```

### Character Consistency Best Practices

**Use 2–3 clear, well-lit reference shots:**
- Frontal view (primary identity anchor)
- 3/4-angle view (dimensional understanding)
- Side profile (silhouette + hair/ear/jawline)

**Outfit descriptions must be specific:**
- ~~"casual clothes"~~ → `fitted olive-green cotton t-shirt, dark indigo slim jeans, white leather sneakers with red accents`
- Include materials, colors, and distinctive details that the model can anchor to

**In I2V workflows — describe action, not appearance:**
The reference image already carries the character's visual identity. Re-describing their appearance creates conflict.

- **Wrong:** `@Image1 — A woman with curly brown hair and green eyes wearing a red jacket walks through the park.`
- **Right:** `@Image1 — She walks through the park, pausing to look up at the falling leaves. Camera: slow tracking alongside.`

**If features drift between shots:**
Use the character sheet image directly as @Image1 for tighter identity anchoring. A clean, well-lit character sheet outperforms multiple casual photos.

**Multi-character scenes:**
Reference each character separately with distinct @Image tags:

```
@Image1 as Character A (the detective). @Image2 as Character B (the witness).
Character A leans across the table, speaking firmly. Character B looks away, fidgeting.
Camera: slow push-in on Character B's face.
```

## Soul Cinema as the CS 3.0/3.5 Default Image Model

**Soul Cinema** is the default Cinematic model in the Cinema Studio 3.0 and 3.5 image-mode picker — the model that runs when you toggle Cinema Studio into image mode and do not change the model selection. It is shared across both Cinema Studio versions and is distinct from the older standalone "Soul Cinema Preview" model and from the separately-named Featured-list "Higgsfield Soul Cinema" (see `../higgsfield-cinema/SKILL.md` § Image Mode for the disambiguation).

### Soul ID identity prompting in Soul Cinema

When a Soul ID is active and Soul Cinema is the selected image model, the same **Identity vs. Motion separation** rule documented above applies — but Soul Cinema's general-purpose cinematic weighting means the Identity Block does most of the work and the "Motion Block" is replaced by a **Scene/Style Block** (since image generation has no temporal dimension).

**Identity Block** — Soul ID reference + static descriptors only:
```
The Soul ID character — [face/body/wardrobe descriptors only, no camera or motion language].
```

**Scene/Style Block** — environment + lighting + style direction:
```
[Setting], [time of day], [lighting quality], [color palette].
Style: Cinematic, [grade], [aspect ratio].
```

Keep the two blocks textually separate in the prompt. Do not re-describe identity inside the Scene/Style block — Soul Cinema is sensitive to identity drift if face/wardrobe descriptors leak into environmental phrasing. For broader picker context (when to pick Soul Cinema vs Cinematic Characters vs Cinematic Locations vs Cinematic Cameras), see `../higgsfield-cinema/SKILL.md` § Per-Cinematic-model selection guide.

### Studio Look vs. Cinematic Look — Soul Cinema as the Re-Pass

When a model returns a character that reads as **studio-feeling** — clean,
evenly lit, glossy, slightly plastic — the result is not a final. It's an
intermediate. The studio look is what the model defaults to when no atmosphere
or grade is doing work in the prompt; it's competently rendered but reads as
"AI-generated" rather than "filmed." (Distinct from **Cinema Studio**, the
product — here "studio" describes a visual quality of the output, not the
generation environment that produced it.) The fix is to treat the studio-feeling
output as a starting frame and re-pass it through Soul Cinema with explicit
cinematic direction — palette, grade, lens character, lighting language — until
the look lands.

These rules are adapted from the Mr. Core methodology.

**Diagnose the studio look.** Symptoms: skin reads as smooth/even rather than
specular; lighting feels evenly distributed (no key/fill ratio, no directional
shadow); palette is wide and accurate rather than graded; clothing fabric
reads as new and clean rather than worn or weighted; the frame as a whole
looks like a product photograph rather than a film still.

**The re-pass workflow.** Take the studio-feeling output and:

1. Use it as a reference upload into Soul Cinema (or use Edit Shot in Seedance
   if you want to preserve identity exactly and modify only the look).
2. Add an explicit grade direction — "Bleach Bypass," "Teal Orange Epic,"
   "Sodium Decay," "Bleached Warm" — pick from the Cinema Studio 3.5 Color
   Palette presets in `../higgsfield-cinema/SKILL.md` § Style Settings, or
   describe one in Manual Style.
3. Add directional lighting language — single key source, side rim, contre-jour,
   silhouette — not "well-lit" or "evenly lit."
4. Add lens character — Vintage Haze, Warm Halation, Anamorphic — to break the
   default clinical sharpness.
5. Add a palette compression — "muted," "desaturated," "crushed blacks" — to
   pull the wide accurate palette into a graded one.

The studio look is a stop on the path, not the destination. Plan for the
re-pass as part of the workflow; don't treat the first generation as the
final.
