# Higgsfield AI Prompt Skill

**Language rule:** Reply in whatever language the user writes in.

---

## MANDATORY WORKFLOW — do these in order, every time

For ANY Higgsfield-related request, follow this contract:

1. **Route the request.** Match the user's ask to the routing table in the "Route to the Right Skill" section below, and open the matching sub-skill file(s) with the read tool BEFORE writing any prompt or advice. Do not rely on prior knowledge — platform vocabulary, preset names, and model parameters must be read fresh from the skill files, because this platform's lineup changes between releases.
2. **Apply MCSLA** (Model · Camera · Subject · Look · Action) to every video prompt unless the user explicitly opts out. Full definition lives in `skills/higgsfield-prompt/SKILL.md`.
3. **Use named platform vocabulary only.** Camera names, motion presets, and style tokens must come from `vocab.md` or the relevant sub-skill. Do not invent terms the platform doesn't recognize — invented names silently degrade generations without warning.
4. **Append shared negative constraints** from `skills/shared/negative-constraints.md` before delivering any prompt.
5. **On the first Higgsfield response in a conversation**, state ONE short line naming which sub-skill you're routing to. Example: "Routing to higgsfield-prompt + higgsfield-camera for a cinematic chase." One line only, then proceed with the work.

## HARD RULES (do not skip under any circumstances)

- NEVER write a Higgsfield prompt without reading at least `skills/higgsfield-prompt/SKILL.md` first in the current conversation.
- NEVER substitute generic video-prompt vocabulary for named Higgsfield presets.
- NEVER skip MCSLA structure on video prompts.
- NEVER invent model versions, camera presets, or motion preset names. If the user names one you don't see in the skill files, say so and ask for clarification.
- If you find yourself thinking "I already know how to do this from training" — stop. Read the file. Your training data for this platform is stale.

## What Is Higgsfield?

Higgsfield is a cinematic AI video and image generation platform built for filmmakers and
creators. Unlike single-model tools, Higgsfield hosts **multiple generation engines** on one
platform — Kling 3.0/3.0 Omni/3.0 Motion Control, Sora 2, Google Veo 3.1/3.1 Lite, Wan 2.7/2.6/2.5,
Seedance 2.0/Pro, Minimax Hailuo 2.3/02, Higgsfield DoP (Lite/Standard/Turbo) for video; Soul 2.0, Soul Cinema Preview,
Soul Cast, Nano Banana Pro/2, Kling Image 3.0/Omni, Seedream 4.0, GPT Image 1.5,
Flux 2/Kontext for images — plus a library of 100+ named **Motion Presets**, a **Soul ID**
character consistency system, **Cinema Studio 2.5**, **Cinema Studio 3.0** (Business/Team plan), and **Cinema Studio 3.5** with Soul Cast AI actors, native dual-channel stereo audio, and 80+
one-click **Apps**.

## Workflow

### Fast Path — Simple Creative Requests

If the user provides a clear creative intent ("write me a prompt for a car chase at night")
with no specific constraints, **generate immediately** using these sensible defaults:

> **Fast Path still requires reading `skills/higgsfield-prompt/SKILL.md` first — Fast Path means skip clarifying questions, NOT skip the file read.**

| Parameter | Default |
|-----------|---------|
| Aspect ratio | 16:9 |
| Duration | 8s |
| Style | Cinematic |
| Video model | Kling 3.0 (character-focused) or Sora 2 (action/scale) |
| Image model | Soul 2.0 (portrait) or Nano Banana 2 (everything else) |

Do not ask clarifying questions. Deliver a ready-to-paste prompt. Mention the defaults
used so the user can adjust if they want something different.

> If you did not read `skills/higgsfield-prompt/SKILL.md` earlier in this conversation, read it now before writing the prompt.

### Full Path — Production Requests

When the user signals production-grade intent (Cinema Studio, multi-shot, specific model,
budget constraints, client work), **confirm before generating:**

**Required:**
- **Generation type**: Image / Video / App (one-click)
- **Video duration**: 5s / 10s (image-to-video clips are 3–5s; text-to-video up to 10s+)
- **Aspect ratio**: 16:9 / 9:16 / 1:1 / 4:5 / 4:3 / 2.35:1 (default: 16:9)
- **Model preference** (or ask Claude to recommend — see `skills/higgsfield-models/SKILL.md`)

**Optional (skip if user already provided):**
- Visual style: Cinematic / VHS / Super 8MM / Anamorphic / Abstract
- Soul ID character reference (if character consistency needed)
- Reference image for image-to-video
- Motion preset preference

> Ask everything in one message — do not split across multiple rounds.

### Check Templates for Genre Match

Before writing a prompt from scratch, check if the user's request matches a common genre
pattern. The `templates/` folder contains 10 annotated example templates with line-by-line
breakdowns, recommended models, negative constraints, and variations.

| User request matches | Check template |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Chase, pursuit, action, parkour | `templates/01-cinematic-action-chase.md` |
| Product, commercial, ad, UGC | `templates/02-product-ugc-showcase.md` |
| Horror, scary, creepy, dread | `templates/03-horror-atmosphere.md` |
| Fashion, editorial, lookbook | `templates/04-fashion-editorial.md` |
| Sci-fi, cyberpunk, VFX, space | `templates/05-sci-fi-vfx.md` |
| Portrait, character intro, close-up | `templates/06-portrait-character-intro.md` |
| Landscape, nature, establishing shot | `templates/07-landscape-establishing-shot.md` |
| Comedy, social media, TikTok, skit | `templates/08-comedy-social-media.md` |
| Romance, intimate, couple, wedding | `templates/09-romantic-intimate.md` |
| Dance, music, performance, concert | `templates/10-dance-music-performance.md` |

Use the template as a starting point — adapt the example prompt to the user's specific
request. The annotations explain WHY each element works, helping you make informed
substitutions.

### Build the Prompt Using the MCSLA Formula

Full MCSLA definition and prompt structure → `skills/higgsfield-prompt/SKILL.md`

Quick summary — five layers, every prompt:

| M | C | S | L | A |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Model | Camera | Subject | Look | Action |

**Core rules:**
- Be specific — name camera presets, describe VFX concretely
- Keep prompts under 200 words
- Subject → Action → Camera → Style is the most reliable order

---

### Output Format

**Single prompt:**
```
**Model**: [model name]
**Aspect ratio**: [ratio]  **Duration**: [Xs]  **Style**: [style]

[Prompt]

**Camera**: [camera control name]
**Motion preset** (if used): [preset name]
```

**Two versions (when style varies):**
```
### Version 1 — [Style Name]
[Prompt]

---
### Version 2 — [Style Name]
[Prompt]
```

**Output rules:**
- Output a clean, ready-to-paste prompt — no meta-commentary after
- Do not explain what every line does unless the user asks
- Always name the camera control and motion preset explicitly

---

## @ Reference Rules

- User uploads image: use `[reference image]` or describe it as "the provided reference"
- For Soul ID character: note "using Soul ID character reference" in the prompt
- For video extension: note "extend from [reference video], continue with..."
- For style transfer: note "match the visual style of [reference image]"

---

## Shared Resources

| Resource | What it contains | When to use |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| `skills/shared/negative-constraints.md` | All generation artifacts + prevention phrases, by category | Check before every prompt — append relevant constraints |
| `templates/` | 10 annotated genre templates with examples, models, annotations, variations | When user request matches a common genre — use as starting point |
