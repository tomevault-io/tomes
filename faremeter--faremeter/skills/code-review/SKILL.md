# Code Review

Use this skill when performing code reviews or pull request reviews.

## Scope Determination

Focus only on commits that are contained within the branch being reviewed.
Use `git diff <base-branch>...HEAD` to determine what is in scope.

```bash
# List commits on the branch
git log --oneline <base-branch>..HEAD

# Get the full diff for review
git diff <base-branch>...HEAD

# Get diff for a specific file
git diff <base-branch>...HEAD -- <file>
```

## Pre-existing Code

If a bug, convention violation, or inconsistent naming existed in code before
the branch, do not treat it as a problem in the review. This includes cases
where refactored code retains a pre-existing type name, variable name, or
pattern that does not match current conventions.

Only evaluate the changes introduced by the branch.

## Convention Compliance

All new logic, patterns, and naming introduced by the branch MUST follow the
conventions defined in `CONVENTIONS.md`. Pre-existing code that appears in
the diff due to refactoring is exempt from this requirement.

## Delegating to Sub-agents

When delegating file review to sub-agents, provide the output of
`git diff <base-branch>...HEAD -- <file>` rather than the full file contents.

Sub-agents that receive full files cannot distinguish branch changes from
pre-existing code and will flag out-of-scope issues.

If full files must be provided for context, explicitly instruct the sub-agent
which line ranges were modified by the branch and that only those ranges are
in scope.

## Test Coverage

Do not request additional test coverage for functionality provided by external
libraries. For example:

- Type validation handled by arktype does not need tests verifying that invalid
  types are rejected
- HTTP parsing handled by Hono does not need tests for malformed requests
- Cryptographic operations from viem or @solana/kit do not need correctness tests

Focus test coverage requests on:

- Business logic and domain-specific validation
- Integration points between components
- Error handling paths and edge cases
- Custom algorithms and data transformations

See the "Test Coverage Philosophy" section in `CONVENTIONS.md` for more details.

## Review Checklist

1. Determine the base branch (usually `main`)
2. Run `git log --oneline <base>..HEAD` to understand the scope
3. Run `git diff <base>...HEAD --stat` to see which files changed
4. Review each changed file, focusing only on lines modified by the branch
5. Check that new code follows `CONVENTIONS.md`
6. Verify the build passes with `make`
7. Summarize findings with specific file:line references
