description: Tuning LLM inference settings on hal0 / Strix Halo for throughput, latency, or memory. Use when asked to optimize/tune a model's llama.cpp flags & values (batch, ubatch, ngl, flash-attn, KV-cache quant, threads), find the fastest config, or close a gap vs other people's numbers. Combines benchmark-driven sweeps (via hal0-bench) with external research (r/LocalLLaMA, llama.cpp GitHub issues/PRs, the kyuz0 toolbox repo). Core rule: never apply a community claim without measuring it locally first. Use when this capability is needed.

Find the flags/values that maximize a target metric for a model on this box, by
**measuring**, not guessing. The measurement engine is the [`hal0-bench`](../hal0-bench/SKILL.md)
CLI; this skill is the method that drives it.

Pick **one** target up front — they trade off:
- **tg t/s** (decode speed) — memory-bandwidth bound on Strix Halo (unified LPDDR5X).
- **pp t/s** (prefill) — compute bound.
- **TTFT / latency**, or **memory footprint** (fit a bigger model / longer context).
- Always subject to a **quality floor** (a faster config that degrades output is a regression).

## The loop (RED→GREEN per change)

1. **Baseline.** Run the `lane-matrix` suite (or an ad-hoc one-model suite) —
   `hal0 bench run --suite lane-matrix`, or narrower per the Sweeping section below — then
   `hal0 bench results --model <id> --json`. Record current pp/tg per lane.
2. **Research** (below) → a short list of *candidate* flags/values with a hypothesis for *why*
   each should help on gfx1151. Don't apply anything yet.
3. **Sweep** each candidate against the baseline model + backend (one variable at a time, or a
   small grid). Measure.
4. **Keep winners, discard the rest.** A change that doesn't beat baseline ± noise is dropped.
5. **Iterate** on the new best; stop when gains fall below noise (~stddev) or you hit the memory wall.
6. **Quality-check** the winning config before recommending it (see Quality floor).
7. **Report** (and optionally apply to a slot).

## Sweeping (the workhorse)

There is no standalone `sweep` command any more — a flag-tuning sweep is a **suite**
whose `[matrix].configs` is a list of `{label, flags}` variants; every variant becomes
its own measured cell (`hal0.bench.suites.Matrix`). The shipped `lane-matrix` suite
(`/etc/hal0/bench/suites/lane-matrix.toml`) is the canonical tuning suite — both lanes
across the 2k/32k/128k depth axis on a small set of profile-class representative models.
For a narrower, model-specific sweep, write an ad-hoc suite TOML and point `hal0 bench
run` at its path:

```toml
# /tmp/tune-qwen.toml
[suite]
id = "tune-qwen"
exclusive = true

[selector]
include_only = true
include = ["qwen3.6-27b"]              # registry id, not the gguf path

[matrix]
lanes   = ["rocm", "vulkan_radv"]
depths  = [2048]
configs = [
  { label = "ub512",  flags = { "-ub" = "512" } },
  { label = "ub1024", flags = { "-ub" = "1024" } },
  { label = "ub2048", flags = { "-ub" = "2048" } },
  { label = "ub4096", flags = { "-ub" = "4096" } },
]

[cells]
kinds = ["pp", "tg"]

[staleness]
max_age_days = 0        # always (re)measure — this is a one-off tuning run
```

```bash
hal0 bench plan --suite /tmp/tune-qwen.toml         # sanity-check the worklist first
hal0 bench run  --suite /tmp/tune-qwen.toml
hal0 bench results --model qwen3.6-27b --json       # then compare configs
```

Allowed tuning flags (seam whitelist, enforced on the argv `hal0.bench.harness` composes
before the `hal0-benchctl` `exec` seam re-validates it): `-b -ub -ngl -fa -ctk -ctv -p -n
-d -r -t -mmp -pg`. Tuning needs a quiet GPU, so `exclusive = true` is normally required
— only when nothing is serving; the runner stops/restarts the slots around the suite (see
hal0-bench's GPU rule).

## What's worth tuning on Strix Halo (gfx1151, Radeon 8060S)

Priors from the production `hal0-slot@agent` config: `-b 8192 -ub 2048 -ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0
-fa on --no-mmap`, threads 16/32. Start near these.

| Flag | Effect | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `-ub` (ubatch) | biggest lever on both pp and tg | **optimum differs per backend** — ROCm likes large (2048+), Vulkan often smaller (512). Always sweep. |
| `-b` (batch) | prefill throughput | pair with ub; diminishing returns past 8192. |
| `-fa` (flash-attn) | speed + memory at depth | usually a win on; verify on this gfx — Vulkan FA support has changed across versions. |
| `-ctk`/`-ctv` (KV quant) | memory + bandwidth | `q8_0` ≈ big memory save, tiny quality cost; `f16` = baseline quality. Matters most at long context (decode is bandwidth bound). |
| `-t` (threads) | CPU-side work | sweep around physical cores (16); rarely the bottleneck for GPU offload. |
| `-ngl` | set per lane, not per sweep | 99 (full offload) on `rocm`/`vulkan_radv`, 0 on the `cpu` lane. Only pass your own to study the CPU/GPU split — llama-bench APPENDS it to the lane's value as a second sweep row rather than replacing it. |

Out of llama-bench scope (server-level, tune separately): **draft/MTP speculative decode**
(`--spec-draft-*`) and `--parallel`/slots — `installer/bench/server_ab.py` (Tier B) covers
that, talking to `hal0-api` + the slot port directly, no sudo.

## External research (then verify locally)

Surface ideas, **then prove them with a sweep** — hardware/driver/version specifics make
generic advice unreliable.

- **r/LocalLLaMA** — search: `Strix Halo`, `Ryzen AI Max 395`, `gfx1151`, `Radeon 8060S`,
  `ROCm vs Vulkan llama.cpp`, `unified memory GTT`. Good for real-world flag combos + gotchas.
- **llama.cpp GitHub** — issues/PRs/discussions for `ROCm`/`HIP`, `Vulkan`, `gfx1151`,
  `flash attention`, `KV cache quant`. PRs often reveal which backend just got faster and the
  exact flag that unlocks it.
- **kyuz0/amd-strix-halo-toolboxes** — issues + its `benchmark/` results; this is the same
  image lineage we run, so its findings transfer best.
- **ROCm release notes / AMD community** — for gfx1151 enablement and `HSA_OVERRIDE` quirks.

Use your web tools (or the deep-research skill). For each promising claim, write down the
**hypothesis + source**, then the **measured delta** on our model. Discard claims that don't
reproduce here.

## Quality floor (don't trade quality blindly)

Speed flags can hurt output — especially aggressive KV quant. Before recommending a config
that touches `-ctk/-ctv` (or anything beyond ub/b), validate quality, e.g. the existing
`/mnt/lab/qwen3coder-bench/` capability/eval runs on the tuned settings. Report speed **and**
quality; if quality drops, the config is not a win.

## Applying a winning config to a slot

Slot configs live in `/etc/hal0/slots/<slot>.toml` (`hal0:hal0` — agent-editable). To persist
tuned flags:

1. **Back up** the toml. Change **one** thing (the validated winner).
2. Reload via the hal0 CLI (`hal0 slot ...` — check `hal0 slot --help`; it regenerates the
   unit through the `hal0-slotctl` seam). Do **not** hand-edit `/etc/systemd/system/hal0-slot@*`
   (regenerated).
3. **Verify health** (`hal0 slot status`, the slot's `/health`) and confirm live tok/s improved.
4. Keep the rollback ready. This changes **production serving** — treat as Tier-2: only when
   safe, verify after, revert on regression.

## Output

A short tuning report: target metric, baseline vs best (pp/tg per backend), the winning flags
with the measured delta and the rationale/source for each, any quality check, and the exact
`hal0 slot` change to apply it. Raw evidence is in the v2 store (`hal0 bench results` /
`hal0 bench history`, backed by `records.jsonl` + `bench.db` under `/var/lib/hal0-bench/`).
