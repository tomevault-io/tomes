# TT-Studio

> TT-Studio is an easy-to-use web interface for running AI models on Tenstorrent hardware.
  It combines TT Inference Server's core packaging setup, containerization,
  and deployment automation with TT-Metal's model execution framework specifically optimized for Tenstorrent hardware.

Important notes:

- TT-Studio requires access to a Tenstorrent AI accelerator for full deployment features
- Alternatively, you can connect just the frontend to a remote API endpoint without direct hardware access
- The platform provides automatic hardware detection and seamless integration with Tenstorrent devices
- Uses containerized deployment through Docker for isolation and easy deployment
- The startup.sh script is deprecated - use `python run.py` for all operations

## Key Components

- **Frontend Interface**: Modern React-based UI for model interaction and management
- **Backend API**: Django-based service for model management, deployment, and API endpoints
- **TT Inference Server**: FastAPI server for handling model inference requests
- **Docker Containers**: Complete containerization for isolation and easy deployment
- **Automatic Hardware Detection**: Seamless integration and auto-mounting of Tenstorrent devices (/dev/tenstorrent)
- **Automated Setup**: Complete environment configuration and model setup automation via run.py script

## Supported AI Models

- **Chat-based Language Models (LLMs)**: Text generation and conversational AI
- **Computer Vision (YOLO)**: Object detection and image analysis
- **Speech Recognition (Whisper)**: Audio-to-text transcription
- **Image Generation (Stable Diffusion)**: AI-powered image creation
