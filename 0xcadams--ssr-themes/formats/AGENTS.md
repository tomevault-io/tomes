# AGENTS.md

## Scope

- Bun workspace for the `ssr-themes` library, the `landing/` app, and the `examples/` apps.
- Package manager is `bun@1.3.11`; runtime baseline is Node `>=20`.
- CI runs from the repo root and covers unit tests plus Playwright.
- GitHub Actions CI and release jobs run on Node `24`.

## Repo Map

- `ssr-themes/` - published library source, Vite library build, Vitest tests.
- `landing/` - TanStack Start marketing/docs site.
- `examples/next/` - Next.js App Router example used by Playwright.
- `examples/solid/` - SolidStart example.
- `examples/tanstack-start/` - TanStack Start example.
- `test/` - root Playwright specs.

## Repo-Specific Rules

- No existing root `AGENTS.md` was present when this file was created.
- No `.cursorrules`, no `.cursor/rules/`, and no `.github/copilot-instructions.md` were found.
- There are no extra Cursor or Copilot instruction files to merge beyond this document.

## Tooling Notes

- Run commands from the repo root unless a package-local run is clearer.
- Root scripts use Bun workspace filters; there is no Turbo/Nx layer.
- There is no ESLint, Biome, or Rome config today.
- Formatting is controlled by `.prettierrc`; standalone typecheck uses `tsc --noEmit`.
- npm publishing uses `.github/workflows/release.yml` with npm trusted publishing; keep that filename aligned with the npm trusted publisher config.

bun run test:e2e
# single unit test
bunx vitest run ssr-themes/tests/header.test.ts
bunx vitest run ssr-themes/tests/index.test.tsx -t "setSelected"
# single Playwright test

bunx playwright test test/system-theme.test.ts -g "should render dark theme if preferred-colorscheme is dark"
bunx playwright test --list test/system-theme.test.ts
```

- `bun run format` is the write-mode formatter command.
- `bun run check-format` is the repo's lint-equivalent formatting check.
- `bun run check-types` runs the repo's typecheck suite.
- `bun run test` mainly runs the library's Vitest suite.
- `bun run test:e2e` first builds `ssr-themes`, then runs Playwright.
- Playwright boots `@ssr-themes/next` on port `4041`.
- Use Vitest `-t` and Playwright `-g` to target a single test; use Playwright `--list` to inspect titles.

## Publishing

- Create releases from a tag that matches `ssr-themes/package.json` as `v<version>`, for example `gh release create v0.2.1 --target main --notes "..."`.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs on GitHub Release publish and optional manual dispatch; it checks the tag/version match before publishing.
- The release workflow installs with `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, runs unit tests, Prettier check, workspace type checks, Playwright, a full workspace build, dry-runs `npm pack`, and publishes from `ssr-themes/`.
- npm authentication is handled by trusted publishing with GitHub-hosted runners and `id-token: write`; no `NPM_TOKEN` should be added for normal releases.
- If the workflow filename, repository, or optional environment changes, update the npm trusted publisher settings to match exactly before the next release.

## Code Style

### Formatting

- Follow `.prettierrc`: single quotes, trailing commas, no bracket spacing, `arrowParens: avoid`, `quoteProps: consistent`.
- Prettier print width is `55`; aggressive wrapping is expected.
- Keep semicolons and let Prettier own line breaks.

### Imports

- Keep imports at the top of the file.
- Put external packages before internal alias or relative imports.
- Use `import type` or inline `type` specifiers for type-only imports.
- Use `import * as React from 'react'` when the file uses the `React.` namespace; otherwise named imports are fine.
- CSS side-effect imports usually come after value imports.
- Match the surrounding file's grouping style instead of imposing a new one.

### TypeScript

- Prefer explicit props and return types when they improve readability or public API safety.
- Avoid `any`; use generics, unions, `unknown`, `Partial<Record<...>>`, template literal types, `as const`, and `satisfies`.
- Preserve strong public typing in `ssr-themes/` exports.
- The library is not fully `strict`, but it still relies on `strictNullChecks`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, and `noImplicitReturns`.
- The landing app and examples are `strict: true`; do not weaken types there.

### Naming

- Components, exported types, and interfaces use `PascalCase`.
- Hooks and helpers use `camelCase`.
- Route modules export `Route` from `createFileRoute(...)` or `createRootRoute(...)`.
- Library filenames use kebab-case like `theme-script.ts` and `register-theme.ts`.
- Reserve `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for true shared constants; many normal constants stay `camelCase`.

### React / SSR / Theme Conventions

- Keep `'use client';` only in files that truly need client execution.
- For Next.js Server Components, import the provider from `ssr-themes/react` and shared SSR helpers from `ssr-themes`.
- If you customize `themes`, `attribute`, `valueMap`, or `cookie`, pass the same options to both `themeScript()` and `ThemeProvider`.
- If SSR output depends on the current theme, read cookies on the server and pass the value through `registerTheme(...)` and `initialTheme`.
- Keep theme changes hydration-safe and cookie-backed.

### Errors And Control Flow

- Prefer early returns and guard clauses.
- For malformed cookie values or missing browser state, return `undefined` or no-op instead of throwing.
- Use `try` / `catch` sparingly around browser APIs that may fail or be unavailable.
- Swallow errors only when failure is expected and harmless, such as clipboard or cookie persistence fallbacks.
- Use `catch {}` when the error object is intentionally unused.

### Tests

- Unit tests use Vitest; React tests use Testing Library and jsdom.
- E2E tests use Playwright from the repo root.
- Test files use `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`.
- Reuse helpers when building matrix-style coverage.
- Prefer `describe`, `test`, `it`, `renderHook`, `act`, and `screen` in the existing style.
- Keep `data-test-id` selectors stable when Playwright depends on them.
- If you change theme behavior, run both Vitest and Playwright.

### Styling

- Landing and example apps use Tailwind CSS v4 via `@import 'tailwindcss';`.
- Theme variants are driven by HTML classes and custom variants like `@custom-variant dark`.
- Shared UI components in `landing/` use `cva` plus the local `cn(...)` helper.
- Prefer CSS variables for theme tokens over duplicated literal colors.
- Preserve the current visual language instead of redesigning unrelated UI.

### Generated Files

- Do not hand-edit `landing/src/routeTree.gen.ts` or `examples/tanstack-start/src/routeTree.gen.ts`.
- Those files are generated by TanStack Router and marked as overwrite-only.
- Keep generated files out of manual lint/format churn when possible.

## Change Checklist

- Update docs or examples when public library API changes.
- Treat exported JSDoc/type hover docs as part of the public API. When exported behavior, overloads, or types change, update the canonical docs on the public signatures and interfaces, not just the implementation helpers.
- Keep `README.md` and landing snippets aligned with behavior changes.
- If you touch SSR or hydration behavior, verify the Next example path used by Playwright.
- Prefer minimal, targeted edits that match existing patterns.
