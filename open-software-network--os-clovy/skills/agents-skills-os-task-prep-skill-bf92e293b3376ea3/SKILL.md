# os-task-prep

Productizes the loop: **find open Issues -> diagnose against the code -> map
cross-Issue dependencies and blockers -> enrich the Issue on the platform ->
(optionally) assign -> emit `repo-build-pr` prompts** so autonomous ("AFK")
agents can pick them up with full context.

It composes two existing skills and adds the one capability they lack:

- **`os-platform`** (read-only + `issues take`): list/show Issues, and assign.
- **`repo-build-pr`**: the per-Issue implementation loop the emitted prompts
  target. Invoke it directly (`/repo-build-pr`); the old `/build` alias is
  deprecated -- do not emit it.
- **`scripts/enrich_issue.py`** (this skill): the only mutation `os-platform`
  does not provide -- `PATCH /v1/orgs/{org}/bounties/{number}` to append
  diagnosis notes to `body_markdown`, idempotently and append-only.

## Prerequisites

- `OS_PLATFORM_API_KEY` must be set in the environment (see the `os-platform`
  skill). Never ask the user to paste it into chat; never echo it.
- Run from a checkout of `open-software-network/os-clovy` so the diagnosis step
  can read the real code.
- The default org/project come from `os-platform.json` (`org`, `limit`).

## Workflow

### 1. Find ready-to-code Issues

Use the `os-platform` skill. Default to the narrowest actionable queue:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/os-platform/scripts/os_platform.py issues list <org> --status todo --limit 30
```

Pick candidates that are genuinely **ready to code**, not just `status: todo`:

- Prefer `creator.kind: "integration"` / well-specified reports with clear
  expected behavior over raw `creator.kind: "user"` reports that need triage.
- Prefer tight, self-contained scope. Flag overlap: Issues that touch the same
  large file (e.g. `AgentWorkspace.tsx`) will conflict if run in parallel
  worktrees -- note which to serialize.
- Skip design-only / question / vague Issues unless asked.
- Honor assignment hints: surface unassigned or already-yours first.

State how many you selected and why; `log` anything you dropped.

### 2. Diagnose each against the codebase (parallel, read-only)

Spawn one `Explore` subagent per Issue. Give each the Issue title + body and ask
for **Files (file:line), Root cause / site, Implementation sketch, Acceptance
criteria, Verify**. Demand real `file_path:line` references and an explicit
"evidence thin" note when unsure. These agents must not edit anything.

This diagnosis is what makes the Issue AFK-ready: a fresh agent that has never
seen the repo gets the root cause and the exact edit site for free.

### 3. Map dependencies and blockers (cross-Issue pass)

After diagnosing, look across the selected Issues -- not just within each one.
This is the difference between "five tickets" and "a plan": an agent that knows
it shares a file with another in-flight Issue can rebase deliberately instead of
producing a doomed parallel diff.

- **Shared-file conflicts.** Build a file-overlap matrix from the diagnoses.
  Issues that edit the same file (e.g. several touching `AgentWorkspace.tsx`)
  collide if run as parallel worktrees. Mark them to **serialize** and pick an
  order (smallest / most-foundational change first).
- **Logical dependencies.** Does one fix need another to land first -- a shared
  helper, a refactor that must precede the rest? Record `depends-on: JUN-XXX`.
- **External blockers.** Anything that stops an agent finishing autonomously: a
  needed design decision, a product question, an API/backend change, a missing
  fixture. Record `blocked-by: <what>` so it is not dispatched blind.

Carry these findings into both the enrichment (step 4) and the dispatch order
(step 6). When nothing applies, say so explicitly ("independent, parallel-safe").

### 4. Enrich the Issue description on the platform

For each Issue, distill the diagnosis into a markdown block beginning with the
marker line, then append it with the bundled script:

```bash
# notes.md starts with: ## Implementation notes (investigated by agent for @<handle>)
python3 .claude/skills/os-task-prep/scripts/enrich_issue.py \
  --org <org> --number <n> --notes-file notes.md
```

Rules baked into the script (do not work around them):

- **Append-only** under a `---` rule; the reporter's original text is preserved.
- **Idempotent**: re-runs skip if the marker is present. Use `--replace` to
  regenerate the section after a better diagnosis.
- Sets `User-Agent: os-platform-agent-skill/1.0` -- the default urllib UA is
  Cloudflare-blocked (HTTP 403, "error code: 1010").
- Verifies the marker is present after PATCH and reports the new length.

Include a **Dependencies / blockers** line carrying the step 3 findings, e.g.
`**Dependencies / blockers:** serialize with JUN-114/116/117 (shared
AgentWorkspace.tsx); depends-on: none; blocked-by: none.` Write
"none -- independent" when the Issue is genuinely standalone.

Keep notes tight and end with a drift caveat, e.g.
`_Investigated against os-clovy @ <sha>. Line refs may drift; confirm before editing._`

Use plain hyphens, not en/em dashes, per repo copy conventions.

### 5. Optionally assign to the current user

Only when the user asks ("assign me"). Use the `os-platform` skill -- it is the
blessed mutation path and also moves `todo -> in_progress`, which prevents a
teammate double-claiming an Issue an agent is about to work:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/os-platform/scripts/os_platform.py issues take <org> <n> --yes
```

`--yes` only when the user has already confirmed in chat. `issues take` refuses
non-`todo` Issues, so enrich first (enriching does not change status). Tell the
user assignment also flips status to `in_progress` and is reversible.

### 6. Emit the dispatch table

Output a table the user can copy, one row per Issue, carrying (a) the dispatch
**order / deps** from step 3 and (b) a one-line prompt that invokes the build
skill, references `os-platform` for Issue context, and states the root cause.
**Match the skill-trigger prefix to the runtime the agents run in:**

- Claude Code triggers skills with `/`:  `/repo-build-pr /os-platform JUN-113 ...`
- Codex CLI triggers skills with `$`:    `$repo-build-pr $os-platform JUN-113 ...`

The user dispatches AFK agents via Codex, so the `$` form is usually operative;
the Claude `/` form is the same line with the prefix swapped. Lead with the
parallel-safe rows; group serialized rows and number their order.

```
| Issue | Order / deps                                | Codex ($)                                                                 |
| ---   | ---                                         | ---                                                                       |
| JUN-114 | parallel-safe (CSS only)                  | $repo-build-pr $os-platform JUN-114 trim action-control padding to tokens |
| JUN-113 | serialize 1/3 -- shares AgentWorkspace.tsx | $repo-build-pr $os-platform JUN-113 onBranch ignores part.sessionId ...   |
```

Format: `<prefix>repo-build-pr <prefix>os-platform <ISSUE-ID> <one-line root cause / fix direction>`,
where `<prefix>` is `/` for Claude Code and `$` for Codex. The one-liner is the
single most useful sentence from the diagnosis -- the same sentence a reviewer
would want at the top of the PR. (`/build` is the deprecated alias for
`repo-build-pr`; never emit it.)

## Safety

- Enrichment mutates a shared production tracker. Append, never overwrite;
  confirm the PATCH path on one Issue before fanning out if unsure.
- Assignment is optional and user-gated.
- Do not print or persist `OS_PLATFORM_API_KEY`.
- The `enrich_issue.py` PATCH is intentionally the only write here beyond
  `os-platform`'s `issues take`. Do not add more mutations without being asked.
