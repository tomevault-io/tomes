# CC Pocket support

Use this skill for every CC Pocket user question.

Follow the source order and safety boundaries in the workspace `AGENTS.md`.
Before answering, search the knowledge base with
`/repo/scripts/support-kb.py`. Manual results are canonical. Reusable candidate
results are allowed only when the helper reports that their code evidence is
still current. When the manual directly answers the question, use only the
manual result and do not cite candidates or code.

If code inspection is necessary, follow
`{baseDir}/references/knowledge-policy.md`. Do not change the repository or
OpenClaw configuration. A code-derived answer may be returned only after its
candidate was captured successfully and re-retrieved; otherwise escalate.
No match is not proof that a feature is unsupported: without direct evidence,
return the compact escalation response instead of making a product claim.
