description: Run the UET test matrix across two suites and both address families on the two Linux VMs, or a selected subset. Suite "verbs" = ibv_ru_rma / ibv_ru_pingpong via the uet-verbs-test harness (rdma-core uprot provider): every feature axis (app-specified vs provider-assigned QPN, symmetric/asymmetric/absolute addressing, plain/derived/job/user-key MRs, address table, 64/32-bit keys, legacy vs builder ops, multi-SGE, 32/64-bit immediates). Suite "refprov" = ./scripts/uet_test.sh via the uet-test harness (uet-ref-prov standalone ./uet app): one cell per PDS/security mode (sng, pds, pds_direct, pds_cluster, pds_cluster_ssi, pds_server_ssi), each running all test types, shim=rawsock. Both suites sweep IPv4 (GID 1) and IPv6 link-local (GID 0), reporting per-cell PASS/FAIL and a final TOTAL. Use when the user wants to run the test matrix, the full compliance sweep, all the tests, IPv4+IPv6 coverage, the verbs and/or ref-prov suites; to list the available tests; to run one/some tests; or to dump the exact per-test command lines. IPv6 link-local peers are discovered dynamically from each VM's data-plane interface. Works from any clone/fork under /Volumes/work/sync/uec. Use when this capability is needed.

# uet-matrix

Run the UET test matrix on the two local Linux VMs, or just the cells the user
asks for, across **two suites** and **both address families**. This skill owns
the *catalog* of cells, the *suite* + *family* sweep, and the *selection*,
*list*, and *debug* modes; each cell is one call into the appropriate per-cell
harness (which does the build + client/server run).

## Suites

- **verbs** — `ibv_ru_rma` / `ibv_ru_pingpong` via the **uet-verbs-test** skill
  (rdma-core `uprot` provider). **21 cells** (`R01`–`R12` RMA, `P01`–`P09`
  pingpong) exercising every feature axis. Addressing: IPv4 = `-g 1`, IPv6
  link-local = `-g 0`; the client dials the server's link-local for v6.
- **refprov** — `./scripts/uet_test.sh` via the **uet-test** skill (the
  uet-ref-prov standalone `./uet` app). **6 cells**, one per PDS/security mode:
  `sng`, `pds`, `pds_direct`, `pds_cluster`, `pds_cluster_ssi`,
  `pds_server_ssi`. Each cell runs **all** test types (`test=all`) with
  `shim=rawsock`. Addressing is peer-to-peer (each side dials the other's
  data-plane address; link-local for v6).

A full sweep is **both suites × both families** = (21+6) × 2 = **54 cells**.

## Background

- **Family → GID index** (verbs suite, from the uprot kmod / `ibv_devinfo`):
  IPv4 = `-g 1`, IPv6 link-local = `-g 0`.
- **IPv6 peers are discovered at runtime** (nothing hardcoded): the script
  SSHes to each VM, finds the interface bound to the data-plane IPv4 subnet
  (`192.168.224.x`), and reads that interface's `scope link` IPv6. The verbs
  suite needs only the **server's** link-local; the refprov suite needs **both**
  VMs' link-locals (each side dials the other). If a needed link-local can't be
  discovered, the affected v6 cells are skipped with a warning.
- **PASS** = the harness prints `RESULT: PASS` (verbs: both client+server exit 0;
  refprov: client shows `--> Done!` and neither side shows `ERROR: Test failed!`).
- Only the **first cell of each suite** builds (default `--build clean`, a
  from-scratch build on both VMs, avoiding the stale-partial-build failure mode);
  later cells in that suite reuse the binaries.

## Running it

Invoke the helper directly and pass the user's arguments through:

```
~/.claude/skills/uet-matrix/run-uet-matrix.sh [options] [TEST ...]
```

A full sweep is long-running (two clean builds + 54 client/server runs; the
refprov TSS cells are especially slow). Prefer running it in the **background**
and monitoring `/tmp/uet_matrix/summary.txt` for per-cell `-> RESULT:` lines and
the final `TOTAL:` line, rather than blocking. Per-cell logs are written to
`/tmp/uet_matrix/NNN-<label>.log`.

## Arguments

- `--suite verbs|refprov|both` / `-s` — which suite(s) to run (default `both`).
- `--family v4|v6|both` / `-f` — which address family(ies) (default `both`).
- `--list` / `-l` — print the catalog (both suites, grouped) and exit.
- `--debug` / `-d` — for the selected tests, print **the exact command lines** as
  **markdown** (a `##` section per cell with fenced `sh` blocks) and run nothing:
  the harness invocation (cut/paste to re-run that cell) **and** the real per-VM
  `ssh …` server/client commands (from each harness's own `--dry-run`, so they
  can't drift). Diagnostics go to stderr, so stdout is clean markdown — render it
  or redirect to a `.md` file.
- `--build clean|make|none` / `-b` — build mode for the **first cell of each
  suite** (later cells in that suite reuse the binaries). Default `clean`. `make`
  = fast incremental; `none` = skip building.
- `--iters N` / `-n` — verbs iterations per test (default 10).
- `--timeout S` / `-t` — verbs per-side hard cap seconds (default 90). Each
  refprov cell runs `test=all` and uses its own longer cap
  (`$UET_RP_TIMEOUT`, default 900).
- `TEST …` — run only matching cells. A `TEST` matches a cell's **base label**
  (`R01`, `pds_direct`), its **family:label** (`v6:R01`), a **family** (`v6`), or
  a **suite** (`verbs`, `refprov`). Quoted **globs** work: `'R*'`, `'pds_*'`,
  `'v6:*'`. With no `TEST`, every cell in the selected suite(s)/family(ies) runs.

## Examples

```
# full sweep: both suites, v4 + v6 — run in background, watch summary.txt
run-uet-matrix.sh

run-uet-matrix.sh --list              # what tests exist (both suites)
run-uet-matrix.sh -s refprov          # just the ref-prov suite (v4 + v6)
run-uet-matrix.sh -s verbs -f v6 R11  # one verbs cell, IPv6
run-uet-matrix.sh pds_server_ssi      # the TSS server-mode ref-prov cell (both fams)
run-uet-matrix.sh -f v4 'P0*'         # all IPv4 verbs pingpong cells
run-uet-matrix.sh -d -s refprov       # print ref-prov commands, run nothing
run-uet-matrix.sh -b make R03         # incremental build, run one cell
```

## Config (env overrides)

- `UET_RDMA_HARNESS` / `UET_REFPROV_HARNESS` — paths to the verbs / refprov
  harnesses (default the sibling skills `uet-verbs-test` / `uet-test`).
- `UET_REMOTE_DIR` / `UET_REFPROV_DIR` — remote repo dirs on the VMs (rdma-core
  `wt_uet` / ref-prov `wt_pds`).
- `UET_SERVER_SSH` / `UET_CLIENT_SSH` — the two VM ssh targets (for v6 discovery
  and, for refprov, peer addressing).
- `UET_DP_SUBNET` — data-plane IPv4 subnet used to locate the interface.
- `UET_SHIM` — refprov NIC shim (default `rawsock`).
- `UET_IFNAME` — refprov interface name on the VMs (default `enp10s0`).
- `UET_RP_TIMEOUT` — refprov per-cell cap seconds (default 900).
- `UET_MATRIX_OUT` — output dir for logs/summary (default `/tmp/uet_matrix`).
