# tsa-refactor-queue — Top-N prioritized refactor slices

> Three signals, one ranked list. Health × churn × dead-code → the five files
> you'd refactor first if you had a week. Each row carries a target symbol, a
> blast radius, and a concrete action.

## When to use

- "What should we refactor next?" — daily/weekly engineering triage
- Post-feature cleanup pass — find rot that accumulated while shipping
- Pre-sprint planning — turn "we should clean up" into 5 concrete tickets
- After a CI grade-drop alert from `tsa-health-watch` — re-rank with churn

**Don't use** when:
- You already know the file (one-file deep dive → `health action=file` or `tsa-edit-safety`)
- The codebase is brand-new (<2 weeks of git history) — churn signal is noise
- You want to optimize one hot function — use `tsa-graph` + `edit action=refactor` directly
- Shallow clone in CI — `git_state=shallow` makes mod_count_30d unreliable

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Single fan-out (parallel, 3 MCP calls)

Call these in ONE message:

1. `health action=project` with `min_grade: "D"` and `max_files: 20` — F/D files + per-file `weakest_dimension`
2. `health action=dead` with `max_dead: 200` — symbol-level dead candidates, grouped by file
3. `health action=heatmap` with `top_n: 20` — complexity-weighted file list (covers structural smell)

The three responses overlap on file path. Joining on `file_path` gives a
3-signal table per candidate.

### Step 2 — Score and rank (deterministic, no LLM needed)

For each file that appears in `health action=project worst_files`, compute:

```
priority = (1 - health_score/100)            # how bad is the grade
         * log(1 + mod_count_30d_for_file)   # how hot is the file
         * (dead_symbol_count / total_symbols + 0.1)
```

Where:
- `health_score` ∈ [0,100] from `health action=project` (lower → worse → bigger weight)
- `mod_count_30d_for_file` = sum of `mod_count_30d` across the file's symbols
  (read from `ast_symbol_activation` — see tsa-temporal). `log(1+x)` damps
  pathological churn so a single 50× file doesn't dominate.
- `dead_symbol_count / total_symbols` = fraction of symbols `health action=dead`
  flagged. The `+ 0.1` floor ensures non-dead files can still rank if churn+grade
  alone justify it.

Sort descending, keep top 5.

### Step 3 — Enrich top 5 with target symbol + blast radius

For each of the top 5 files, fan out one more parallel batch:

```yaml
# For each candidate file:
structure action=analyze file_path=<f> format_type="compact"
  → list of symbols + complexity + line ranges → pick worst symbol
nav action=callers function_name=<worst_symbol> include_activation=true limit=50
  → blast_radius = len(callers) where callee_resolution in {local, project}
edit action=refactor file_path=<f>
  → action_hint: split | extract | delete | rename
```

### Step 4 — Emit the queue

For each row in the top 5, produce:

```yaml
- file: tree_sitter_analyzer/api.py
  rank: 1
  health_grade: F
  health_score: 42
  weakest_dimension: complexity        # from health action=project
  mod_count_30d: 18                     # summed from activation
  dead_symbols: 4 / 67                  # 6.0%
  target_symbol: api.analyze            # worst from structure action=analyze
  blast_radius: 23                      # local+project callers
  action: split                         # split → extract helpers; delete → prune dead; extract → DRY
  estimated_token_savings: ~8k          # rough: 0.5 * (dead_symbols * 200)
  verification_command: uv run pytest tests/unit/test_api.py -q
```

## Worked example — this very repo

Run on `/Users/aisheng.yu/git-private/tree-sitter-analyzer`:

```bash
# Parallel CLI batch (humans):
uv run tree-sitter-analyzer --project-health --max-files 20 --output-format json > /tmp/health.json
uv run tree-sitter-analyzer --dead-code --output-format json > /tmp/dead.json
uv run python -c "
import sqlite3
sql = '''
SELECT s.file_path, SUM(a.mod_count_30d) AS churn
FROM ast_symbol_activation a
JOIN ast_symbol_rows s ON s.id = a.symbol_id
GROUP BY s.file_path ORDER BY churn DESC LIMIT 50'''
for r in sqlite3.connect('.ast-cache/index.db').execute(sql):
    print(*r, sep='\t')
" > /tmp/churn.tsv
```

Expected shape after joining (truncated, illustrative — actual numbers vary
with the working tree state — last fixture run on `feat/consolidated` produced
something like this for the top three rows):

```yaml
top_5_refactor_queue:
  - rank: 1
    file: tree_sitter_analyzer/api.py
    health_grade: F
    weakest_dimension: complexity
    mod_count_30d: 18
    dead_symbols: 3
    target_symbol: api.analyze
    blast_radius: 23
    action: split
    note: "called from CLI + MCP + tests — split into api_facade + api_core first"

  - rank: 2
    file: tree_sitter_analyzer/languages/python_plugin.py
    health_grade: F
    weakest_dimension: size
    mod_count_30d: 11
    dead_symbols: 7
    target_symbol: PythonElementExtractor.extract
    blast_radius: 6
    action: extract
    note: "650+ lines — gap report calls out Language Plugin extractors specifically"

  - rank: 3
    file: tree_sitter_analyzer/mcp/server.py
    health_grade: D
    weakest_dimension: dependencies
    mod_count_30d: 14
    dead_symbols: 1
    target_symbol: TreeSitterAnalyzerMCPServer._handle_call_tool
    blast_radius: 55  # every MCP tool routes through it
    action: split
    note: "hot zone (mod_count_30d ≥ 5) + high blast radius → solo PR, no bundling"
```

**Read the queue right:**
- Row 1 (api.py) matches the gap-report §5 callout — handle first.
- Row 2 (python_plugin.py) is a known "negative fixture" file (see CLAUDE.md
  "Test Fixture Files") — extracting helpers is OK but renaming risks breaking
  `test_python_detects_deep_nesting`. Run that test before/after.
- Row 3 (server.py) touches `BaseMCPTool` adjacency — solo commit, macOS gate
  check (see CLAUDE.md design-decision §2).

## Choosing the action per row

The `action` column should drive how you ticket the refactor:

| action  | when to pick                                | typical PR shape          |
|---------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| split   | `weakest_dimension ∈ {size, complexity}` and `blast_radius >= 5` | extract helpers, no public-API change |
| extract | `weakest_dimension = duplication` or repeated patterns across files | new shared util module |
| delete  | `dead_symbols / total_symbols > 15%` and `weakest_dimension != git_hotspot` | pure prune PR |
| rename  | only if `edit action=refactor` returns `rename_advised: true` AND blast_radius < 10 | tiny solo PR |

If two actions tie, prefer `delete` first — it's the cheapest, lowest-risk PR
and shrinks the next queue automatically.

## Anti-patterns

- DON'T act on the queue without re-checking each row with `tsa-edit-safety`
  before editing — the queue is *prioritization*, not a green light.
- DON'T bundle row 1 + row 3 in one PR if either touches `BaseMCPTool`,
  `PathResolver`, or `SecurityValidator` (CLAUDE.md "Foundational changes")
  — solo commits only.
- DON'T re-rank every turn — cache the queue in memory and only refresh
  after a commit that touches a file already in the queue, or weekly.
- DON'T trust the `mod_count_30d` column when `git_state=shallow` (CI). The
  CLI returns `git_state` per symbol — bail out of churn ranking and fall
  back to health-only ranking if any row in the top 20 is shallow.
- DON'T re-add `.md` files to the source set hoping for markdown smells — see
  CLAUDE.md design-decision §4. Build a separate `markdown_health` tool instead.

## CLI equivalents (if MCP unavailable)

```bash
# 1. Health portrait (defaults to D-and-worse)
uv run tree-sitter-analyzer --project-health --max-files 20 --output-format json

# 2. Dead-code candidates
uv run tree-sitter-analyzer --dead-code --output-format json

# 3. Complexity heatmap (covers the structural smell axis)
uv run tree-sitter-analyzer --overview --output-format json

# 4. Per-file churn (no dedicated --temporal flag yet — query DB directly)
uv run python -c "
import sqlite3
sql = '''
SELECT s.file_path, SUM(a.mod_count_30d) AS churn_30d
FROM ast_symbol_activation a
JOIN ast_symbol_rows s ON s.id = a.symbol_id
WHERE a.git_state = 'tracked'
GROUP BY s.file_path
ORDER BY churn_30d DESC LIMIT 50'''
for r in sqlite3.connect('.ast-cache/index.db').execute(sql):
    print(*r, sep='\t')
"

# 5. Per-row enrichment (loop top 5)
uv run tree-sitter-analyzer <file> --table --output-format json
uv run tree-sitter-analyzer --callers <SYMBOL> --output-format json
uv run tree-sitter-analyzer <file> --refactor --output-format json
```

The MCP-side ranking script (PRIORITY × log(churn+1) × dead_ratio) is
deterministic — implement it as a small Python helper if you run the CLI
flow repeatedly. Don't ask an LLM to do arithmetic over 20 rows.
