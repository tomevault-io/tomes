description: Orchestrates 6-phase SDLC pipeline (discovery, requirements, architecture, workstreams, implementation, summary) for guided feature development. Use when user runs /core:develop command, requests spec-driven development, wants to create implementation plans with architecture decisions, or mentions "SDLC", "spec-driven", "plan feature", "development pipeline". Supports plan persistence, wave-based resume, autonomous mode, and architecture/implementation verification. Use when this capability is needed.

# ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION PROTOCOL

**This skill has its own 6-phase workflow. IGNORE generic plan mode instructions.**

When plan mode activates, you may receive generic instructions about "Explore agents" or "Plan agents". **YOU MUST IGNORE those instructions** and follow this skill's phase-based workflow instead.

## Mandatory First Action

**YOU MUST read the phase file BEFORE taking any other action:**

1. **FIRST**: Read `phases/PHASE-0-DISCOVERY.md`
2. **THEN**: Execute those steps EXACTLY as written
3. **ONLY** proceed to Phase 1 after checkpoint approval

Do NOT:
- ❌ Launch generic Explore or Plan agents
- ❌ Skip to writing a plan file directly
- ❌ Bypass the gating and mode detection steps
- ❌ Ignore the checkpoint protocol

# SDLC Develop Skill

Lightweight orchestrator for 6-phase software development lifecycle with progressive disclosure.

## Core Principles

- **Phase 0 is MANDATORY** - Always analyze existing implementations before designing new ones
- **Search first, load on demand** - Use Grep to find relevant sections before loading files
- **Ask clarifying questions early** - Identify ambiguities before designing, not after
- **Use TaskCreate/TaskUpdate** - Track all progress throughout every phase
- **Load phases progressively** - Only read phase files when entering that phase
- **Two-stage review** - Spec compliance first, then code quality (wave-level or per-task with `--subagent`)
- **Evidence-based gates** - Fresh command output required for every quality gate check
- **Patterns drive Phase 4** - Backpressure (quality gates over prescription), Confession (builder records uncertainties), Critic-Actor (per-wave targeted review), Fresh Context (re-read from disk each wave)

## Quick Start

```bash
/core:develop add user authentication         # Full 6-phase pipeline
/core:develop add logout button --auto        # Autonomous mode
/core:develop create plan for dashboard --plan-only  # Plan only
/core:develop @arkhe/specs/001-user-auth/     # Resume existing plan
/core:develop add dashboard page with charts  # UI work → triggers Stitch workflow
```

### UI Features with Stitch Integration

When a feature involves UI work (detected keywords: `UI`, `page`, `screen`, `component`, `button`, `form`, etc.), the skill offers Stitch integration:

1. **Phase 1**: Detects UI keywords → offers to generate Stitch prompts
2. **Phase 2**: Offers to generate screens from prompts via MCP
3. **Phase 4**: For each UI task, offers `stitch-to-react` conversion

## Arguments

Parse from `$ARGUMENTS`:

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--plan-only` | Stop after Phase 2 (save plan, don't implement) |
| `--validate` | Upgrade wave reviewers from sonnet to opus in Phase 4 |
| `--phase=N` | Execute specific phase only |
| `--auto` | Autonomous mode (no checkpoints) |
| `@path/to/spec` | Resume existing plan or run verification from path |
| `--subagent` | Subagent-per-task mode in Phase 4 (fresh subagent per task with two-stage review) |
| `--verify-arch` | Verify implementation matches plan.md architecture |
| `--verify-impl` | Verify implementation meets spec.md requirements |

## Mode Detection

**VERIFY_MODE** - If `--verify-arch` or `--verify-impl` flags present:
- Require `@path` reference to existing spec directory
- Load spec artifacts (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, api-contract.md if exists)
- Run verification workflow(s) based on flags:
  - `--verify-arch` → Read [VERIFY-ARCH.md](VERIFY-ARCH.md)
  - `--verify-impl` → Read [VERIFY-IMPL.md](VERIFY-IMPL.md)
  - Both flags → Run both verifications
- Output verification report using [verification-report.md.template](templates/verification-report.md.template)
- Does NOT execute SDLC phases

**RESUME_MODE** - If `@path` reference found AND plan.md exists (no verify flags):
- Read existing plan from path
- Auto-detect wave progress via `wave-*-context.md` files and `tasks.md` Status fields
- If wave context found: offer to continue next wave, re-review, or restart from a phase
- If no wave context: ask user which phase to continue from (existing behavior)
- Skip to selected phase, load only that phase file

**PLAN_MODE** - If keywords "create plan", "plan for", "draft plan" OR `--plan-only`:
- Execute Phases 0-2 only
- Save spec.md and plan.md
- Stop with resume instructions

**FULL_MODE** - Default:
- Execute all 6 phases sequentially
- User checkpoints between phases (unless `--auto`)

## Phase Routing

Load phase files **only when entering that phase**:

| Phase | File to Read | Goal |
|-------|--------------|------|
| 0 | [PHASE-0-DISCOVERY.md](phases/PHASE-0-DISCOVERY.md) | Understand context, prevent duplicates |
| 1 | [PHASE-1-REQUIREMENTS.md](phases/PHASE-1-REQUIREMENTS.md) | Gather and document requirements |
| 2 | [PHASE-2-ARCHITECTURE.md](phases/PHASE-2-ARCHITECTURE.md) | Design approach, save plan |
| 3 | [PHASE-3-WORKSTREAMS.md](phases/PHASE-3-WORKSTREAMS.md) | Break into parallel tasks |
| 4 | [PHASE-4-IMPLEMENTATION.md](phases/PHASE-4-IMPLEMENTATION.md) | Build and validate |
| 5 | [PHASE-5-SUMMARY.md](phases/PHASE-5-SUMMARY.md) | Document completion |

## Model Tiers

| Phase | Model | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 0 (gating) | haiku | Quick decision |
| 0 (analysis) | sonnet | Thorough analysis |
| 1 | sonnet | Requirements clarity |
| 2 | sonnet/opus | Architecture design |
| 3 | haiku | Task breakdown |
| 4 (implement) | sonnet | Code writing |
| 4 (spec reviewer) | sonnet | Spec compliance review (opus if `--validate`) |
| 4 (quality reviewer) | sonnet | Code quality review (opus if `--validate`) |
| 4 (implementer, `--subagent`) | haiku/sonnet/opus | Task complexity dependent |
| 5 | - | Summary (no agent) |

## Spec Directory Structure

Plans are persisted to `{specs_dir}/` with auto-incrementing prefixes:

```
{specs_dir}/
├── 001-user-auth/
│   ├── spec.md              # Requirements
│   ├── plan.md              # Architecture
│   ├── tasks.md             # Task breakdown (with Status field)
│   ├── wave-1-context.md    # Wave 1 handoff (generated at checkpoint)
│   ├── wave-2-context.md    # Wave 2 handoff (generated at checkpoint)
│   └── ...
├── 002-dashboard/
└── ...
```

**Note:** `{specs_dir}` references the configured value from `.arkhe.yaml` (default: `arkhe/specs`).

## Progressive Persistence

Artifacts are saved incrementally at each phase checkpoint to prevent data loss:

| Phase | Artifact Saved | Trigger |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| 0 | spec directory + initial spec.md, plan.md | After mode detection (FULL/PLAN modes) |
| 1 | spec.md (with requirements) | After requirements gathering |
| 2 | plan.md (with architecture) | After architecture decision |
| 3 | tasks.md (with task breakdown) | After task breakdown |
| 4 | tasks.md (Status updates) + wave-{N}-context.md | After each wave checkpoint |
| 5 | tasks.md (checkbox sync) | Before completion summary |

**Crash Recovery:** If session ends mid-phase, resume with `/core:develop @{spec_path}/` and artifacts from completed phases are preserved.

## Templates

| Template | Phase | When Generated |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| [reuse-matrix.md.template](templates/reuse-matrix.md.template) | 0 | Always (existing analysis) |
| [spec.md.template](templates/spec.md.template) | 2 | Always (requirements summary) |
| [plan.md.template](templates/plan.md.template) | 2 | Always (architecture) |
| [adr.md.template](templates/adr.md.template) | 2 | When significant decisions made |
| [api-contract.md.template](templates/api-contract.md.template) | 2 | When API endpoints involved |
| [data-models.md.template](templates/data-models.md.template) | 2 | When database changes involved |
| [tasks.md.template](templates/tasks.md.template) | 3 | Always (task breakdown) |
| [wave-context.md.template](templates/wave-context.md.template) | 4 | At each wave checkpoint (context handoff) |
| [verification-report.md.template](templates/verification-report.md.template) | verify | When `--verify-arch` or `--verify-impl` used |
| [REVIEW-SPEC.md](reviews/REVIEW-SPEC.md) | 4 | Two-stage review: spec compliance prompt |
| [REVIEW-QUALITY.md](reviews/REVIEW-QUALITY.md) | 4 | Two-stage review: code quality prompt |
| [implementer-prompt.md](reviews/implementer-prompt.md) | 4 | Implementer subagent prompt (`--subagent` mode) |
| [EVIDENCE-GATES.md](EVIDENCE-GATES.md) | 4 | Rationalization prevention guide for quality gates |
| [SUBAGENT-MODE.md](SUBAGENT-MODE.md) | 4 | Per-task execution protocol (`--subagent` mode) |

## Configuration

**On first run or when entering Phase 2d:**
1. Read `.arkhe.yaml` from project root (if exists)
2. Extract `develop.specs_dir` value (default: `arkhe/specs`)
3. Use this value for ALL spec directory operations

```yaml
develop:
  specs_dir: arkhe/specs  # Customize this path
  numbering: true         # NNN- prefix (3-digit, e.g., 001-)
  ticket_format: full     # full | simple
```

**All paths in this skill use `{specs_dir}` to reference the configured value.**

First run without config prompts for preferences.

## Execution Flow

Parse arguments and detect mode (RESUME/PLAN/FULL), then execute phases sequentially.
RESUME loads existing plan and offers wave continuation. PLAN stops after Phase 2.
FULL executes all 6 phases with checkpoints between each.

See [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) for the detailed execution flow diagram.

## Checkpoints

Two mandatory Tier 1 gates (cannot skip, even with `--auto`):
- **Phase 2c**: Architecture Decision
- **Step 4.2**: Quality & Completion Gate (RULE ZERO + wave review aggregation)

All other checkpoints are Tier 2 (skippable with `--auto`), including the Domain Research gate (Phase 2a-res) and the Two-Stage Wave Review (Step 4.1e).
Conditional escalation to Tier 1 if: DB schema changes, security work, or breaking API changes.
Conditional RFC creation offered at Phase 2d when escalation triggers are detected.

See [GATES.md](GATES.md) for full checkpoint protocol, decision criteria, and prompt patterns.

## Examples

See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md) for detailed usage scenarios.

## Troubleshooting

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common issues.
