# Plugin Release Checker

Pre-release content quality gate that complements `scripts/release.sh`. Run before generating the changelog or triggering the release workflow.

## Quick Start

Run the validation script to check all plugins:

```bash
scripts/check_release_readiness.py --all
```

Check a specific plugin:

```bash
scripts/check_release_readiness.py --plugin core
```

## Release Workflow Integration

```
/plugin-release-checker   ← THIS: validates plugin content quality
    ↓ (all checks pass)
/changelog                ← generates CHANGELOG entry
    ↓
./scripts/release.sh X.Y.Z  ← handles git tag + GitHub Release
```

## Checks Performed

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Skill Validation** | Run skill-validator across all skills in each plugin |
| **Marketplace Sync** | Verify all plugins in `plugins/` have entries in marketplace.json |
| **Version Consistency** | Check plugin.json versions match CHANGELOG entries |
| **Cross-References** | Detect broken links in SKILL.md → WORKFLOW.md, EXAMPLES.md, etc. |
| **Required Files** | Ensure each plugin has plugin.json and README.md |
| **Frontmatter** | Validate YAML frontmatter in agents, commands, and skills |
