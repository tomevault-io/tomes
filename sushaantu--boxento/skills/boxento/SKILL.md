# Commit

## Goals

- Produce a commit that reflects the actual code changes and the session context.
- Follow common git conventions with a concise subject and wrapped body.
- Include both summary and rationale in the body.

## Inputs

- Codex session history for intent and rationale.
- `git status`, `git diff`, and `git diff --staged` for actual changes.
- Repo-specific commit conventions if documented.

## Steps

1. Read session history to identify scope, intent, and rationale.
2. Inspect the working tree and staged changes.
3. Stage intended changes, including new files, after confirming scope.
4. Sanity-check newly added files and flag anything that looks like an artifact, log, or temp file.
5. If staging is incomplete or includes unrelated files, fix the index or ask for confirmation.
6. Choose a conventional type and optional scope that match the change.
7. Write a subject line in imperative mood, 72 characters or fewer, without a trailing period.
8. Write a body that includes:
   - Summary of key changes.
   - Rationale and trade-offs.
   - Tests or validation run, or an explicit note if not run.
9. Append a `Co-authored-by` trailer for Codex using `Codex <codex@openai.com>` unless the user explicitly requests a different identity.
10. Wrap body lines at 72 characters.
11. Create the commit with `git commit -F <file>` or equivalent so newlines are literal.
12. Ensure the message matches the staged changes before committing.

## Template

```text
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

Summary:
- <what changed>
- <what changed>

Rationale:
- <why>
- <why>

Tests:
- <command or "not run (reason)">

Co-authored-by: Codex <codex@openai.com>
```
