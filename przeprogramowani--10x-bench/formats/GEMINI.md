# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**10xBench** is a comprehensive benchmark comparing how different large language models handle "vibe coding"—creating a fully functional website for [Przeprogramowani.pl](https://przeprogramowani.pl) in a single attempt without iterative refinement.

Each of four models (Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.3-Codex, Kimi K2.5, GLM-4.7) receives the same prompt and must generate a complete website implementation. Results are systematically evaluated against defined criteria and presented in an interactive dashboard.

## Quick Start Commands

### Development & Building

```bash
# Process results CSV files and generate results.json
npm run process-results

# Start development server (Astro) with results processing
npm run dev

# Build production site
npm run build

# Development from website directory (for Astro only)
cd website && npm run dev
cd website && npm run build
```

### Evaluation

```bash
# Run the evaluation skill to assess an implementation
/10x-score-attempts against <attempt-directory>

# Example:
/10x-score-attempts against claude opus attempt 1
```

## Project Structure

### Core Directories

- **`./scripts/`** — Data processing utilities
  - `process-results.ts` — TypeScript script that parses CSV evaluation files from each attempt and generates `results.json`

- **`./website/`** — Astro-based results dashboard
  - `src/pages/index.astro` — Main results overview page
  - `src/pages/benchmark.astro` — Benchmark prompt and criteria page
  - `src/components/ResultCard.tsx` — Summary cards showing attempt scores
  - `src/components/ResultsTable.tsx` — Interactive comparison table with sticky headers
  - `src/components/ModelAveragesCard.tsx` — Model family average summaries
  - `src/data/results.json` — Generated data file (created by `process-results.ts`)

- **`./eval-attempts/`** — Model implementations (one-shot attempts)
  - `claude-opus-attempt-{1,2,3}/` — Claude Opus 4.6 implementations
  - `gpt-codex-attempt-{1,2,3}/` — GPT-5.3-Codex implementations
  - `kimi-k2.5-attempt-{1,2,3}/` — Kimi K2.5 implementations
  - `glm-4.7-attempt-{1,2,3}/` — GLM-4.7 implementations
  - Each contains `eval-result.csv` with criterion-by-criterion scores

- **`./eval-results/`** — Processed evaluation results
  - Contains `eval-result.csv` files from each attempt (symlinks to source)

> **Note:** Evaluation criteria and scoring methodology live in the companion repo [10x-bench-eval](https://github.com/przeprogramowani/10x-bench-eval).

## Data Processing Pipeline

The `scripts/process-results.ts` script orchestrates the results workflow:

1. **Discovers** all eval-attempts directories
2. **Parses** `eval-result.csv` from each attempt
3. **Extracts** model name and attempt number from directory name
4. **Calculates** total scores and percentages (excluding "Task completion time")
5. **Aggregates** averages by model family
6. **Generates** `website/src/data/results.json`

### CSV Format Support

The script handles two CSV formats:

- **New format** (glm-4.7, gpt-codex): `Criterion,Score,Max,Notes`
- **Legacy format** (some attempts): `Criterion,Score,Notes` (assumes Max=1)

Both are parsed correctly and normalized to the same structure.

### Task Completion Time Format

The "Task completion time" row in eval-results CSV must use the standardized format `Xmin Ys` (e.g. `5min 46s`, `17min 3s`). Use `N/A` when time was not recorded. The format must be consistent in both the Score and Notes columns:

```csv
Task completion time,5min 46s,N/A,5min 46s
Task completion time,N/A,N/A,N/A
```

The `ResultsTable.tsx` component relies on this exact format to parse and display times.

### Test Run Format

The "Test run" row records when the evaluation was performed. It uses the format `D.MM.YYYY HH:MM` in both the Score and Notes columns, with `N/A` for Max:

```csv
Test run,9.02.2026 19:20,N/A,9.02.2026 19:20
```

Use `N/A` in Score and Notes when the test run date/time was not recorded. Every eval-results CSV should include this row immediately after "Task completion time".

## Results Dashboard (Astro Site)

### Pages

**`/` (Results Overview)**
- Displays all attempts sorted by percentage (best to worst)
- ResultCard components show summary stats with progress bars
- Color-coded scores: red (0-33%), yellow (33-66%), green (66%+)
- ModelAveragesCard shows family averages at the bottom

**`/benchmark`**
- Full-width display of the benchmark prompt (`benchmark/prompt.md`)
- Full-width display of evaluation criteria (`benchmark/criteria.md`)
- Both rendered as HTML from markdown

### Interactive Features

- **ResultsTable** (on index page)
  - Sticky header for scrolling context
  - Frozen first column (criterion names) for horizontal scrolling
  - Clickable notes that expand inline
  - Responsive design for mobile

- **Progress bars** in ResultCard components color-coded by performance tier

## Technology Stack

### Website (Astro Framework)

- **Astro 5.x** — Static site generator
- **React 19** — UI components (ResultCard, ResultsTable, ModelAveragesCard)
- **Tailwind CSS 3.x** — Styling (v4 incompatible in this environment)
- **Marked** — Markdown to HTML conversion
- **TypeScript** — Type safety

### Build Tools

- **tsx** — TypeScript executor for scripts
- **TypeScript 5.3+** — Language

### Configuration

- `astro.config.mjs` — Astro configuration with React and Tailwind integrations
- `tailwind.config.mjs` — Tailwind CSS configuration
- `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript configuration
- `postcss.config.mjs` — PostCSS configuration for Tailwind

## Key Implementation Details

### Model Name Extraction

Directory names follow the pattern: `{model-id}-attempt-{number}`
- `claude-opus-attempt-1` → Claude Opus 4.6, Attempt 1
- `gpt-codex-attempt-2` → GPT-5.3-Codex, Attempt 2
- `kimi-k2.5-attempt-3` → Kimi K2.5, Attempt 3
- `glm-4.7-attempt-1` → GLM-4.7, Attempt 1

Model ID to display name mapping is defined in `scripts/process-results.ts`.

### Score Calculation

Total score = sum of all criterion scores (excluding "Task completion time")
Percentage = (total score / max possible score) × 100

The script handles variable max scores per criterion and computes accurate percentages.

### Layout Strategy

- Benchmark page: Sequential full-width sections (prompt, then criteria)
- Results overview: Full-width stacked containers sorted by performance
- Table: Sticky header with frozen first column for better UX

## File Paths for Common Tasks

| Task | File |
|------|------|
| Add/modify result cards | `./website/src/components/ResultCard.tsx` |
| Change table layout | `./website/src/components/ResultsTable.tsx` |
| Update home page | `./website/src/pages/index.astro` |
| Update benchmark page | `./website/src/pages/benchmark.astro` |
| Regenerate results data | `npm run process-results` |

## Adding New Model Attempts

1. Create new attempt directory: `./eval-attempts/{model-id}-attempt-{number}/`
2. Add `eval-result.csv` with evaluation results
3. Run `npm run process-results` to regenerate `results.json`
4. Dashboard will automatically include the new attempt

## Important Notes

- **Static output**: The Astro site is configured as `output: 'static'` (pre-renders all pages)
- **Data-driven**: Dashboard content is entirely driven by `results.json` generated from CSV files
- **No dependencies on eval-attempts at runtime**: Evaluation results are processed during build time
- **Tailwind v3 required**: v4 is not compatible in this environment; stick with Tailwind v3.4
- **File path traversal in Astro**: Use `fileURLToPath` + `dirname` when accessing files relative to Astro pages
- **Markdown rendering**: Uses `marked` library; ensure proper HTML escaping for user-provided content

## Building the website

You are absolutely NOT ALLOWED to read other attempts of models during the process of building the website. You are only focused on the task given by the user. If there's such attempt, use AskUserQuestion tool for permission to proceed.
