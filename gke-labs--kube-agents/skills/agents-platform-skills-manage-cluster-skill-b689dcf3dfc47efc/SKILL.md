# Manage Cluster Skill

When a user asks you to **manage** (onboard / start watching) a specific existing GKE cluster — e.g. _"manage my cluster `payments-prod` in `us-central1`"_ — bring it under management by creating its **Cluster Agent profile**. After this, the cluster gets a per-cluster agent and is delegable via the kanban board.

This is the explicit, user-driven counterpart to onboarding-time creation (`gke-cluster-creation`). It is safe to run repeatedly (idempotent).

## Steps

1. **Gather the target.** You need `project`, `cluster`, and `location`.
   - Use any values the user gave. If the user omits the **project**, resolve it:
     - default to the platform's active project: `gcloud config get-value project`; then
     - confirm the cluster exists in that project (next step). If it isn't there, or the name is ambiguous, run `gcloud container clusters list --format="value(name,location,resourceLabels)"` (optionally `--project <p>`) to locate it, and ask the user only if still ambiguous.

2. **Verify the cluster exists** before creating a profile (clean error instead of a half-scaffold):
   - `verify_gke_cluster` (platform GKE tool) or `gcloud container clusters describe <cluster> --location <location> --project <project> --format="value(status)"`.
   - If it does not exist, tell the user and stop.

3. **Create the profile:**

   ```bash
   python3 /opt/data/scripts/cluster_agent_profile.py create \
     --project "<project>" --cluster "<cluster>" --location "<location>"
   ```

   This scaffolds the Cluster Agent profile home on the data PVC, pins a read-only `KUBECONFIG` to that cluster, stamps its `cluster_identity` into the profile config, and prints the profile name. It is idempotent — re-managing an already-managed cluster is a safe no-op.

4. **Confirm to the user.** Report that `<cluster>` (`<project>/<location>`) is now managed: it has a Cluster Agent and is delegable (kanban).

> This step gives the cluster an agent **immediately**. Even without it, the `cluster-agent-reconcile` cron automatically gives every cluster in the project — including the management cluster where kube-agents runs — an agent on its next run; this skill just does it now.

## Stop managing

Because reconciliation manages **all** project clusters, deleting a still-existing cluster's profile alone won't stick — the next reconcile recreates it. To stop managing a cluster:

- **Tear down the cluster** (see `gke-cluster-creation`); reconcile prunes its profile automatically.
- Or **exclude it**: add its name to the `cluster-agent-reconcile` cron's `RECONCILE_EXCLUDE`, then delete the profile with `cluster_agent_profile.py delete --project … --cluster … --location …`.

## Notes

- Requires the cluster to be reachable by the platform's credentials (the create step runs `gcloud container clusters get-credentials`). If that fails, surface the error — the user may need to grant access.
- The Cluster Agent is **read-only**; managing a cluster does not grant any mutation ability. Remediation still flows through the Platform Agent's GitOps write path.
