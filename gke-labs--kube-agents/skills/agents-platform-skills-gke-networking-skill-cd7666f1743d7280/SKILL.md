# GKE Networking

This reference covers networking configuration for GKE clusters. The golden path
enforces private, VPC-native clusters with Dataplane V2.

## Private Cluster Access Patterns

The golden path creates a private cluster. Users access it via:

1.  **DNS endpoint (default)**: `allowExternalTraffic: true` enables access via
    the cluster's DNS endpoint from outside the VPC. No VPN required.
2.  **Private endpoint**: Direct access from within the VPC or via Cloud
    VPN/Interconnect.
3.  **Authorized networks**: Add specific CIDRs to
    `masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig` for IP-based access control.

```bash
# Access private cluster via DNS endpoint (golden path default)
gcloud container clusters get-credentials {cluster_name} \
  --region {region} --dns-endpoint \
  --quiet

# Access via private endpoint (from within VPC)
gcloud container clusters get-credentials {cluster_name} \
  --region {region} --internal-ip \
  --quiet
```

## Bring-Your-Own VPC/Subnet

If the customer has existing network infrastructure:

```bash
gcloud container clusters create-auto {cluster_name} \
  --region {region} \
  --network {vpc_name} \
  --subnetwork {subnet_name} \
  --cluster-secondary-range-name {pod_range} \
  --services-secondary-range-name {svc_range} \
  --enable-private-nodes \
  --enable-master-authorized-networks \
  --quiet
```

> **Day-0 Warning**: VPC, subnet, and IP ranges cannot be changed after cluster
> creation.

## VPC-Native Mode Benefits

VPC-native clusters route traffic natively using GCP Alias IP ranges. Key
benefits to cover:

1.  **Scalability**: Traffic routes natively inside the VPC, bypassing the need
    for custom routes and avoiding custom route limit bottlenecks.
2.  **Direct VPC Integration**: Direct resource integration across GCP networks
    without complex bridging or routing tunnels.
3.  **Avoiding IP Exhaustion**: Supports discontiguous IP ranges and optimizes
    allocation, reducing the risk of exhausting subnet IP ranges.

## IP Planning

| Resource      | Golden Path  | Notes                                      |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Pod CIDR      | `/17` (auto) | ~32K pod IPs; size based on maxPodsPerNode |
| Service CIDR  | `/20` (auto) | ~4K service IPs                            |
| Node subnet   | auto-created | /20 recommended for growth                 |
| Max pods/node | 48           | Each node gets a /25 pod range; set to 110 |
:               :              : for /24 per node                           :

**Pod CIDR sizing rule of thumb:**

-   `maxPodsPerNode=48` -> each node uses a `/25` (128 IPs) from pod CIDR
-   `maxPodsPerNode=110` -> each node uses a `/24` (256 IPs) from pod CIDR
-   Larger maxPodsPerNode = fewer nodes fit in a given CIDR

## Egress

-   Default: nodes use Cloud NAT for outbound internet access (private nodes
    have no public IPs) to allow private nodes to reach the internet without
    public IP exposure.
-   For static egress IPs: configure Cloud NAT with manual IP allocation to
    maintain a consistent source IP for external allowlists or partner
    firewalls.
-   For restricted egress: route through a firewall appliance via custom routes
    to inspect and filter outbound traffic according to organization security
    policies.

## Network Policy

Dataplane V2 (golden path) provides built-in Network Policy enforcement — no
additional addon needed. Apply default-deny per namespace, then allow specific
flows.

> See the `gke-workload-security` skill for default-deny policy and the
> `gke-multitenancy` skill for per-team allow policies.

## Before you pass `--dns-endpoint`

The `get-credentials --dns-endpoint` example above works only on a cluster that publishes a DNS
endpoint **and** has `controlPlaneEndpointsConfig.dnsEndpointConfig.allowExternalTraffic` set to
true. Check first:

```bash
gcloud container clusters describe {cluster_name} --region {region} \
  --format='value(controlPlaneEndpointsConfig.dnsEndpointConfig.endpoint,controlPlaneEndpointsConfig.dnsEndpointConfig.allowExternalTraffic)'
```

Do not infer support from the command succeeding. When external traffic is disabled, a caller that
Google treats as internal gets a warning rather than an error, plus a kubeconfig pointing at the
DNS endpoint that then returns HTTP 403 on first use — a failure that surfaces one step later than
its cause. `gcloud container clusters update {cluster_name} --enable-dns-access` turns the
setting on.

The Platform Agent's own tooling makes this decision per cluster in
`/opt/data/scripts/gke_endpoint.py`, so `switch_kube_context` and the Cluster Agent profile
scaffolding already pass the flag exactly when it applies; the check above is for the times you
run `get-credentials` by hand. That decision is re-read about once a minute per cluster, so after
enabling the setting, wait a moment before retrying rather than concluding it did not work.
