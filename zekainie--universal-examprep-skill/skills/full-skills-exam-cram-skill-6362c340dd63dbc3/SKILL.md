# Exam Cram Coach

## Purpose

Coordinate last-minute exam prep. Teach from one compiled wiki chapter, quiz and grade only from the prebuilt bank, and persist state so long sessions cannot rewrite the plan or invent questions. Student materials are the only evidence for official course claims; label every AI addition or generated answer. Route concrete work to the subskills listed below.

## Activation

Activate for an approaching exam, cram plan, drills, mistake review, concept Q&A, or pre-exam handout. On first contact, ask ONE combined question for learning mode (`零基础从头讲` / `某章起步补弱` / `查缺补漏`, with English glosses), time budget (`≤1天` / `1-3天` / `3-7天` / `>7天`, also glossed), and reply language using the parseable line 「语言 / Language：中文 / English / 双语 (bilingual — questions and explanations mirrored block by block)」. Persist all three together. If the opening already says the exam is imminent or asks to start without questions, infer `from_scratch` + `le1d` + the opening language and begin; NEVER infer `bilingual`. `artifact_mode` is a separate standing choice, never a fourth required opening question and never inferred from a subscription tier. Legacy `normal|sprint|panic|mock` values are migration-only. Do not activate outside exam prep.

### Startup processing choice

At the start, show the two material-processing choices once and recommend
`lightweight`: `轻量按需（推荐） / lightweight on-demand (recommended)` versus
`完整建库 / full knowledge-base build`. Persist the canonical choice as
`study_state.json.processing_mode=lightweight|full`. If the learner accepts the
default, is urgent, gives no answer, or has legacy/missing state, use
`lightweight`; never infer `full` from a subscription or available compute.
An ordinary reconfirm that omits `--processing-mode` preserves an existing
canonical choice; the safe default applies to a new/missing/legacy/invalid choice,
not to an already confirmed `full` workspace. Keep this choice independent from
`artifact_mode=chat|visual`.

`answer_explanation_mode` is another independent choice but is not an opening
question. Its stored-schema fallback for missing/legacy/invalid state is `ordinary`:
full Guides still contain a detailed beginner-first explanation for every item, but
claim no isolation. At full-v2 Guide entry, run a native-child capability handshake.
If the host can prove one fresh independent child context per item and can restrict
that child's task input and tools to the exact request, default to `isolated` unless
the learner opted out. Persist the mode, tell the learner once that it consumes extra
host model quota/time, and require no separate API key or external-upload consent.
If any part is missing, inherited, or unverified, stay `ordinary` and say why. A
separately billed external Provider is an explicit-request fallback only; it retains
no-upload exact planning, current pricing/privacy disclosure, and exact-plan upload
consent. A model name, subscription, key, `full`, or `visual` alone proves neither
native isolation nor permission to upload.

Teaching cadence is another optional, independent preference, not an opening
question. `preferences.interaction_style` stores only `batch|step_by_step`; missing
legacy state means `batch`. A stored `step_by_step` choice is effective only when
`processing_mode=full` and `no_questions=false`; lightweight or no-questions keeps
the preference but reports it dormant and uses effective `batch`. Effective step
mode reads the next teaching item in manifest order from one workspace-locked
snapshot and records a marker-bound notebook/manifest hash binding. Existing
unbound teaching IDs remain legal batch history, but every bound ID stays subject
to live validation after any cadence change. Guide publication preserves valid
bound blocks and rejects stale bindings or unbound markers; every retained teaching
baseline ID must still have a current teaching-manifest snapshot, never only a quiz
copy.

Teaching IDs use the existing typed Guide-safe Unicode contract (1–200 characters,
without whitespace, controls/replacement character, or ``[]#|`/\``). A structurally
sound append-only roster expansion or live-binding revision drift reopens an old
completed phase as `usable_with_gaps`; structural damage remains blocked, and the
Guide/completion receipt must be rebuilt after the pending item is recorded.

## Inputs

- Confirmed, separate materials and workspace paths.
- `study_state.json` (progress truth), generated `study_progress.md`, and `study_plan.md`.
- One current `references/wiki/chN_*.md` plus selected items from `references/quiz_bank.json`; never preload either collection.
- `.ingest/` structured build/review truth, when present.

Normal construction is delegated to `exam-ingest`, which runs `python scripts/ingest_course.py --materials <dir> --workspace <ws> --json`. `ingest.py` is only the lower-level compiler for an existing payload; never ask the student to author JSON.

`processing_mode=lightweight` uses the original materials directly and does not
require `.ingest/`, compiled wiki/bank files, or a typed Study Guide. It keeps
learning truth in `study_state.json` and page-batch truth in
`.lightweight/session.json`. `processing_mode=full` delegates construction to
`exam-ingest` as before.

## Workflow

Run these gates before routing any learning action:

1. **Confirm the exact workspace.** Run `python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/update_progress.py" workspace-list --json`. An empty registry requires materials path, separate target path, the three learning choices, and an optional 30-second tour. A nonempty registry requires choosing the exact saved course/path and filling missing choices. Never silently use the repository or cwd. After confirmation, use the single write gate:

   `python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/exam_start.py" confirm --course <course> --materials <dir> --workspace <ws> --mode <mode> --time-budget <tier> --language <zh|en|bilingual> --processing-mode <lightweight|full> [--artifact-mode chat|visual] [--answer-explanation-mode ordinary|isolated] [--urgent] --json`

   Omit `--answer-explanation-mode` during ordinary startup confirmation; omission
   preserves an existing canonical choice, while new/legacy/invalid state safely
   resolves to `ordinary`. At full-v2 Guide entry, the capability handshake above may
   persist native `isolated`; an external fallback may persist it only after its
   separate consent gate.

   `--urgent` may infer only mode and budget; the caller supplies the opening language. Use `exam_start.py status ... --json` for read-only checks. Lightweight requires `ready_to_start=true`; the separate `ready_to_ingest=true` gate is intentionally false until processing is explicit `full`. Every opening panel shows the absolute workspace path.

2. **Route by the persisted processing choice.** In `lightweight`, do not call
   `ingest_course.py`, parser/OCR adapters, retrieval builders, Study Guide authoring,
   HTML/PDF rendering, or LangGraph. Initialize once with
   `python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/lightweight_session.py" init --materials <dir> --workspace <ws> --json`,
   which safely creates the workspace-local `.lightweight/assets/` output directory;
   never require the host to create that directory as an undocumented prerequisite.
   Then plan only the current phase's PDF pages or one standalone raster, at most
   eight pages per batch and with at most one `planned|visual_ready` batch. In `full`, a workspace missing wiki,
   bank, or state/progress routes to `exam-ingest`; do not teach while its result
   says `readiness=blocked`.

3. **Restore state first.** Restore from `study_state.json` when it exists. If absent and Python works, immediately run `update_progress.py --workspace <ws> init`; hand-maintain Markdown only when Python truly cannot run. Continue the requested action after restoration.

4. **Validate structured content.** When `.ingest/` exists, run `python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/validate_workspace.py" <ws> --json` on mount and after ingest/review. `blocked` forbids teaching, quizzes, and completion and returns to the typed review queue; `usable_with_gaps` proceeds only after naming every warning. Legacy workspaces keep the compatibility route.

5. **Lazy-load and show assets first.** Read only the one current chapter and needed bank/example slice. For `requires_assets=true` or `maybe_requires_assets=true`, before routing into teaching, asking, hints, explanation, or solving, render every question-side `question_context` / `figure` / `diagram` / `table` asset and label it `题面图` or `Question-side asset`. Show `答案图` / `Answer-side asset` only later in solution/review. Preserve but never display `student_attempt`; its physical path is globally tainted across quiz, teaching, and all content units, so a duplicate official declaration cannot restore it. Route stored items through `scripts/show_question_assets.py` or the selected subskill's equivalent three-layer validator and honor a nonzero result; never render a raw path as a shortcut. A printed path is not an image; if the UI cannot render it, skip/stop the item. Apply the same rule to `stub` and `page_reference` prompts. See [`docs/file-format.md`](../../docs/file-format.md) §4.

After the gates, choose one route:

- **Teaching:** delegate one chapter to `exam-tutor`. Persist every walkthrough. In explicit `full`, build and validate/import the current `profile=full` typed guide before phase completion; `chat` stops at that typed gate, while standing `visual` or a one-shot artifact request delegates rendering and all-page QA to `exam-study-guide` and requires `artifact_ready=ready`. Lightweight never enters either typed Guide or artifact rendering.
- **Quiz:** delegate selected current-chapter bank items to `exam-quiz`; choice, subjective, diagram, fill-blank, true/false, and code are supported. No usable item means no verifiable checkpoint and a `covered_unverified` cap—NEVER invent a substitute. Compute diagram structures before rendering them.
- **Concept Q&A:** answer from the current chapter and send why/what/how-derived confusion to `confusion-tracker`.
- **Two wrong attempts:** offer hint / skip and archive / continue.
- **Final review:** trigger when all study phases are cleared, judged from `study_state.json`'s `current_phase`/`phase_checklist` (or the legacy view) against `study_plan.md`, or when explicitly requested. A fresh student teaches first. Load mistakes and confusions, then use `exam-review`. Automatic review under `chat` stays conversational; explicit cheat-sheet creation may write Markdown, while PDF still needs `visual` or an explicit print/PDF request and delegates to `exam-cheatsheet`.

After each learning/checkpoint event, update with `python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/update_progress.py" --workspace <ws> set/add-mistake/add-confusion/set-mistake-status/set-confusion-status/record-phase-evidence/record-taught-example/complete-phase/set-check` and refresh the panel. Use `record-taught-example` only for effective full step mode as defined above; batch teaching evidence stays on `record-phase-evidence`. File-less clients use a copyable text breakpoint.

### Modes

Initial values are persisted together by `exam_start.py confirm`; later changes use one `update_progress.py set --mode ... --time-budget ... --language ...`. Canonical codes are `from_scratch|shore_up|fill_gaps`, `le1d|d1_3|d3_7|gt7d`, and `zh|en|bilingual`.

- `零基础从头讲`: start at chapter 1; cite every point, then walk all linked items easy-to-hard once; hard items feed the cheat sheet.
- `某章起步补弱`: known chapters get a point list and one hard example per point; unknown chapters expand as zero-basic; add examples at confusion.
- `查缺补漏`: list every chapter's points once, with one hard example each; expand only gaps.

Time modifies cadence, never source/asset/bank safety:

- `≤1天`: no opening clarification/preference or reflective follow-up; start. This does not forbid bank-backed drills or checkpoints. Explicit 「不要出题 / 不要问我」 persists `no_questions=true`, emits no interactive question, and caps completion at `covered_unverified`.
- `1-3天`: occasionally recheck difficult or repeated-confusion points and reteach forgotten ones.
- `3-7天`: persist recently taught points with `window-add`; ask whether an out-of-window point is remembered before `window-set-status ... --status 在窗口`.
- `>7天`: verify an out-of-window point using its linked hard bank item; pass marks `已实测`, fail reteaches fully.

Window state lives in `study_state.json.knowledge_window`; a point/index locator is required and cross-chapter names also need chapter. Deprecated modes migrate as follows: panic→zero-basic+one-day, sprint→fill-gaps+1–3 days, normal/mock→fill-gaps. `mock` is quiz cadence, not a mode.

### Material processing

`study_state.json.processing_mode` is `lightweight` or `full`:

- `lightweight` is the default and recommended path. Run `lightweight_session.py
  status`, then `plan --chapter <N> --source <relative-file> --pages <range>` only
  when the learner reaches that topic; `<N>` must equal `current_phase`, sources are
  limited to PDF or definitely single-frame PNG/JPEG/BMP, a batch is at most eight
  primary pages, and only one batch may remain active. If the learner continues
  after this phase was already marked complete, the same `plan` transition must
  recoverably reopen the completion record; never leave an active batch hidden
  behind a stale completed badge or hand-edit the progress view. Ask the host's native
  visual/PDF capability to render and inspect only those pages. A single-page work
  order has no contact sheet. For multiple pages, overview contact sheets group at
  most four pages and must partition the primary batch exactly once, at roughly
  768 px per row-major tile. Each sheet is consumed once by an `overview` call.
  New visual receipts use schema 3: enumerate stable `teaching_item_ids` on every
  primary page and define each item as `text|figure|mixed` with generic prompt/answer
  components. Each component declares its role, sorted required context IDs, exact
  allowed detected IDs, and a source-qualified crop. Context-only components are
  allowed, but at least one prompt component must visibly contain the target. A
  `detail` call may combine prompt components only for one target; a `solution` call
  may combine answer components only for one target. Every component gets an
  independent one-crop `crop_review` model call whose detected IDs exactly equal its
  declared target/context scope and which proves no unrelated content or student
  attempt. Geometry or a filename is not semantic evidence.
  If an official answer is elsewhere, run `register-answer-dependency --batch-id
  <id> --source <relative-file> --pages <range>` while the batch is planned. This is
  additive. Use `set-answer-dependency ... --pages <exact-range> --reason <reason>`
  to replace/narrow a binding or `remove-answer-dependency ... --reason <reason>` to
  remove it; both are audited and exact retries are idempotent. Every
  primary/dependency page declares content types
  and `answer_provenance`. Dependency pages are answer locators/detail inputs and
  never enter a solution call; only an `official_solution` parent may produce an
  answer component, and every registered official-solution page must be covered by
  one. Student-attempt/unknown pages remain inspectable but
  cannot satisfy answer evidence. Model-call rows bind exact host/model, asset path/hash,
  and source-qualified source ID/path/revision/page locations; bare page numbers are
  insufficient and an asset cannot be reused across ordinary stage calls. A contact
  sheet never replaces a page or prompt component. Every canonical page, dependency-page,
  contact, prompt, and answer evidence file is PNG with matching magic bytes and
  measured dimensions under `.lightweight/assets/`, never under or reused from a
  full-build asset path. Page images are at least 480×480 and item crops at least
  64×64. Every component crop is distinct; answer components remain hidden until
  solution/review.
  Import the receipt with `record-visual`, teach in full beginner-friendly detail,
  persist the exact `notebook/chNN.md#entry-anchor`, then use
  `mark-taught --taught-item-ids <exact-comma-separated-IDs>`. It revalidates
  source/visual/notebook bindings, separates inspected pages from taught item scope,
  and publishes the taught receipt plus
  `phase_evidence[phase].lightweight_batches` under the workspace lock; a retry
  idempotently repairs a taught-first interruption. Never shorten teaching output
  to save input tokens. Lightweight completion requires all current-phase batches
  taught and a one-to-one live event set, skips typed Guide/full-build evidence, and
  may reach `covered_unverified`. At first init, preserve an immutable stat-only
  baseline for any pre-existing standard bank without parsing or hashing it. Only an
  explicit quiz/checkpoint opens the bank and binds the exact bank/item revision.
  `verified` still requires two distinct revision-bound handled items from that
  unchanged pre-existing baseline and one pass; an absent-at-init, replaced, or
  drifted bank and legacy unbound checkpoint rows cannot qualify. Never invent a
  scored quiz.
  Schema-2 visual receipts remain immutable history. A legacy active schema-2
  `visual_ready` attempt is quarantined from recording/teaching and may only be
  auditably abandoned before a new schema-3 attempt. If an unfinished scope must be closed, run `abandon --batch-id <id> --reason
  <concrete-reason>` on its `planned|visual_ready` batch. The hash-bound abandonment
  receipt remains in the ledger and a replacement plan becomes a new attempt. A
  `taught` batch is durable progress and cannot be abandoned. If it must be redone,
  `replace-taught --batch-id <id> --reason <concrete-reason>` retains its receipts,
  notebook binding, and progress event as immutable `superseded` history and opens a
  planned successor for the exact same primary slice; it revalidates dependency
  revisions while preserving their exact page sets. The predecessor/event stays
  auditable but is excluded from the current completion denominator.
  Routine `status` takes a generation-stable read-only snapshot without creating or
  opening a lock for writing; workspace validation performs metadata plus
  physical-identity checks only. Exact stream hashes are recomputed only by `plan`,
  dependency registration/replacement/removal, `record-visual`, `mark-taught`, phase completion, or
  explicit `status --verify-live`. Non-current taught history keeps immutable
  receipt/progress-event consistency checks and is counted as
  `unchecked_historical` until that phase becomes current again. Read
  `status_schema_version=2` and `answer_taint_contract_version=2` before
  interpreting the machine status fields. Read
  `full_page_answer_taint_status` only as a conservative fact about the uncropped
  locator/detail page. Read `answer_taint_status`, `item_crop_review_status`, and
  `teaching_publication_status` as the separate item-crop teaching verdict; a parent
  page containing a student attempt does not relabel clean reviewed crops plus an
  official answer crop as blocked.
- `full` is explicit opt-in. It opens `ingest_course.py` and the validated structured
  build/review route. It still does not imply `artifact_mode=visual` and does not
  authorize a PDF without that separate explicit choice.

To switch modes, use `update_progress.py --workspace <ws> set --processing-mode
lightweight|full`, then rerun `exam_start.py confirm` so the runtime/start receipt
describes the selected route. Switching to lightweight does not delete a prior
structured workspace; it only forbids eager rebuilds and uses existing current
artifacts lazily when they remain valid. Reconfirming later without a processing
flag preserves this canonical choice.

### Artifact output

`study_state.json.artifact_mode` is `chat` or `visual`:

- `chat` is the safe default for missing/legacy/unknown values: conversation plus notebook/state, with no automatic chapter HTML/PDF or cheat-sheet PDF.
- `visual` persists only after an explicit choice via `update_progress.py ... set --artifact-mode visual`; it requests typed manifest → render → receipt → every-page QA. Delivery and completion require `artifact_ready=ready`. Failure stays blocked/degraded. It never permits silent installation.

The stored preference remains independent from processing intensity. Under
`processing_mode=lightweight`, even a stored `visual` is reported as
`artifact_mode_preference=visual`, `artifact_mode_effective=chat`, and
`artifact_mode_dormant=true`; it becomes active only after an explicit switch to
`full`. A one-shot Guide request likewise requires that switch rather than bypassing
the lightweight boundary.

An explicit return uses `set --artifact-mode chat`. A one-shot request temporarily overrides `chat` without changing the stored preference. Never inspect or infer a subscription tier. A language change stales prior-language manifests/artifacts; re-author/import and, when visual output is requested, rerender and repeat all-page QA.

## Output Contract

- Persist substantive walkthroughs, grading feedback, confusion explanations, and review conclusions first with `scripts/notebook.py add-entry`; wrong/skipped items also use `--mistake`. Then send a 3–5 line digest plus the language-pack notebook link. A failed write is reported and the full content stays in chat. Only progress panels, the static help card, and one-shot escape hints are exempt; file-less clients use chat/text breakpoints.
- Dispatch student prose from `study_state.json.language` with SINGLE-LANGUAGE PURITY: `zh` is pure Simplified Chinese; `en` is pure English using canonical vocabulary (default if unset unless the opening was Chinese); `bilingual` mirrors each zh block under `> EN:`. Machine IDs, keys, hashes, enums, statuses, and reason codes remain stable. Original-language evidence may remain only when explicitly labelled; agent prose still follows the selected language.
- Be concise and conclusion-first. End every reply with localized subject/current-stage/progress/mistake fields.
- Use the full canonical provenance sentences: 🟢 来自资料 / 🟢 From your materials; 🟡 AI补充，可能与你老师讲的不完全一致 / 🟡 AI-supplemented — may differ from what your teacher taught; ⚠️ AI生成答案，非老师/教材提供 / ⚠️ AI-generated answer — not from your teacher or textbook. Unsupported answers always carry the full ⚠️ label. If materials give no basis, say 「资料里没有这道题的答案」 or “The materials do not contain an answer to this question.”

### Heavy capability boundary

Never download, install, import, or execute MinerU, Docling, or LangGraph in the
student's local environment. The lightweight route never offers them. A full-mode
learner must explicitly request a named heavy capability before it can be proposed,
and execution must occur in a host-supplied remote/cloud service with separately
confirmed upload/privacy terms. If the active host has no such remote integration,
say it is unavailable and stay on native visual/core review; an installed local
package is not permission to use it. Workspace files and `study_state.json`, not a
remote workflow checkpoint, remain the state truth.

## Language packs

Load the selected pack before student-visible output:

- `中文` → [`../../locales/zh/skills/exam-cram.md`](../../locales/zh/skills/exam-cram.md)
- `English` → [`../../locales/en/skills/exam-cram.md`](../../locales/en/skills/exam-cram.md)
- `双语` → compose both blockwise, zh then `> EN:`, under [`docs/language-policy.md`](../../docs/language-policy.md)

Display aliases are normalized to `zh|en|bilingual`; unset language is decided by the combined first ask.

## Boundaries

- `study_state.json` is the single source of truth. Write it only through `python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/update_progress.py" --workspace <ws> ...`; `study_progress.md` is generated. Fail writes loudly. With Python, initialize missing state; direct Markdown maintenance is true no-Python fallback only.
- Default question scope is mixed. A recorded restricted scope excludes/counts items without `source_type`. Before a one-turn override say 「⚠️ 临时覆盖你的 <scope> 范围偏好」 / `⚠️ Temporarily overriding your <scope> scope preference`.
- Ordinary selection uses `scripts/select_questions.py`. Checkpoints use `python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/select_hard_questions.py" --workspace <ws> --chapter <current> --mode <mode> -n <k>`. `--chapter` is exact; never replace it with `--from-chapter`, which means all numeric chapters ≥N and is only for `shore_up`. Cross-chapter practice may omit the chapter only when explicitly requested. The selector combines structural difficulty from `score_difficulty.py` with mistake/confusion/window state, respects stored scope, and requires explicit chapter/from-chapter for `shore_up`.
- Stay within student materials; label supplements or abstain. Never claim what the teacher said, contact teacher/registrar, invent bank replacements, lecture from memory without the wiki, or disguise AI as material.
