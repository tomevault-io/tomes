# Multi-Agent Orchestration

## Overview

Treat a multi-agent system as a constrained production system, not as a loose collection of helpers. Define role contracts, context shape, permissions, tools, MCP access, records, and cleanup before any agent starts working.

## Source Anchors

- `src/tools/AgentTool/`
- `src/tools/AgentTool/runAgent.ts`
- `src/tools/AgentTool/built-in/`

## Workflow

1. Decide which work must stay on the main critical path and which work can be delegated.
2. Write an explicit contract for each agent type: goal, allowed tools, default model, async or sync behavior, and permission strategy.
3. Choose a context strategy for each agent: full fork, slim fork, or task-only prompt.
4. Scope permissions so parent session grants do not leak into child agents by accident.
5. Preload the right skills, frontmatter hooks, and agent-specific MCP servers before execution starts.
6. Record transcripts, metadata, parent-child hierarchy, and progress messages so runs stay auditable and resumable.
7. Define stop conditions such as `maxTurns`, abort propagation, and completion callbacks.
8. In `finally`, clean up MCP clients, session hooks, prompt-cache tracking, file state, and orphaned todo entries.

## Design Rules

- Keep final responsibility on the main agent. Delegation does not delegate accountability.
- Separate sync collaboration from async background work because permission behavior differs.
- Treat agent-specific MCP as additive, and only clean up the connections created for that agent.
- Drop irrelevant inherited context for read-only agents such as stale git state or large policy files they do not need.
- Persist enough metadata for resume paths to reconstruct the correct agent shape.
- Treat skill preloading as part of startup, not as an optional convenience.

## Failure Modes

- Delegating blocking critical-path work and leaving the main agent idle.
- Letting child agents inherit allow rules that were never intended for them.
- Running async agents on an interactive permission path they cannot complete.
- Failing to record sidechain transcripts and then losing resume continuity.
- Skipping cleanup and leaving behind live MCP connections or leaked state.

## Output

- Produce an agent matrix with role, permissions, tools, model, and exit conditions.
- Produce a delegation policy that says when to stay local, when to delegate, and when to parallelize.
- Produce a lifecycle checklist that covers spawn, progress, resume, abort, and cleanup.
