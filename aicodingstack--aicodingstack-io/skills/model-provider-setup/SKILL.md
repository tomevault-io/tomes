# Model Provider Setup

## Overview

This skill configures `.claude/settings.local.json` to use alternative AI model providers that offer Anthropic-compatible APIs. It guides the setup of custom base URLs, model selections, and API authentication for providers beyond the default Anthropic service.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when users:
- Want to switch to alternative model providers (Z.AI, OpenRouter, etc.)
- Need to configure custom API endpoints for Claude Code
- Ask about setting up API keys for different providers
- Request help configuring model provider settings

## Setup Workflow

### Step 1: Read Provider Configurations

Read the provider configurations from `references/providers.json` to understand available providers, their base URLs, and supported models.

The JSON structure contains:
- Provider ID and display name
- Description of the provider
- Base URL for API requests
- List of available models with IDs and descriptions

### Step 2: Present Provider Options to User

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to present available providers to the user. Structure the question as follows:

**Question format:**
- Header: "Provider"
- Question: "Which model provider would you like to configure?"
- Options: Build from providers.json, using provider name as label and description as the option description
- multiSelect: false (single provider selection)

### Step 3: Present Model Options for Selected Provider

After the user selects a provider, use `AskUserQuestion` again to let them choose a model from that provider's available models.

**Question format:**
- Header: "Model"
- Question: "Which model would you like to use?"
- Options: Build from the selected provider's models array, using model name as label and description as the option description
- multiSelect: false (single model selection)

### Step 4: Collect API Key

Use `AskUserQuestion` to collect the API key for the selected provider.

**Question format:**
- Header: "API Key"
- Question: "Please enter your API key for [provider name]:"
- Options: Provide 2 options:
  - Label: "I'll enter my API key", Description: "Type or paste your API key in the 'Other' field below"
  - Label: "I'll add it manually later", Description: "Set up the configuration with a placeholder that you'll replace later"
- multiSelect: false

**Important:** If the user selects "Other" and provides a custom text input, that is their API key. If they choose "I'll add it manually later", use the placeholder `"<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>"`.

### Step 5: Update .claude/settings.local.json

Read the existing `.claude/settings.local.json` file if it exists. If it doesn't exist, create a new one.

Update or create the configuration with the following structure:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "<selected provider's baseUrl>",
    "ANTHROPIC_MODEL": "<selected model's id>",
    "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "<user's API key or placeholder>"
  }
}
```

**Important considerations:**
- Preserve any existing configuration in settings.local.json that is not related to these three env variables
- Merge the new env variables with existing ones
- Use proper JSON formatting with 2-space indentation

### Step 6: Confirm Setup

After updating the configuration file, inform the user:
1. Which provider and model were configured
2. The location of the settings file: `.claude/settings.local.json`
3. If a placeholder was used, remind them to replace `<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>` with their actual API key
4. Note that they need to restart Claude Code for the changes to take effect

## Adding New Providers

To add new model providers to this skill, edit `references/providers.json` and add a new provider object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-provider-id",
  "name": "Display Name",
  "description": "Brief description of the provider",
  "baseUrl": "https://api.example.com/v1",
  "models": [
    {
      "id": "model-identifier",
      "name": "Model Display Name",
      "description": "Brief description of the model"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Resources

### references/providers.json

Contains the configuration database for all supported model providers. This file includes:
- Provider metadata (ID, name, description)
- API base URLs
- Available models for each provider

This file should be read at the start of the workflow to populate the provider and model selection options.
