# Check issue handling time
gh issue list --repo owner/repo --state open --sort created | head -10

# Check release activity
gh release list --repo owner/repo --limit 10

# Check stargazers/forks (community engagement)
gh repo view owner/repo --json | jq '.stargazersCount, .forksCount'

# Check for unmaintained status indicators
