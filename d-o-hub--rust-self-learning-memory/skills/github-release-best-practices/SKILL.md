# GitHub Release Best Practices

Systematic approach to GitHub release preparation following 2025 best practices for Rust workspace projects.

## Purpose

Establish comprehensive release management procedures for Rust workspaces with multiple crates, ensuring professional-grade releases with proper versioning, changelog management, and quality gate enforcement.

## 2025 GitHub Release Best Practices

### Immutable Releases (New in 2025)

**What it is**: GitHub's supply chain security feature that locks releases after publication.

**Key Benefits**:
- Assets cannot be added, modified, or deleted after publishing
- Release tags are protected and cannot be moved
- Cryptographic attestations enable verification
- Protects against post-release tampering

**Implementation Strategy**:
```bash
# Draft-first approach for immutable releases
gh release create v0.1.8 --draft
# Review content, attach assets, then publish
gh release edit v0.1.8 --publish
```

### Auto-Generated Release Notes

**Features**:
- Lists merged pull requests automatically
- Identifies and lists contributors
- Provides links to full changelog
- Customizable via `.github/release.yml` configuration

**Configuration Example** (`.github/release.yml`):
```yaml
changelog:
  exclude:
    labels:
      - ignore-for-release
      - dependencies
    authors:
      - dependabot
  categories:
    - title: 🚀 New Features
      labels:
        - feature
        - enhancement
    - title: 🐛 Bug Fixes
      labels:
        - bug
        - fix
    - title: 📚 Documentation
      labels:
        - documentation
        - docs
    - title: 🔧 Other Changes
      labels:
        - "*"
```

**Best Practice**: Use auto-generation as starting point, then always review and refine before publishing. Recent implementations show 90% reduction in effort (2-3 hours → 15 minutes review time).

## Automated Changelog Generation from Git History

### Git Command Strategies

**Analyze Changes Since Last Release**:
```bash
# Get commits since last release
git log v0.1.7..HEAD --oneline --decorate

# Group commits by type using conventional commits
git log --grep="^feat|^fix|^docs|^chore|^refactor" v0.1.7..HEAD

# Generate commit summary with PR references
git log v0.1.7..HEAD --pretty=format:"- %s (%h)" --abbrev-commit
```

**Extract PR Information**:
```bash
# Get PR numbers from commit messages
git log v0.1.7..HEAD --grep="#[0-9]" --pretty=format:"- %s (Closes %h)"

# Extract breaking changes
git log v0.1.7..BREAKING --pretty=format:"- **BREAKING**: %s"
```

### Keep a Changelog Format Implementation

**Required Structure**:
```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Version Bump Strategies for Rust Workspaces

### Semantic Versioning Decision Matrix

| Change Type | Version Bump | Example | Rationale |
|-------------|--------------|---------|-----------|
| Breaking Changes | MAJOR | 0.1.7 → 1.0.0 | Public API changes |
| New Features | MINOR | 0.1.7 → 0.2.0 | Backward-compatible additions |
| Bug Fixes | PATCH | 0.1.7 → 0.1.8 | Backward-compatible fixes |
| CI/Quality | PATCH | 0.1.7 → 0.1.8 | Infrastructure improvements |
| Documentation | PATCH | 0.1.7 → 0.1.8 | Non-functional changes |

### Workspace Version Coordination

**Root Cargo.toml Management**:
```toml
[workspace.package]
version = "0.1.8"  # Single source of truth

[workspace.members]
# All members inherit workspace.package version
```

**Version Validation**:
```bash
# Check version consistency across workspace
cargo metadata --format-version 1 --no-deps | \
  jq '.packages[] | select(.name != "rust-self-learning-memory") | {name, version}'

# Validate all crates have consistent versions
cargo workspaces version --all
```

### Special Considerations for 0.x Versions

**During 0.x Development**:
- "Anything MAY change at any time"
- "The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable"
- Standard semver guarantees are relaxed
- Typically increment MINOR (0.1.x → 0.2.0) for most changes
- PATCH reserved for critical bug fixes only

## Release Validation Workflows

### Pre-Release Quality Gates

**CI/CD Validation**:
```bash
# Run comprehensive quality checks
./scripts/quality-gates.sh

# Specific validations
./scripts/code-quality.sh fmt
./scripts/code-quality.sh clippy --workspace
cargo test --all
cargo audit
cargo deny check
```

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Maintain >90% test coverage across all modules
- Zero clippy warnings with strict linting
- All GitHub Actions workflows passing
- Security audit clean with no known vulnerabilities

### Release Creation Validation

**Git Tag Management**:
```bash
# Create annotated tag with release message
git tag -a v0.1.8 -m "Release v0.1.8 - CI fixes and code quality improvements"

# Verify tag creation
git show v0.1.8

# Push tag to trigger release workflow
git push origin v0.1.8
```

**GitHub Release Validation**:
```bash
# Create release with auto-generated notes
gh release create v0.1.8 \
  --title "v0.1.8 - CI Fixes and Code Quality" \
  --notes "See CHANGELOG.md for details"

# Verify release creation
gh release view v0.1.8 --json tagName,createdAt,url
```

            --draft
```

## Modern Release Tooling (2026 — ADR-034)

### cargo-semver-checks (API Compatibility)
```bash
cargo install --locked cargo-semver-checks
cargo semver-checks check-release --workspace
```
Catches accidental breaking changes before release.

### cargo-release (Version Management)
```bash
cargo install --locked cargo-release
# Handles version bump, commit, tag, push in one command
cargo release patch  # or minor/major
```

Configure via `release.toml`:
```toml
[workspace]
allow-branch = ["main"]
pre-release-commit-message = "release: v{{version}}"
tag-message = "v{{version}}"
tag-prefix = "v"
```

### cargo-dist (Binary Distribution)
```bash
cargo install --locked cargo-dist
cargo dist init
```
Generates: platform tarballs, checksums (SHA256), shell/PowerShell installers, release.yml workflow.

**CRITICAL: Version Must Match Tag**
cargo-dist requires `Cargo.toml` version to match the git tag. If they mismatch:
```
× This workspace doesn't have anything for dist to Release!
help: --tag=v0.1.21 will Announce: do-memory-mcp, do-memory-cli
```

**Prevention**:
1. Use `cargo release` (handles version + tag atomically)
2. Or manually verify: `grep '^version =' Cargo.toml` matches tag (without 'v')

**v0.1.22 Incident**: Tag pushed with Cargo.toml still at 0.1.21 → workflow failed.
