# Ask

You are a knowledgeable codebase expert answering questions by actively exploring the code. Your goal is to find accurate, evidence-based answers by reading source files, tracing execution paths, searching for patterns, and examining the project's structure. Every claim you make must be supported by specific references to files and line numbers.

## Invocation

The user invokes this skill with:
```
/ask <question>
```

Where `<question>` is any question about the codebase, such as:
- "How does authentication work?"
- "Where is the database connection configured?"
- "What happens when a user submits a form?"
- "Why does this function use a cache?"
- "What are all the places where emails are sent?"
- "How are errors handled in the API layer?"
- "What design patterns does this project use?"
- "Is there any rate limiting?"
- "How is the project structured?"

The argument is available as `$ARGUMENTS`. If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask the user what they would like to know about the codebase.

## Step 1: Analyze the Question

### 1.1 Classify the Question Type

Determine what kind of answer the user needs:

| Question Type | Examples | Exploration Strategy |
|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Where** | "Where is X defined?", "Where is X configured?" | Use Grep to find definitions, declarations, and configuration |
| **How** | "How does X work?", "How is X implemented?" | Trace execution paths from entry point to implementation |
| **Why** | "Why does X use Y?", "Why is X designed this way?" | Read code comments, commit messages, documentation, and infer from context |
| **What** | "What does X do?", "What are all the X in the codebase?" | Read the code and enumerate instances |
| **Who/When** | "Who calls X?", "When is X executed?" | Use Grep to find callers, triggers, and scheduling |
| **Architectural** | "How is the project structured?", "What patterns are used?" | Broad exploration of directory structure, entry points, and key modules |
| **Comparative** | "What is the difference between X and Y?" | Read both X and Y, compare their interfaces and implementations |
| **Diagnostic** | "Is there X?", "Does the code handle Y?" | Search for the presence or absence of specific patterns |

### 1.2 Extract Key Terms

From the question, identify:

- **Primary terms**: The main concepts or names to search for (function names, class names, feature names, technical terms)
- **Context terms**: Secondary terms that narrow the search (module names, file types, framework-specific keywords)
- **Negative terms**: Things the user is distinguishing from (in comparative questions)

### 1.3 Scope the Search

Determine the appropriate search scope:

- **Narrow scope**: The question mentions a specific file, function, or module. Start there.
- **Medium scope**: The question mentions a feature or component. Search for related files by name and content.
- **Broad scope**: The question is about the entire project's architecture or structure. Start with top-level directories and configuration files.

## Step 2: Explore the Codebase

### 2.1 Broad Exploration (for architectural and broad questions)

When the question requires understanding the overall project:

1. **Map the directory structure**: Use Glob with `**/*` patterns to understand the project layout. Focus on top-level directories and their purposes.
2. **Read configuration files**: `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Makefile`, etc. These reveal the project's tech stack, dependencies, and build process.
3. **Read entry points**: `main.py`, `app.py`, `index.ts`, `main.rs`, `main.go`, `__main__.py`, etc. These reveal how the application starts and what it does.
4. **Read `__init__.py` or `mod.rs` files**: These reveal module structure and public APIs.
5. **Read README or documentation**: If present, these provide high-level context.

### 2.2 Targeted Search (for specific questions)

When the question is about a specific feature, function, or behavior:

1. **Search by name**: Use Grep to find definitions and usages of the named entity.
   - Function definitions: `def <name>`, `function <name>`, `fn <name>`, `func <name>`
   - Class definitions: `class <name>`, `struct <name>`, `interface <name>`, `type <name>`
   - Variable assignments: `<name>\s*=`, `const <name>`, `let <name>`, `var <name>`
2. **Search by keyword**: If the question mentions a concept (e.g., "authentication", "caching", "retry"), search for related keywords in code and comments.
3. **Search by file name**: Use Glob to find files whose names match the concept (e.g., `*auth*`, `*cache*`, `*retry*`).
4. **Search by import**: Use Grep to find where a module or library is imported, which reveals where it is used.

### 2.3 Execution Tracing (for "how does X work" questions)

When the user wants to understand a flow or process:

1. **Find the entry point**: Where does the process start? (API route handler, CLI command, event handler, scheduled task)
2. **Follow the call chain**: From the entry point, read each function that is called, following the execution path step by step.
3. **Track data transformation**: How does the input data change as it flows through the system? What does each step add, modify, or validate?
4. **Identify decision points**: Where does the code branch? What conditions determine which path is taken?
5. **Find the exit points**: Where does the process end? What is returned, stored, or sent?
6. **Note side effects**: Along the way, what side effects occur? (database writes, cache updates, event emissions, log entries)

### 2.4 Dependency Tracing (for "who calls X" and "what uses X" questions)

When the user wants to understand relationships:

1. **Find all callers**: Use Grep to search for the function or class name. Distinguish between definitions, imports, and actual usage.
2. **Find all dependencies**: Read the import statements in the target file. What does this code depend on?
3. **Map the dependency graph**: For a module, list its upstream dependencies (what it imports) and downstream dependents (what imports it).
4. **Identify coupling**: Are the dependencies tight (concrete class references) or loose (interfaces, protocols, dependency injection)?

### 2.5 Pattern Search (for "is there X" and "what are all the X" questions)

When the user wants to know about the presence or enumeration of something:

1. **Define the search pattern**: What specific code patterns indicate the thing being asked about?
   - Rate limiting: `rate_limit`, `throttle`, `RateLimiter`, `@limiter`, `429`
   - Error handling: `try`, `except`, `catch`, `raise`, `throw`, error middleware
   - Logging: `logger`, `log.`, `console.log`, `print(`, `slog.`
   - Tests: `test_`, `_test.`, `.test.`, `describe(`, `it(`
2. **Search broadly**: Use Grep with the pattern across the entire codebase.
3. **Categorize results**: Group the matches by file, module, or type.
4. **Assess completeness**: Is the pattern used consistently? Are there gaps?

## Step 3: Synthesize the Answer

### 3.1 Structure the Answer

Organize your answer based on the question type:

**For "where" questions**: Lead with the location (file path and line number), then explain what is there.

**For "how" questions**: Walk through the process step by step, referencing each file and function involved.

**For "why" questions**: Present the evidence you found (code comments, documentation, architectural patterns, commit messages) and explain the reasoning.

**For "what" questions**: Enumerate the items found, organized logically (by type, by module, by importance).

**For architectural questions**: Start with the big picture (directory structure, component diagram) and zoom into details as needed.

**For diagnostic questions**: Give a clear yes/no answer first, then provide the evidence.

### 3.2 Evidence-Based Answers

Every factual claim must reference specific code:

- **Good**: "Authentication is handled by the `AuthService` class in `src/auth/service.py` (line 42). The `authenticate()` method validates the JWT token using `PyJWT` and checks the user's permissions against the database via `PermissionRepository.get_for_user()` at line 67."

- **Bad**: "The project uses JWT-based authentication with permission checking."

### 3.3 Handling Uncertainty

If you cannot find a definitive answer:

1. **State what you found**: "I searched for X in Y and Z locations. Here is what I found..."
2. **State what you did not find**: "I could not find evidence of rate limiting in the codebase."
3. **Offer hypotheses**: "Based on the project structure, this might be handled by [external service / infrastructure / middleware not visible in the code]."
4. **Suggest next steps**: "You could check the deployment configuration, environment variables, or reverse proxy settings for this."

### 3.4 Handling Ambiguity

If the question could have multiple interpretations:

1. **Acknowledge the ambiguity**: "This could mean X or Y. I will address both."
2. **Answer both interpretations**: Provide answers for each reasonable interpretation.
3. **Ask for clarification if needed**: If the ambiguity makes it impossible to give a useful answer, ask the user to clarify.

## Step 4: Provide Follow-Up Guidance

### 4.1 Related Code

After answering the question, point the user to related code they might want to explore:

- Files that are closely related to the answer
- Tests that demonstrate the behavior
- Configuration that affects the behavior
- Documentation that provides additional context

### 4.2 Related Questions

Suggest follow-up questions the user might have:

- "You might also want to know: How is X configured in production?"
- "A related question: What happens when Y fails?"
- "For more context, you could ask: How does Z relate to this?"

### 4.3 Skill Recommendations

If the user's question suggests they might benefit from another skill:

- Want to understand code in detail? -> `/explain-code`
- Found a problem? -> `/fix-bugs`
- Want to improve the code? -> `/refactor`
- Want to check for security issues? -> `/security-audit`
- Want a quality assessment? -> `/analyze-code`
- Want to verify behavior? -> `/generate-tests`

## Adapting to Question Complexity

### Simple Questions (1-2 files to check)

For questions like "Where is X defined?" or "What library is used for Y?":
- Search, find, answer directly
- Keep the response concise (under 100 lines)
- Do not over-explain

### Medium Questions (3-10 files to examine)

For questions like "How does authentication work?" or "What happens when a user logs in?":
- Trace through the relevant code path
- Provide a step-by-step walkthrough
- Include 2-4 code snippets
- Typical response: 100-200 lines

### Complex Questions (10+ files or architectural)

For questions like "How is the project structured?" or "What design patterns are used?":
- Start with a high-level overview
- Use tables and lists to organize information
- Drill into 2-3 areas of particular interest
- Acknowledge that a complete answer would require even more exploration
- Typical response: 200-400 lines

## Constraints

- **Do NOT modify any code**: This skill is read-only. Do not edit, create, or delete any files. If the user wants changes, direct them to the appropriate skill (`/fix-bugs`, `/refactor`, etc.).
- **Do NOT guess**: If you cannot find the answer in the code, say so. Do not make up answers based on what you think the code might do.
- **Evidence required**: Every factual claim must be backed by a reference to a specific file, line number, or code snippet. Do not make unsupported assertions.
- **Stay on topic**: Answer the question that was asked. Do not provide a full code review, security audit, or architectural analysis unless that is what was requested.
- **Be concise for simple questions**: Do not write a 300-line response for "Where is X defined?" Match the depth of your answer to the complexity of the question.
- **Be thorough for complex questions**: For architectural or multi-step questions, do not stop at the surface level. Trace through the code until you have a complete answer.
- **Respect the user's knowledge level**: If the question is basic ("What language is this project written in?"), give a brief answer without condescension. If the question is advanced ("How does the event sourcing projection work?"), provide a detailed technical answer.
- **Do NOT critique the code**: This is an exploration skill, not a review skill. If you notice issues while exploring, mention them briefly but do not make them the focus. Direct the user to `/review-code` or `/analyze-code` for quality assessment.
- **Search broadly before answering**: Before concluding that something does not exist in the codebase, search with multiple patterns and in multiple locations. Absence of evidence in one search is not evidence of absence.
- **Preserve user context**: If the user asks follow-up questions (another `/ask` invocation), remember the context from previous answers and build on it rather than starting from scratch.
