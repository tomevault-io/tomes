# Fluent (bootstrap shim)

This is a bootstrap shim. It installs the `fluent` binary if missing, then
materializes the full fluent skill from the binary so the skill always matches
the installed version.

## Step 1 — Install the binary if missing

```sh
fluent --version
```

If `fluent` is not found, install it:

```sh
curl -fsSL fluent.computer/install | sh
```

The installer puts `fluent` in `~/.local/bin`. If `fluent --version` still
fails after installation, use the full path `~/.local/bin/fluent` for all
subsequent commands, and tell the user to add `~/.local/bin` to their `PATH`.

## Step 2 — Materialize the full skill

Run the following to install the full fluent skill from the binary:

```sh
fluent skills add
```

The public `npx skills add` command may have created a project-local bootstrap
under `.agents/skills`, `.claude/skills`, or `.codex/skills` and an entry in
`skills-lock.json`. This command replaces only a Fluent-marked bootstrap,
records Fluent ownership, and removes only Fluent's matching lock entry. It
preserves other locked skills and any unrecognized or user-owned skill
directory. It does not create an absent agent-specific skill root. A later
coder profile selection controls Fluent's Writer and reviewers, not where this
interactive skill is installed.

## Step 3 — Continue with the full skill

Read the full fluent skill from the data directory the binary wrote to:

```
~/.local/share/fluent/skills/fluent/SKILL.md
```

Read that file now with the Read tool (expand `~` to the user's home directory).
Follow its instructions from the beginning as if this shim had not been loaded.
The full skill replaces this shim — do not return to these instructions.
