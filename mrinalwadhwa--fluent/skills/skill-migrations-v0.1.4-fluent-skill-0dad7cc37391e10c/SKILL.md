description: Operate the fluent workflow to build software autonomously over extended periods. Interactive stages (brief, behaviors, approach, plan) run with the user. Autonomous execution loops writer → tester → parallel reviewers, then runs the Learner after a passing review round. Only a successful Learner run produces a ready Merge Candidate. A retryable Learner failure resumes with `fluent attempt run`; a non-relaunchable evidence failure stays blocked for human recovery. When a decision needs a human, it sets `needs-user` and pauses, then resumes once the user resolves it. Use when this capability is needed.

# Fluent

Follow a structured workflow: capture intent, define behaviors, design an approach, plan execution, execute, and review. Some stages need the user; others run autonomously.

Behaviors describe what the system must do; the approach describes how. If execution reveals the approach doesn't work, adapt it — or propose a change via `needs-user` if the change is significant. If a behavior turns out to be wrong or incomplete, pause and renegotiate rather than deliver the wrong thing.

## Work model

The delegated build lifecycle is the Work model: Work Item → Attempt → Task → Workspace → Merge Candidate. Work Items represent planned Fluent work, Attempts carry one execution history, Tasks are schedulable units, and Workspaces are the filesystem contexts Tasks read or write. A Merge Candidate record may exist while the Learner is retryable; it becomes ready to land only after the Learner succeeds.

## Make sure fluent is installed

Everything below uses the `fluent` command. Check that it is available before running any other step:

```sh
fluent --version
```

If `fluent` is not found, install it and check again:

```sh
curl -fsSL fluent.computer/install | sh
fluent --version
```

The installer puts `fluent` in `~/.local/bin`. If the second check still fails, that directory is not on the current `PATH`: run the rest of this workflow with the full path `~/.local/bin/fluent`, and tell the user to add `~/.local/bin` to their `PATH` for future sessions.

## On session start

First check whether `.fluent/` exists. If it does not, complete
“First-time project setup” below before running `fluent status` or any Work
command.

Run `fluent status` or `fluent work-item list` to see current Work. If stored Work Items exist, inspect the relevant one with `fluent work-item show <work-item-id>`. Continue the latest non-terminal Attempt when the next action is clear, or present the `needs-user` handoff when an Attempt or Merge Candidate asks for user input.

If `fluent status` shows a `merge-ready` Merge Candidate, inspect it with
`fluent merge-candidate show <work-item-id> <merge-candidate-id>`. Present it
to the user for inspection. Run `fluent merge-candidate land <work-item-id>`
only after the user accepts the candidate. Do not start `fluent auto-merge`;
it is outside the Local Preview.

If nothing needs attention, ask the user what they want to build.

## Fluent tracks its own state in the repo

fluent stores its learned project model (`expertise/`) and test config (`tester.yaml`, `extract-tester-results`) in `.fluent/` and commits them alongside the user's changes so they persist across runs. On a repo's first run, tell the user this is expected, so they aren't surprised to see `.fluent/` files in their history.

## Interactive stages (user present)

Follow the four stage procedures in order. Each is a reference file in this skill — read it when entering that stage. Each writes into `.fluent/drafts/<draft-id>/` — don't create planning files outside that directory:

- `references/capture-brief.md` — interview the user and write `brief.md`.
- `references/define-behaviors.md` — elaborate the brief into EARS statements and write `behaviors.diff.md`.
- `references/design-approach.md` — decide the technical approach and write `approach.md`.
- `references/plan-execution.md` — plan the steps and write `plan.md`, then create the Work Item.

For a codebase, module, or area review (not building something new), capture enough context to create a Work Item and use the review-only flow in the delegated stages below.

## Delegated execution

`references/plan-execution.md` has already created the Work Item(s) with the approved planning files. From here, use the Work model for delegated execution:

1. Create an Attempt: `fluent attempt create <work-item-id>`. (An `attempt-N` id is auto-assigned; pass an explicit id for scripted flows.)
2. Run the Attempt: `fluent attempt run <work-item-id>`. (Defaults to the most recently created Attempt; pass an explicit id to target a specific one.)
3. Inspect status with `fluent status` or `fluent work-item show <work-item-id>`.
4. Stop when the Attempt produces a ready Merge Candidate. Present it to the
   user for inspection with
   `fluent merge-candidate show <work-item-id> <merge-candidate-id>`.
5. Only after the user explicitly accepts that candidate, run
   `fluent merge-candidate land <work-item-id>`. (Defaults to the most recently
   created Merge Candidate; pass an explicit id to target a specific one.)

Delegated execution runs as a loop until it produces a ready Merge Candidate,
stops at a Learner failure, or pauses at `needs-user`. Each round:

1. The writer produces a candidate commit.
2. The Tester Task runs the project's tests.
3. Domain reviewers evaluate in parallel.
4. After the reviewers pass, the Learner runs in the Work Item's Learner mode:
   in the default `capture` mode it captures durable project expertise, while in
   `no-expertise` mode it audits the change without writing expertise. Either
   way it records possible follow-ups for materialization after land.

The round outcome determines what happens next:

- Reviewers pass and the Learner succeeds — Attempt creates a ready Merge Candidate.
- Learner fails with a relaunchable disposition — the Merge Candidate remains
  non-ready and cannot land; `fluent attempt run` retries only the Learner.
- Learner fails after its coder ran but host evidence remains pending — the
  candidate is `learner-blocked`; inspect the Work Item and recover the evidence
  with human intervention. Do not rerun the Learner or land the candidate.
- Any fail — follow-up write next round, scoped to failed reviewers.
- Any uncertain, or a round cap reached — Attempt records `needs-user`, pausing the loop.

The user provides input; `fluent attempt run` resumes the loop where it left off.

### Codex authentication pauses

Autonomous Codex workers use a private authentication home and do not load the
interactive Codex configuration or hooks. If Fluent pauses an Attempt for Codex
authentication, run `codex login`, then resume the same work with `fluent attempt
run <work-item-id> [attempt-id]`. Interactive Codex sessions continue to use the
user's normal configuration and hooks.

For unrelated work that can proceed in parallel, create independent Work Items.

For codebase, module, or area review-only work, create a Work Item, run `fluent review codebase <work-item-id> <attempt-id>`, then `fluent attempt run <work-item-id> <attempt-id>`.

### Coder selection

`fluent attempt run` prints the resolved coder, model, and effort for each role
(writer, reviewer, behavior-tests) before the first round. Before launching an
expensive run, present this plan to the user and confirm. Override per-run with
`--coder`, `--model`, `--effort`, or per-role variants (`--write-model`,
`--review-effort`, etc.). Configure defaults in `.fluent/config.yaml` (project)
or `~/.config/fluent/config.yaml` (user):

```yaml
coders:
  writer:
    coder: claude
    # model: optional — omit to use the coder's own default
    effort: high
  reviewer:
    coder: claude
  behavior-tests:
    coder: claude
```

## Local Preview

Fluent's first release is the **Local Preview**: a supervised, local-first path you can try before its background execution, interruption, concurrency, and remote-execution hardening is complete. The default path stays visible and human-controlled:

- Attempts run **locally in the foreground** — you watch each round as it happens.
- Corrective follow-up findings become **proposed follow-up Work** by default.
- `fluent work-item authorize <work-item-id>` authorizes and enqueues proposed
  Work. Authorization does not run an Attempt and never authorizes landing.
- Queued Work starts only while a human explicitly runs `fluent scheduler run`.
  The scheduler never lands a candidate; after successful Learning it stops at
  a ready Merge Candidate.
- **Every ready Merge Candidate is inspected and landed by a human** with
  `fluent merge-candidate land <work-item-id>`.
- Post-merge review is **off by default** and remains a positive per-land
  opt-in with `fluent merge-candidate land --post-merge-review`.

`fluent auto-merge`, automatic scheduler lifecycle, automatic landing, and
Fargate are outside the Local Preview.

## First-time project setup

When `.fluent/` does not exist:

1. Before running `fluent init`, ask:

   ```text
   Which follow-up mode should this project use?

   (a) propose — corrective findings become proposed Work you authorize
       (recommended: keeps the Local Preview human-controlled)
   (b) execute — corrective findings are authorized and queued automatically
   ```

2. After the user chooses, run `fluent init`.

3. If the user chose `propose`, leave `.fluent/config.yaml` unchanged.

4. If the user chose `execute`, write this nested mapping to
   `.fluent/config.yaml` after init:

   ```yaml
   follow-up:
     mode: execute
   ```

`execute` authorizes and queues trusted corrective Work. It does not start
execution. A human must separately run `fluent scheduler run`; any resulting
ready Merge Candidate still requires human inspection and landing.

## Writer testing contract

The writer produces tests alongside code. When committing a candidate:

- `.fluent/tester.yaml` declares the project's test commands (one entry per harness, e.g., Rust nextest + shell).
- Each EARS statement has either a `Test:` reference pointing at a real test or an `Untestable:` marker with a one-line reason.
- Run the project's tests before committing (best practice, not enforced).

The Tester Task runs after the write completes and produces `tester-results.json` for reviewers.

## When to pause

Pause and set status to `needs-user` when:
- You are genuinely uncertain about intent, approach, or scope
- You discover a defined behavior is wrong or incomplete
- You need to deviate significantly from the approach
- A reviewer returns `uncertain`
- You encounter a decision with significant consequences that could go multiple ways
- You need access, credentials, or information you don't have

Don't pause for:
- Decisions you can make confidently from context
- Minor implementation choices within the approach
- Things you can verify by reading the code or running tests

## Fluent commands

Use `fluent --help` for the top-level surface and `fluent <command> --help` for a specific command's flags. Run `fluent cleanup` after terminal Work Items land or fail; `--apply` removes the terminal state.

During interactive stages, follow the stage references directly rather than calling these commands ad hoc. `references/plan-execution.md` is the one exception — it ends by running `fluent work-item create` as documented in its procedure.
