description: Create, review, or edit SuperDeck presentations and presentation apps. Use when working with `slides.md`, SuperDeck Markdown syntax, fullscreen slides, `@section`/`@block`/`@widget` layout, built-in widgets such as `@image`, `@dartpad`, `@webview`, and `@qrcode`, custom Flutter widgets, `DeckOptions`, `BlockVariant`, slide parts, templates, styles, images/assets, CLI builds, plugins, or validation of SuperDeck deck behavior. Use when this capability is needed.

# SuperDeck Presentations

## Overview

Use this skill to build accurate SuperDeck presentations: Markdown slide content, Flutter runtime wiring, assets, custom widgets, styling, templates, and verification.

## Reference Routing

Load only the reference needed for the task:

- Read `references/authoring.md` when creating or reviewing `slides.md`, block syntax, layouts, slide notes, built-in widgets, Markdown images, alerts, code, or hero markers.
- Read `references/runtime-customization.md` when wiring a Flutter app, registering custom widgets, configuring `DeckOptions`, slide parts, styles, templates, assets, or plugins.
- Read `references/verification.md` before claiming a deck/app works, when choosing commands, or when diagnosing build/render issues.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the existing `slides.md`, `lib/main.dart`, `pubspec.yaml`, and any registered widgets/parts/templates before editing.
2. Decide whether the task is authoring-only, runtime customization, plugin/build setup, or verification/debugging; load the matching reference.
3. Prefer the repository's documented syntax and implementation behavior over generic presentation assumptions.
4. Keep slides readable in Markdown: use frontmatter for metadata, `@section` for vertical rows, child blocks/widgets for horizontal columns, and `flex` ratios for sizing.
5. Verify with a real SuperDeck build or targeted tests before reporting success.

## Ground Truths

- SuperDeck renders a 1280x720 logical slide into a 16:9 scaled viewport.
- A slide contains vertical sections. Each `@section` starts a new vertical row; blocks inside that section are laid out horizontally.
- `@block` renders Markdown. `@widget` and any unrecognized `@name` render a `WidgetBlock`.
- Images have two authoring paths. Prefer standalone Markdown `![alt](src)` when the image belongs in the Markdown content flow; use `@image { src: ... }` when the image needs block-level layout control such as `fit`, fixed size, `flex`, `align`, `scrollable`, or `data:` source support.
- Markdown class markers such as `{.heading}` or `{.title}` drive Hero transitions for supported Markdown elements; the class does not need a `hero-` prefix. Use the same tag on matching elements across adjacent slides, and do not duplicate the same tag on one slide.
- `@column` is intentionally unsupported; use `@block`.
- Effective content alignment is `block align → section align → centerLeft`.
  Use section alignment as a shared default and child alignment for exceptions.
- `flex` is a positive integer. Section flex controls vertical height; child
  block flex controls horizontal width.
- Section `spacing` creates finite, non-negative gaps only between sibling
  blocks and affects horizontal space allocation. Block `margin` is consumed
  inside that block's allocated frame, outside its decoration/border — it
  reduces only that block's own usable area, never creates a shared gutter,
  and never changes flex ratios (unlike CSS margins; use section `spacing` for
  gutters). Block `padding` is consumed inside the decorated container,
  between the border and the content. Both accept scalar, symmetric, or
  physical-edge forms. Omitted object edges normalize to zero; explicit `null`
  edges are invalid. An absent override inherits the resolved style value for
  that inset; an explicit `0` removes it. A present override
  replaces only the matching inset after variants resolve while preserving
  other style data (decoration, clipping, animation).
- `SlideStyler.blockContainer` accepts `BlockStyler`, a constrained Mix styler
  supporting only `padding`, `margin`, `decoration`, `foregroundDecoration`,
  `clipBehavior`, context/`BlockVariant` variants, and animation. It cannot
  express widget modifiers, width/height/constraints, transforms, or box
  alignment; use `BoxStyler` for other style slots (`slideContainer`, code
  block containers, alert containers).
- `scrollable` is valid on `@block` and widget blocks, not on `@section`.
- `layout: fullscreen` removes resolved header/footer chrome while retaining the slide's resolved background and style. `normal` is the default.
- Built-ins `image`, `dartpad`, `webview`, and `qrcode` are always registered and can be overridden by user widgets with the same name.
- `@image scale` is a finite number greater than zero. It changes painting, not
  layout, and clips using the effective alignment and image/content frame.
- `@dartpad` and `@webview` use the same deck-scoped WebView controller cache. A `cacheKey` enables sequential reuse across remounts, never concurrent sharing by two live blocks.
- Custom widgets must be registered in `DeckOptions.widgets`; use shorthand `@widgetName { ... }` in `slides.md` for registered widget names.
- `BlockVariant('name')` is a Dart/Mix stylesheet selector for all `WidgetBlock`s with that exact, case-sensitive name. It affects the matching container and its widget subtree, not `@block` content.
- Styles, templates, widgets, slide parts, and plugins are configured in Dart through `DeckOptions`/`SuperDeckApp`, not through a separate `styles.yaml`.
- The CLI reads `slides.md`, writes `.superdeck/superdeck.json`, and ensures `.superdeck/` is listed in Flutter assets unless `--skip-pubspec` is used.
- `DeckOptions(debug: true)` diagnoses non-scrollable Markdown and custom
  widget overflow without changing Markdown wrapping or rebuilding content;
  static capture omits diagnostics.
