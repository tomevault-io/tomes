# Install Tobari

This skill helps install the tobari CLI tool for scoped coverage measurement in Go.

## Installation

Install the tobari CLI using the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/goccy/tobari/cmd/tobari@latest
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify that tobari is available:

```bash
tobari version
```

## Important Version Matching

The version of the tobari CLI tool and the tobari library used in your application must match.

For example, if you install `tobari@v0.2.1`, your `go.mod` should also require:
```
github.com/goccy/tobari v0.2.1
```

Version mismatch will cause fingerprint errors during linking.

## Basic Usage

After installation, you can run tests with tobari coverage:

```bash
GOFLAGS="$(tobari flags)" go test ./...
```

This will generate coverage data in `tobari/tobari.json` and `tobari/tobari.toon`.

### Specifying Output Directory

Use `TOBARI_COVERDIR` to specify where coverage data should be written:

```bash
TOBARI_COVERDIR=/path/to/output GOFLAGS="$(tobari flags)" go test ./...
```

## Next Steps

After running tests with tobari:
- Use `tobari-duplicated-tests-remover` skill to find and remove duplicate tests
- Use `tobari-coverage-improver` skill to improve test coverage incrementally
