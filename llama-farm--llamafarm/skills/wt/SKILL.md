# wt - Worktree Manager Skill

Manages isolated LlamaFarm development environments using git worktrees. Each worktree has its own services, ports, and data directories - enabling parallel agent sessions without conflicts.

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Create worktree and start services | `wt create feat/my-feature` |
| Create and cd into worktree | `wt create --go feat/my-feature` |
| List all worktrees with status | `wt list` |
| Check service health | `wt status` or `wt health` |
| Start/stop services | `wt start` / `wt stop` |
| View service logs | `wt logs [server\|rag\|runtime\|designer\|all]` |
| Delete worktree | `wt delete <name>` |
| Switch to worktree | `wt switch <name>` |
| Open Designer in browser | `wt open` |
| Diagnose issues | `wt doctor` |
| Clean orphaned data | `wt gc` |

## When to Use wt

Use `wt` when:
- Starting isolated work on a feature/task that needs running services
- Running parallel coding sessions (multiple agents or terminals)
- Testing changes without affecting the main development environment
- Avoiding port conflicts between concurrent LlamaFarm instances

---

## Common Workflows

### Starting a New Task

```bash
# Create isolated environment with services running
wt create --go feat/my-task

# Work in the worktree...
# Services are already running on auto-assigned ports

# Check status anytime
wt status

# View logs if needed
wt logs server
```

### Checking What's Running

```bash
# List all worktrees with their port assignments
wt list

# Example output:
# NAME              STATUS    SERVER   DESIGNER  RUNTIME
# feat-my-task      running   8150     5150      11150
# fix-bug           stopped   8234     5234      11234
```

### Cleaning Up

```bash
# Stop services and remove a worktree
wt delete feat-my-task

# Remove data for worktrees that no longer exist
wt gc

# Remove worktrees for branches merged to main
wt prune
```

### Troubleshooting

```bash
# Diagnose common issues (ports, stale PIDs, missing tools)
wt doctor

# Restart stuck services
wt stop && wt start

# Force delete if normal delete fails
wt delete my-worktree --force
```

---

## Service URLs

Each worktree gets unique ports. Check URLs with:

```bash
wt url
# Outputs:
#   Server:   http://localhost:8150
#   Designer: http://localhost:5150
#   Runtime:  http://localhost:11150
```

If the Caddy proxy is running, use port-free URLs:
```
http://server.feat-my-task.localhost
http://designer.feat-my-task.localhost
```

---

## Key Environment Details

- **Worktrees location**: `~/worktrees/llamafarm/`
- **Data directories**: `~/.llamafarm/worktrees/<name>/`
- **Port allocation**: Deterministic hash of worktree name (14345+offset, 5000+offset, 11000+offset)
- **Logs**: `~/.llamafarm/worktrees/<name>/logs/`

---

## Notes for the Agent

1. **Always use `wt create --go`** when setting up a new task environment - it handles everything (branch, deps, build, services)
2. **Check `wt list` first** before creating a new worktree to see what already exists
3. **Use `wt status`** to verify services are healthy before running tests or making API calls
4. **Run `wt doctor`** when encountering unexplained service issues
5. **Clean up with `wt delete`** when a task is complete to free resources
