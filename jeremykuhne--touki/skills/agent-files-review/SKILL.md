# Agent customization files - review checklist

Run through every applicable item below before approving a change to an agent
customization file. Each item below caught a real bug in PR review history.

This skill assumes the repository has adopted the agent-file scaffold: an
`AGENTS.md` single-source with a generated `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
mirror, a validator script (conventionally `tools/Validate-AgentFiles.ps1`), a
relative-link checker (conventionally `tools/Test-AgentFileLinks.ps1`), and a CI
workflow (conventionally `.github/workflows/agent-files.yml`) running markdownlint
plus an offline lychee link check. A consuming repo wires the exact paths in its
overlay.

## 1. AGENTS.md / `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

- The mirror is generated. **Never edit `.github/copilot-instructions.md` by hand.**
  Edits go in `AGENTS.md`, then regenerate the mirror with the validator's
  fix mode (`Validate-AgentFiles.ps1 -Fix`).
- Run the validator after any `AGENTS.md` edit. The agent-files CI workflow
  enforces this; out-of-sync mirrors fail CI.
- **Relative Markdown links must work in both `AGENTS.md` and the mirror.** The
  generator rewrites them automatically (`.github/x` → `x`, other paths get
  `../` prepended). Don't pre-rewrite links by hand. Don't add absolute
  filesystem paths or `./` prefixes that would defeat the regex.
- Don't use end-of-line comments in `AGENTS.md` examples or anywhere else; the
  file itself bans the pattern. Same applies to YAML examples in the README
  files for `.github/agents/`, `.github/prompts/`, etc. - put `# comment`
  lines above the field, not after it.
- Watch for placeholder syntax in code examples (e.g.
  `<see langword=".."/>`). Use a recognizable ellipsis (`"..."`) or a real
  example value.
- Run a grammar pass: singular vs. plural ("extension methods"),
  "for your needs" not "for your need", etc.

## 2. `*.instructions.md` (path-specific instructions)

- Frontmatter must include a non-empty `applyTo` glob.
- Glob is comma-separated, relative to repo root. Quote the value for safety.
- The validator only checks `applyTo`'s presence and emptiness; it does not
  verify that the glob actually matches anything. Sanity-check by eye.

## 3. `*.agent.md` (custom agents)

- Frontmatter must include `description`.
- If `tools` is present, it must be a YAML list. Either form is accepted by
  the validator:

  ```yaml
  tools: ['search', 'edit']
  ```

  ```yaml
  tools:
    - search
    - edit
  ```

- The repo's authoring rules forbid end-of-line comments; document optional
  fields with comment lines *above* them in any examples.

## 4. `SKILL.md` (`.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`)

- `name` is **required** and must:
  - match `^[a-z0-9-]{1,64}$`
  - equal the parent directory name exactly
- `description` is required; make it specific enough that another agent
  can decide when to load it.
- A name/dir mismatch causes the skill to silently fail to load. Always
  verify by running the validator.

## 5. `*.prompt.md` (reusable prompts)

- No required frontmatter, but `description` is recommended for the slash
  menu UX.

## 6. Validator and workflow

- The frontmatter parser in the validator script is typically hand-rolled. A
  hand-rolled parser supports flat scalars, inline lists, and block lists, but
  **not** nested mappings, multi-line strings, anchors, or flow mappings. If a
  contributor needs those, switch to a real YAML module (e.g.
  `powershell-yaml`) rather than extending the regex.
- The mirror generator preserves `AGENTS.md`'s on-disk line endings (LF or
  CRLF) so `core.autocrlf=true` doesn't cause spurious diffs on Windows
  checkouts.
- The markdownlint config typically disables MD013 (line-length), MD022/MD032
  (blanks-around), MD033 (inline HTML), MD041 (first-line heading), and keeps
  MD040 (fenced-code-language), no-trailing-spaces, no-hard-tabs. Don't disable
  MD040 - adding a `text` language tag is trivial and prevents drift.
- The CI job typically runs on `ubuntu-latest`. PowerShell is preinstalled
  there; no `pip` step is needed.

## 7. Relative Markdown links must resolve in this branch

The CI link check is **offline lychee** - it only follows links that
resolve to files in the current working tree. A link to a file that exists
on the canonical repo's `main` but not in your branch will fail.

- **Before opening a PR with agent-file changes, run the link checker.**
  Without arguments, it scans every Markdown file in CI's lychee scope and
  reports any relative link whose target doesn't exist on disk. It typically
  auto-detects the PR base ref: `upstream/main` if a remote literally named
  `upstream` exists (the fork-PR workflow, where `origin` is your fork and
  `upstream` is the canonical repo), `origin/main` otherwise (working directly
  on a clone of the canonical repo). A changed-only mode and an explicit
  base-ref override are the usual options.
- **If you cite files added by a different in-flight or just-merged PR,
  rebase your branch on the canonical `main`** (`upstream/main` from a
  fork, or `origin/main` from a direct clone) so those files exist
  locally. A recurring review-round loss comes from exactly this scenario:
  the branch predated a sister PR that added the referenced source files,
  so every cross-reference to them failed lychee even though those files
  existed on the canonical `main`.
- The lychee check runs against the merged tree on `main` only after a
  push, so a stale branch can still ship broken links into your PR. Treat
  rebase-then-link-audit as a single step before pushing any agent-file
  change that references code added elsewhere.
- Don't downgrade a real link to backticks just to silence the checker.
  Either fix the link or rebase. Backtick references work as a last resort
  when the file truly does not exist in any branch yet.

## 8. Whitespace (applies to every file in scope)

- No trailing whitespace.
- No whitespace-only lines (a "blank" line must be truly empty).
- Tabs are forbidden in Markdown bodies.
- **Files must end with a single newline character** (markdownlint MD047).
  The validator flags a *missing* trailing newline (it checks the file ends
  with `\n`, not that there is exactly one); markdownlint enforces the full
  single-newline rule in CI. New files
  created via the standard editor tooling get this for free, but
  hand-edited or copy-pasted content sometimes loses the final `\n`.
- These rules are enforced both by the validator and by markdownlint.

## How to run the checks locally

**Always run the validator before declaring a review complete or pushing
agent-file changes.** It catches mirror drift, missing/invalid frontmatter,
`SKILL.md` naming mistakes, missing trailing newlines, and trailing/empty-line
whitespace - the same rules CI enforces. Run it in plain mode to validate, and
in fix mode (`-Fix`) to regenerate the mirror after editing `AGENTS.md`.

The validator does **not** reproduce markdownlint's full rule set. After it
passes, sanity-check that your Markdown:

- ends with exactly one newline (MD047);
- has a language tag on every fenced code block, e.g. \`\`\`text or \`\`\`yaml
  (MD040);
- doesn't use tabs (no-hard-tabs).

If CI fails after a local validator pass, the failure is almost always
markdownlint (open the failing job's annotations) or the lychee link check
(broken relative link - remember the mirror rewrites links, so test
the form in `AGENTS.md`, not the rewritten copy).
