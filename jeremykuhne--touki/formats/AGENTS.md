## Project overview

`touki` is a C# library that targets both **.NET 10** and **.NET Framework 4.7.2**.
All code must compile and behave correctly on both targets.

Top-level layout:

- `touki/` - main library
- `touki.tests/` - xUnit tests (uses FluentAssertions; access to internals via `InternalsVisibleTo`)
- `touki.testsupport/` - shared test helpers (`TestAccessor`, etc.)
- `touki.perf/` - BenchmarkDotNet performance projects
- `sample/` - usage samples
- `docs/` - contributor and design documentation

## Environment setup

- On Unix, run `./setup.sh` once after cloning to install the .NET 10 SDK and update PATH.
- On Windows, install the .NET SDK from <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download> and use
  `dotnet` directly. PowerShell is the preferred terminal.
- Use the `dotnet` CLI for building and testing. CI runs `dotnet build` and `dotnet test`.

## Coding style

- Use the latest C# features (C# 14) where applicable.
- Always use C# keywords for types (`int`, `string`, `bool`) instead of their aliases
  (`Int32`, `String`, `Boolean`).
- Always use `nint` and `nuint` for native integer types (not `IntPtr` and `UIntPtr`).
- Avoid `var` - use explicit type declarations, target-typed `new`, and
  [collection expressions](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/collection-expressions)
  together: `List<string> list = new();`, `int[] values = [1, 2, 3];`,
  `Point[] points = [new(1, 2), new(5, 6)];`. The variable's type is always
  spelled out; the `new`/`[]` literal supplies the value.
- Use `is null` and `is not null` for null checks instead of `== null` or `!= null`.
- For enums wrapped in `Value`, always call `Value.Create()` instead of `new Value()`.
- Use the following header for all C# files:

```c#
// Copyright (c) 2025 Jeremy W Kuhne
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
// See LICENSE file in the project root for full license information
```

## Comments and XML documentation

- Avoid putting comments at the end of lines.
- Comments should be before the code they describe, or inside blocks to describe the
  condition the block is handling.
- Create XML comment documentation for all public methods, properties, and types.
- Use `<para>` blocks in `<remarks>` to separate different sections of remarks.
- Indent XML comments by one space for each level of nesting:

```c#
/// <summary>
///  This is the summary.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///  <para>
///   This is a remark.
///  </para>
/// </remarks>
```

- Use `<inheritdoc/>` and `<inheritdoc cref="..."/>` to inherit documentation from base
  classes and interfaces where applicable.
- For method overloads, use `<inheritdoc cref="MethodName"/>` to inherit documentation
  from the method with the most arguments, overriding tags where they differ.
- Use `<see langword="..."/>` tags for language keywords in comments
  (e.g. `<see langword="true"/>` instead of `true`).
- Prefer plain ASCII characters that don't need escaping (`-`, `"`, `...`,
  `->`) over typographic Unicode (`—`, `–`, `"`, `"`, `…`, `→`) or HTML
  entities (`&mdash;`, `&ndash;`, `&hellip;`, `&rarr;`, `&nbsp;`). Use a
  plain `-` (with surrounding spaces when separating clauses) instead of
  em/en-dashes. Only escape when the raw character would actually be
  parsed as markup (e.g. `<` inside an XML doc comment); do not escape
  defensively when it isn't needed. Exact vendored payloads are exempt: fix
  generic punctuation upstream and re-vendor rather than editing a pinned core.

## Line breaks and whitespace

- Never put multiple statements on a single line.
- Ensure there is always a single blank line between methods and properties.
- Preserve existing spaces and line breaks when making edits, except when fixing
  whitespace issues.
- Indents are 4 spaces for all code except for XML (including XML comments in sources),
  which should have nested tags and content indented by one space per level.
- Lines should never end in or contain only spaces or tabs.
- Lines should be broken before 120 characters if they would otherwise exceed 150
  characters.
- When breaking statements, the next lines should be indented.
- When breaking statements, operators (`+`, `-`, `&&`, `||`, `or`, `and`) should not be
  at the end of the previous line, except for `=>`.
- When breaking lines in a method call, all parameters should be indented on their own
  lines.
- After multiple edits to a file, verify that blank lines and whitespace remain correct.
- When using search-and-replace tools, include 3-5 lines of context before and
  after the target text.

## Testing

Detailed test conventions live in
[.github/instructions/tests.instructions.md](instructions/tests.instructions.md)
(applies to `touki.tests/**/*.cs`). Headline rules: place tests in `touki.tests`;
name them `MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior`; use FluentAssertions (global
using); access internals directly via `InternalsVisibleTo` and private members via
`TestAccessor`; ref structs can't be used in lambdas - use `try`/`finally`.

Performance-test conventions for `touki.perf/` (BenchmarkDotNet, Release-only,
JIT-naming rule, regression thresholds) live in
[.github/instructions/perf.instructions.md](instructions/perf.instructions.md).

## Working with the user on changes

Three hard requirements, all violated on this repo before:

1. **Never create or rewrite a commit without explicit user approval.**
2. **Never push without explicit user approval.**
3. **Never create a pull request without explicit user approval.**

Editing, committing, pushing, and pull-request operations are separate approval
boundaries. A request to implement or fix something authorizes edits only. Leave
completed changes pending and unstaged for review unless the user explicitly asks
to stage them.

### Pre-flight before any commit, push, or PR tool

Re-read the **most recent user message verbatim** before crossing each boundary.

- Creating or rewriting a commit requires an explicit commit instruction in that
  message: `commit`, `commit these changes`, `make the commit`, `commit and push`,
  or an unambiguous equivalent that names creating a commit.
- Pushing requires an explicit push instruction in that message: `push`,
  `commit and push`, `ship it`, `send it`, or an equivalent.
- Creating, editing, merging, or closing a PR requires an explicit instruction
  for that PR action: `open the PR`, `create the PR`, `make the PR`, `edit the
  PR`, `merge the PR`, `close the PR`, or an equivalent.
- Approval for one boundary does not imply approval for another. In particular,
  commit approval does not authorize a push; push approval does not authorize a
  commit or PR action; and a PR request does not authorize a prerequisite commit
  or push.

If the message does not authorize the exact boundary, **stop and ask one short
yes/no question.**

Tools and commands that count as **commit or history rewrite** (require commit
approval):

- Terminal: `git commit` (including `--amend`), `git reset`, `git merge`,
  `git cherry-pick`, `git revert`, and `git rebase`.
- Any tool that creates or rewrites a local commit, even if it does not invoke
  `git commit` by name.

Tools that count as **push** (require approval):

- Terminal: `git push` (incl. `--force`, `--force-with-lease`).
- MCP / in-process: `mcp_io_github_git_push_files`,
  `mcp_io_github_git_update_pull_request_branch`.

Create feature branches locally with `git checkout -b`; that's not a push.

Tools that count as **PR create / edit / merge / close** (require
approval):

- Terminal: `gh pr create|edit|merge|close`.
- MCP / in-process: `mcp_io_github_git_create_pull_request`,
  `mcp_io_github_git_update_pull_request`,
  `mcp_io_github_git_create_pull_request_with_copilot`,
  `mcp_io_github_git_merge_pull_request`,
  `github-pull-request_create_pull_request`.

### Phrasings with limited or no approval

These have all been interpreted too broadly on this repo:

- "address the review comments" / "fix the comments" / "look at the
  comments" - edit-only.
- "do the next step" / "let's do X next" / a bare "go ahead" attached
  to a task description - selects which task, not whether to publish.
- "fix the CI failure" / "the PR is failing" - diagnosis or local
  fix, not a push.
- "pull main and work on X" - authorizes the work only.
- "looks good" / "that works" - feedback, not permission to commit.
- "push it" / "ship it" / "open the PR" when changes are still pending -
  approval only for the named action, not permission to create a prerequisite
  commit or perform another boundary action.

When in doubt, ask one short yes/no question.

### Workflow

1. **Work on a feature branch.** If `git branch --show-current` reports
   `main`, create a topic branch first (`git checkout -b <name>`). Never
   commit to `main`. If you're handed a commit-in-progress on `main`,
   stop and ask. Default to rebasing the branch on the current
   `origin/main` (`git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main`)
   before the first push, unless the user says otherwise.
2. Edit.
3. Validate (`dotnet build`, `dotnet test -c Release`).
4. Leave the changes pending and unstaged. Describe the change and show or
  summarize the diff, then **stop** for review.
5. **On explicit commit approval**, stage by path and create only the approved
  commit. Commit approval does not authorize a push.
6. **On explicit push approval**, push only the approved commits. Push approval
  does not authorize a PR operation.
7. **On explicit PR-operation approval**, perform only the named PR action. If
  the branch needs an unapproved commit or push first, stop and ask.

### After a violation

Acknowledge directly without minimizing. If an unauthorized local commit is the
current unpushed `HEAD`, verify that fact, then ask for explicit approval before
uncommitting that revision while preserving its changes in the working tree.
Never erase the changes. If the commit was pushed or is not the current `HEAD`,
stop and let the user decide whether to revert, rewrite, or leave it. **Do not
create or push a follow-up "fix" commit without explicit approval** - that
compounds the failure.

### Other rules

- **Stage by path, never `git add -A`/`git add .`** when the working
  tree spans more than one logical change. Run `git status --short`
  first; if topics are intermingled, ask how to split.
- **Run `dotnet test -c Release` before declaring a fix done.**
  Release-mode inlining surfaces bugs Debug doesn't - `Unsafe.As`
  on a method parameter is a known foot-gun on net481 RyuJIT.

### Enforcement

**The user may be running VS Code Copilot in Bypass Approvals mode**
(`chat.permissions.default` = `"autoApprove"` at the user level), or in
Autopilot, or with `chat.tools.global.autoApprove` enabled. The agent
cannot tell from inside a session which mode is active. **Assume the
mechanical backstops below may be disabled** and self-enforce the rule
above on every commit and publishing tool. The agent's pre-flight check is the
only guard that works in every configuration.

- **Terminal (VS Code Copilot agent mode).** [.vscode/settings.json](../.vscode/settings.json)
  contains a denylist (`chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove` with `false`
  entries) for `git commit`, `git push`, `git reset`, `git rebase`,
  `git merge`, `git cherry-pick`, `git revert`, `git tag`, destructive
  `git branch -d/-D`, and `gh pr create|merge|close|edit`. In Default
  Approvals mode each denied command requires an in-chat **Allow** click.
  That click is defense-in-depth only; it does not replace the explicit
  commit or publishing instruction required in the latest user message.
  **In Bypass Approvals or Autopilot, this denylist is
  ignored at runtime** - the entries remain as documentation of
  which commands cross a commit or publish boundary, and as a defense-in-depth
  tripwire for contributors and agents who *are* in Default Approvals
  mode. Do not rely on the denylist to stop you.
- **MCP and in-process tools are NOT covered by
  `terminal.autoApprove` in any mode.** The chat tool surface has its
  own per-tool approval flow which Bypass Approvals and Autopilot
  also disable. **Do not invoke any GitHub write tool**
  (`mcp_io_github_git_create_pull_request`,
  `mcp_io_github_git_update_pull_request`,
  `mcp_io_github_git_merge_pull_request`,
  `mcp_io_github_git_push_files`,
  `mcp_io_github_git_create_or_update_file`,
  `mcp_io_github_git_delete_file`,
  `mcp_io_github_git_update_pull_request_branch`,
  `github-pull-request_create_pull_request`, etc.) without an explicit
  publishing verb from the user in the most recent message.
- **Branch protection on `main`** (PR required, status checks required,
  force pushes and branch deletion blocked) is the only server-side
  guard that survives every approval mode. It does not stop
  `gh pr create|merge|close|edit`, MCP `create_pull_request`,
  `merge_pull_request`, or pushes to feature branches - only
  direct writes to `main` itself.

The agent's pre-flight check (re-read the user's most recent message
verbatim and confirm it authorizes the exact commit or publishing boundary)
is load-bearing. If the message does not contain that authorization, stop and
ask one short yes/no question. Do not assume the user "obviously" wants the
change committed or published, and do not assume an approval prompt will
appear to catch a mistake.

## General guidance

- Ensure code is cross-compatible with both .NET 10 and .NET Framework 4.7.2.
- Check `GlobalUsings.cs` for global usings and don't add unnecessary usings.
- **Prefer `Touki.EnumExtensions` over hand-written enum bitwise code** in
  production library code. `AreFlagsSet`, `AreAnyFlagsSet`,
  `IsOnlyOneFlagSet`, `SetFlags`, `ClearFlags` inline to the same
  instructions as `&`/`|`/`==` on both TFMs and avoid the `Enum.HasFlag`
  boxing penalty on net472/net481 (~20x faster, zero alloc).
- **When optimizing span-walking helpers**, read the
  [`framework-jit-optimization`](../.agents/skills/framework-jit-optimization/SKILL.md)
  skill and its bundled
  [references/framework-span-performance.md](../.agents/skills/framework-jit-optimization/references/framework-span-performance.md)
  first. The headline rule: on net472/net481 hoist
  `ref T = MemoryMarshal.GetReference(span)` out of the loop and walk with
  `Unsafe.Add<T>(ref, i)` for a 19-44% Framework win at no `unsafe`-keyword cost,
  and prefer one simple implementation unless net10 regresses measurably.
- **Prefer Touki utility types over their BCL counterparts** when building
  strings, buffers, or collections in production library code. They are
  designed to avoid managed allocation on the hot path:
  - `Touki.Text.ValueStringBuilder` instead of `System.Text.StringBuilder`.
    Always seed it with a stack buffer (`stackalloc char[256]` is the
    standard size); it rents from `ArrayPool<byte>` automatically if the
    content outgrows the buffer. It is `[MustDispose]`: declare it with
    `using` and read the result with `ToString()`, or - when the builder is
    mutated via `ref`/`Length`, which a `using` variable forbids - call
    `ToString()` then `Dispose()` explicitly. Verified savings of
    58-63% allocated bytes when replacing `StringBuilder` in the
    `GlobMatcherFactory` bytecode encoder, with no measurable throughput
    cost.
  - `Touki.Text.StringSegment` / `Touki.Text.StringSpan` instead of
    substring allocation when slicing existing strings.
  - `Touki.Buffers.*` (rented arrays, span helpers) before reaching for raw
    `new char[]` / `new byte[]` in scratch code.
  - `Touki.Collections.*` (`ContiguousList`, `ArrayPoolList`,
    `SingleOptimizedList`, `EmptyList`) instead of `List<T>` /
    `Dictionary<,>` when the lifetime is bounded.
- **When choosing how a hot path gets a short-lived scratch buffer** (zeroed
  `stackalloc` vs `[SkipLocalsInit]` + `stackalloc` vs `BufferScope<T>` vs an
  `ArrayPool<T>.Shared` rental), follow the
  [`scratch-buffer-strategy`](../.agents/skills/scratch-buffer-strategy/SKILL.md)
  skill for the decision tree and the net481/net10 size crossovers, backed by
  its bundled
  [references/arraypool-performance.md](../.agents/skills/scratch-buffer-strategy/references/arraypool-performance.md).
- When adding a polyfill for a modern .NET API on .NET Framework, follow the
  [`polyfill-dotnet-api`](../.agents/skills/polyfill-dotnet-api/SKILL.md) skill:
  prefer Microsoft-shipped packages, then PolySharp source-gen for compiler
  attributes, and only hand-roll under
  `touki/Framework/Polyfills/<BclNamespace>/` as a last resort. See
  [references/polyfill-layout.md](../.agents/skills/polyfill-dotnet-api/references/polyfill-layout.md)
  for the layout rules (namespace = BCL namespace; Touki-specific code stays
  under `touki/Framework/Touki/...`) and the `extern alias` recipe.

## Agent customization changes

After editing agent files, run `pwsh tools/Validate-AgentFiles.ps1`,
`pwsh tools/Validate-AgentSkills.ps1`, and `pwsh tools/Test-AgentFileLinks.ps1`.

## Path-specific instructions

Additional rules apply to specific file types and live under
[.github/instructions/](instructions/). Tools that support the
`*.instructions.md` format (Copilot cloud agent, code review, CLI, VS Code, and
Visual Studio) load them automatically based on each file's `applyTo` glob.

Currently:

- [.github/instructions/msbuild.instructions.md](instructions/msbuild.instructions.md) - rules for `*.csproj`, `*.props`, `*.targets`.
- [.github/instructions/tests.instructions.md](instructions/tests.instructions.md) - conventions for `touki.tests/**/*.cs`.
- [.github/instructions/perf.instructions.md](instructions/perf.instructions.md) - BenchmarkDotNet conventions and the JIT-naming rule for `touki.perf/**/*.cs`.
- [.github/instructions/polyfills.instructions.md](instructions/polyfills.instructions.md) - the two non-negotiable rules for `touki/Framework/Polyfills/**/*.cs`.
