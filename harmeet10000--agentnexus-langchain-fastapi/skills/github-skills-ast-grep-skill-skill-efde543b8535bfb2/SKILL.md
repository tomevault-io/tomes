name: ast-grep-skill
description: Structural code search, linting, and rewriting using AST-level pattern matching. Use when users need to search code by syntax structure (not text), write custom lint rules, perform codemods across a codebase, replace regex grep for precise AST-aware queries, or create reusable lint rule sets. Covers CLI usage, pattern syntax, rule system (atomic/relational/composite/utility), lint rule authoring, rewrite/transform, project setup, and testing. Use when this capability is needed.

# ast-grep

## Overview

ast-grep searches and transforms code using AST patterns instead of text regex. Think `grep` × `eslint` × `codemod` — but polyglot, with a single pattern language across 20+ languages via tree-sitter.

Powered by Rust. Handles 10k+ files in seconds. Supports search, lint, rewrite, and programmatic API usage.

### Supported Languages

| Domain | Languages |
|--------|-----------|
| System | C, C++, Rust |
| Server | Go, Java, Python, C# |
| Web | JS(X), TS(X), HTML, CSS |
| Mobile | Kotlin, Swift |
| Config | JSON, YAML, HCL |
| Scripting | Lua, Nix |

### First Search

```bash
# Find all console.log calls
ast-grep -p 'console.log($$$)' -l ts

# Find with rewite
ast-grep -p '$PROP && $PROP()' -r '$PROP?.()' -l ts

# Interactive mode
ast-grep -p 'var $NAME = $VAL' -r 'const $NAME = $VAL' --interactive
```

> Always single-quote patterns to prevent shell expansion of `$`.
