# Deploy Checklist — the fence between staging and prod

Run this checklist before any deploy. The production deploy itself is
gated by a human approval step enforced in `protocols/permissions.md`.

## Pre-deploy checks
- [ ] All tests passing locally and in CI.
- [ ] No unresolved TODOs or FIXMEs in the diff.
- [ ] Migrations are reversible, or an explicit rollback plan is documented.
- [ ] Env vars for new features are set in the target environment.
- [ ] Feature flags default to off for anything user-visible.
- [ ] Changelog or release notes updated.

## Staging deploy
- Deploy. Watch logs for 5 minutes. Click through the new flow in a real browser.
- If anything looks off, roll back and investigate. Do not push through.

## Production deploy
- This step *requires* human approval. The agent must ask, not assume.
- Deploy during a low-traffic window when possible.
- Watch error rate and latency dashboards for 15 minutes post-deploy.
- Be ready to rollback in one command; have the rollback command pre-typed.

## Post-deploy
- Log the deploy (version, time, who approved) to episodic memory with
  `importance: 8`.
- If anything went wrong, run the debug-investigator loop and update
  this checklist with the new step that would have caught it.

## Self-rewrite hook
After any rollback, this checklist is missing a step. Add it.
