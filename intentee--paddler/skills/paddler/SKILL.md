# Running all tests

Run every test suite in the workspace, picking the fastest compiled device backend for the host. 

## Step 1: detect the device

Run this once at the start and echo the chosen device:

```bash
if [[ "$OSTYPE" == "darwin"* ]]; then
  DEVICE=metal
elif command -v nvidia-smi >/dev/null 2>&1 && nvidia-smi >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  DEVICE=cuda
else
  DEVICE=cpu
fi
echo "Device: $DEVICE"
```

`$DEVICE` selects the Rust integration suite variant in Step 2. The other four suites don't take a device feature.

## Step 2: run the suites

Copy this checklist and tick each item as the suite completes:

```
- [ ] JS client
- [ ] Python client
- [ ] Rust unit
- [ ] Rust integration
```

| # | Suite            | Inner command                                                                                                                     | Working dir              |
|---|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | JS client        | `make test.client.js`                                                                                                             | repo root                |
| 2 | Python client    | NixOS: `poetry run pytest`, `ruff`, `poetry run mypy"`. Every other OS: `poetry run pytest`, `poetry run ruff`, `poetry run mypy` | `paddler_client_python/` |
| 3 | Rust unit        | `TEST_DEVICE=$DEVICE make test.unit`                                                                                              | repo root                |
| 4 | Rust integration | `TEST_DEVICE=$DEVICE make test.integration`                                                                                       | repo root                |

Run them in this order. Cheap suites (1, 3, 4) surface bugs quickly; the heavy GPU-bound suites (2, 5) come last.

## Step 3: rules during the run

- **Serialize GPU suites.** When `$DEVICE` is `cuda` or `metal`, run test suites sequentially to avoid device contention.
- **Per-test 30 s budget.** Flag any individual test that exceeds 30 s wall-clock. That is a real bug — production or test — not flakiness.

## Step 4: report

After all suites finish, sum up the results in an actionable report.
