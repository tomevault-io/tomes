# EasySlides Academic PPTX

EasySlides is a repository-backed Codex plugin. This skill is a thin adapter
around the canonical operating guide at `../../SKILL.md`; read that file
completely before executing a presentation task.

## Required startup reading

From the plugin/repository root, read:

1. `SKILL.md`, the complete route and execution contract.
2. `ARCHITECTURE.md`, the layer model and supported capability paths.
3. `workflows/routing.md`, deterministic route selection for the request.
4. `skills/easyslides-clarify/SKILL.md`, the blocking user-choice gate.

Run the clarification gate before selecting a route whenever the request is
ambiguous. Then read the specific workflow selected by the routing guide. For
a source PPTX that should become a reusable template, invoke the plugin-local
`skills/easyslides-distill/SKILL.md` first, followed by the PPTX, template-reuse, and
template-spec guidance selected by `workflows/pptx-to-easyslides-template.md`.
Do not invent a second PPTX export backend: use the existing SVG/shape IR to
DrawingML/PPTX pipeline or the documented native PPTX route.

The plugin-local skills are authoritative. Treat separately installed legacy
skills such as `ppt-distill`, `easyppt`, or `easyslides-template-reuse` as
compatibility references only; do not let them replace this canonical route or
reintroduce source-slide-order filling.

## Mandatory production-scheme choice

The default intake is an adaptive native-popup conversation. Ask one meaningful
question, use its answer to choose the next, and skip already explicit facts.
Do not open a browser guide or require a form unless the user explicitly asks.
When the brief is executable, summarize it and proceed without repeated approval.

For academic content, read `references/academic-orchestration.md` before intake.
Inspect supplied material contents and roles; establish research permission,
audience, intended outcome, speaking time, visual preference and preservation
boundaries. Its evidence and storytelling workflow applies to every template
and production scheme, subject to the requested editing scope.

Before making a new or regenerated PPT, MUST ask which production scheme to use
unless the user already explicitly selected one for this task. Wait for the
answer; do not silently pick a route from the input format, a template, imagegen,
or a general request for editability. No automatic default.
Use the exact three-option question in `workflows/clarification-gate.md`.
This is required even when the rest of the request is unambiguous.

## Mandatory reconstruction-mode choice

In both choice rounds, MUST show Token 消耗 and 耗时 levels for every option
before the user chooses. Explain that levels are relative estimates adjusted for
scope and complexity, not exact usage or promised time; disclose image generation
separately. Follow the cost and time disclosure in the clarification workflow.

For image reconstruction, confirm 全图矢量重建 (`full_vector`) or 保留复杂配图
(`preserve_complex_images`) through `workflows/clarification-gate.md` before
execution. No automatic default, even for “快点做”; reuse only an explicit choice
in the same task. Both modes require native PPT text boxes. Preserve one source
line in one text box, merging OCR fragments and using text runs for mixed styling;
keep independent labels and table cells separate. Full-vector mode needs approval
before any raster exception. Partial rebuilds apply this within selected regions.
When a source region is identified as tabular, declare it as `native_table` in
the inventory and mark its SVG handoff with `data-pptx-table="true"`; the
exporter emits a real PowerPoint table with measured rows, columns, cells and
merge metadata.

## Chinese wording defaults

For complete ImageGen slides, use the reference-image payload, recorded result,
and generation-manifest handoff in `workflows/slide-image-to-editable-pptx.md`.
An existing image file alone is insufficient proof of generation. Each approved
image is the visual source for its reconstructed page. Never substitute another
template shell. Require `delivery_ready=true` plus actual source/render review.

Default to “垂听”, not “聆听”, in authored Chinese PPT text, including closings
such as “感谢垂听，敬请讨论”. Apply this preference to imagegen prompts and
editable slide text alike; see the full rule in `../../SKILL.md`.

## Runtime conventions

- Run commands from the plugin/repository root.
- Use `python scripts/easyslides.py --help` to discover the command hub.
- Keep generated projects and private source material under the existing
  ignored project/output locations.
- Preserve the existing templates, references, workflows, and QA gates.
- Never place API keys, tokens, or private source material in committed files.

## Common command entry points

```powershell
python scripts/easyslides.py --help
python scripts/easyslides.py clarify --help
python scripts/easyslides.py project --help
python scripts/easyslides.py source-to-md --help
python scripts/easyslides.py distill --help
python scripts/easyslides.py semantic-render --help
python scripts/easyslides.py template-gate --help
python scripts/easyslides.py review --help
python scripts/easyslides.py workflow --help
```

For PPTX-to-template work, use the same command hub:

```powershell
python scripts/easyslides.py distill "path\to\source.pptx" --template-id my_template
```

Before selecting a cover, TOC, transition, or ending variant from a
`functional_page_variants.json` registry, run the named-slot geometry gate:

```powershell
python scripts/functional_page_variant_adapter.py <template_dir> --role toc --check-all
```

This gate is fail-closed. It rejects variants whose editable text slots
overlap or whose same slot id occupies multiple independent text boxes, because
those defects otherwise become duplicated or mutually obscured text in the
native PPTX export. Repair the SVG geometry or choose another variant before
rendering content.

The plugin is intentionally lightweight: the repository remains the runtime,
template library, and source of truth. Add a dedicated MCP server only after a
stable command contract is demonstrated by the existing CLI and tests.
