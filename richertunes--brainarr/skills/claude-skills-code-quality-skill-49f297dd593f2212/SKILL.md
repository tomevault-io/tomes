# Code Quality Enforcer

## Current Quality Infrastructure
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: Collected with Coverlet (31% baseline)
- ✅ **Mutation Testing**: Stryker.NET weekly runs
- ✅ **Code Formatting**: .NET format enforcement in CI
- ✅ **Static Analysis**: .NET analyzers enabled
- ✅ **Pre-commit Hooks**: Format and lint checks

## Expertise Areas

### 1. Coverage Enforcement
- Set minimum coverage thresholds
- Fail builds on coverage regression
- Track coverage trends over time
- Identify uncovered critical paths

### 2. Mutation Testing
- Validate test effectiveness with Stryker.NET
- Identify weak tests that pass but don't validate logic
- Improve test quality through mutation analysis
- Weekly automated mutation test runs

### 3. Static Analysis
- CodeQL security scanning
- .NET analyzers and Roslyn
- Custom analyzer rules
- Complexity metrics tracking

### 4. Code Formatting
- Consistent style with .NET format
- EditorConfig enforcement
- Pre-commit format validation
- CI format verification

### 5. Quality Gates
- Fail builds on quality regression
- Enforce coverage thresholds
- Block PRs with quality issues
- Quality trend dashboards

## Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Increase Coverage**: From 31% baseline to 50%+
2. **SonarCloud Integration**: Code smells and tech debt
3. **Complexity Metrics**: Track cyclomatic complexity
4. **Performance Regression**: Detect performance degradation
5. **Quality Dashboards**: Visualize quality trends

## Related Skills

- `integration-testing` - Quality through testing

## Examples

### Example 1: Enforce Coverage Threshold
**User**: "Fail builds if coverage drops below 31%"
**Action**: Add coverage enforcement to test workflow, fail on regression

### Example 2: Run Mutation Tests
**User**: "Run Stryker mutation testing"
**Action**: Execute Stryker, review mutation score, identify weak tests, improve coverage

### Example 3: Quality Dashboard
**User**: "Create quality metrics dashboard"
**Action**: Integrate CodeCov, add badges to README, visualize trends
