## Review Checklist

1. **Correctness** — Logic errors, off-by-ones, edge cases, wrong assumptions
2. **Bugs** — Null/None handling, uninitialized variables, race conditions
3. **Types & shapes** — Tensor dtype/device mismatches, shape errors, implicit casts
4. **Security** — Injection, hardcoded secrets, unsafe deserialization
5. **Style** — Naming, dead code, unnecessary complexity, consistency with surrounding code
6. **Performance** — Unnecessary copies, repeated computation, memory leaks

## Output Format

For each issue found:
- **File and line**: where the issue is
- **Severity**: critical / warning / nit
- **What**: one-line description
- **Why**: brief explanation
