# Test and Fix the Connector

## Goal
Validate the generated connector for **{{source_name}}** by executing the provided test suite, diagnosing failures, and applying minimal, targeted fixes until all tests pass.

## 0. Rules
- **Write tests first, then run.** Do NOT run exploratory scripts (e.g. `python -c "..."`, `which python`, import checks) before the test file exists. Read the implementation source and reference test — that is sufficient.
- **Run pytest synchronously** — never in background. Do not use `sleep`, poll loops, `ps aux | grep pytest`, `wc -l`, or `tail` on output files. Run `pytest ...` directly and block until it completes.
- Only run standalone scripts to isolate a specific failing HTTP call *after* pytest has already failed and pointed to the problem.

## 1. Setup Test Files
Create a `test_{source_name}_lakeflow_connect.py` under the `tests/unit/sources/{source_name}/` directory.
**Always follow `tests/unit/sources/example/test_example_lakeflow_connect.py` as the primary example** — it shows the correct pattern: load both `dev_config.json` and `dev_table_config.json`, pass `table_config` and a small `sample_records` (e.g. 5) to `LakeflowConnectTester`.

### Partitioned Connector Tests
If the connector implements `SupportsPartition` or `SupportsPartitionedStream` (check the connector class definition for these mixins), the test class **must** also inherit from `SupportsPartitionedStreamTests` alongside `LakeflowConnectTests`. This adds partition-specific test coverage (partition key validation, partitioned reads, micro-batch convergence, etc.).

## 2. Test Configuration (Credentials & Bounds)
Use the configuration files in `tests/unit/sources/{source_name}/configs/` to initialize your tests. Do **not** mock data; tests must connect to an actual instance.

### A. Authentication (`dev_config.json`)
If `dev_config.json` does not exist, create it and ask the developers to provide the required parameters to connect to a test instance of the source.
Example:
```json
{
  "user": "YOUR_USER_NAME",
  "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD",
  "token": "YOUR_TOKEN"
}
```

### B. Table Options (`dev_table_config.json`)
If it does not exist, create `dev_table_config.json` and supply the necessary `table_options` parameters for testing different cases.

**CRITICAL: Control query scope and batch size (do this automatically):** 
Tests often run against large data volume accounts. To avoid hangs and ensure tests complete quickly, you **must** constrain both the query scope and the batch size:
- **Query Scoping**: If the connector uses a sliding window or server-side limit (e.g., `window_seconds` or `limit`), inspect the connector implementation and add these options to `dev_table_config.json` with very small values (e.g., `window_seconds`: "60", `limit`: "5"). This ensures the query itself is bounded and prevents the API from scanning the entire dataset.
- **Admission Control**: Always find the option that controls the per-microbatch record limit (usually `max_records_per_batch`) and add it to `dev_table_config.json` with a small value (e.g., "5"). This makes the call return faster and avoids accumulating too many records.

Do **not** wait for the user to provide these — read the connector source code, identify the relevant option names, and configure them yourself.

*Note: Be sure to remove these config files after testing is complete and before committing any changes.*

## 3. Execution
Run the tests using the project virtual environment (Python 3.10+ required):
```bash
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/unit/sources/{source_name}/test_{source_name}_lakeflow_connect.py -v
```

## 4. Fix Failures
Based on test failures, update the implementation under `src/databricks/labs/community_connector/sources/{source_name}` as needed. Use both the test results and the source API documentation, as well as any relevant libraries and test code, to guide your corrections.

## Debugging Hangs and Slow Tests

Tests that hang (no output, no error) are almost always an API call that never returns. Systematic approach:

1. **Enable debug logging** to see where it stalls:
```bash
pytest tests/unit/sources/{source_name}/test_{source_name}_lakeflow_connect.py -v -s --log-cli-level=DEBUG
```
If `urllib3` logs `Starting new HTTPS connection` with no response line, the HTTP call itself is hanging.

2. **Isolate the HTTP call** — reproduce the exact request (same URL, headers, params) in a standalone script. If that also hangs, the problem is the query parameters, not the connector logic.

3. **Narrow down by elimination** — remove or change one query parameter at a time. Common culprits: unbounded history scans (`date_range=all`), ascending sort on large datasets, missing date-range filters.

4. **Start with the most constrained query** — small `limit`, narrow time window, status filters. Once it works, progressively relax to find the boundary.

5. **Check for missing timeouts** — every `requests.get()`/`session.get()` must have a `timeout` parameter. Without it, a slow API hangs forever with no error. For testing, set a short timeout (e.g., 10 seconds) so failed requests surface quickly instead of blocking for minutes.

6. **Timeout means the query bound is too wide** — if a request times out, do NOT increase the timeout. Instead, halve the window or limit in `dev_table_config.json` and retry. Keep halving until the request succeeds. For example: start at `window_hours=1`, then try `0.5` (30 min), `0.25` (15 min), etc. The right fix is always a tighter query, not a longer wait.

6. **Suspect large-account behavior** — test credentials may connect to an account with millions of records. If queries time out:
   - First, check if the connector already has `table_options` (like `window_seconds`, `limit`, or `max_records_per_batch`) and ensure they are set to very small values in your `dev_table_config.json`.
   - If the connector lacks these mechanisms, add server-side date filtering or switch to the sliding time-window pattern (see implement-connector SKILL) to constrain the query.

## Merge files
After completion, run `python tools/scripts/merge_python_source.py {source_name}` to re-generate the merged connector file `_generated_{source_name}_python_source.py`.
