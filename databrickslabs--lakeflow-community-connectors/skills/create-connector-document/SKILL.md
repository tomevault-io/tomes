# Create Public Connector Documentation

## Goal
Generate the **public-facing documentation** for the **{{source_name}}** connector, targeted at end users.

## Output Contract
Produce a Markdown file strictly following the standard template at `templates/community_connector_doc_template.md` as `src/databricks/labs/community_connector/sources/{{source_name}}/README.md`.

## Documentation Requirements

- Please use the code implementation as the source of truth.
- Use the source API documentation to cover anything missing.
- Always include a section about how to configure the parameters needed to connect to the source system.
- AVOID mentioning internal implementation terms such as function or argument names from the `LakeflowConnect`.
