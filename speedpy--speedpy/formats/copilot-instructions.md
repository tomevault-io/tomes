# AGENTS.md

This file is the source of truth for AI Coding Agents working in this repository.
`CLAUDE.md` and `.cursorrules` exist only as pointers to this file — keep guidance here.

## Additional case-specific instructions

Read the matching file **before** you start, if your task is one of these. They
live outside this file so that a capability most projects never touch does not
cost every reader the tokens to scroll past it.

- video manipulation, transcoding, compression, video upload, ffmpeg: `agents_docs/working_with_video_files.md`
- hosted remote MCP, MCP endpoint, MCP connector, OAuth for AI agents, streamable HTTP, mcp.<domain>, RFC 8707 audience, CIMD: `agents_docs/working_with_hosted_mcp.md`

Adding one: keep the file in `agents_docs/`, name it for the task rather than the
technology (`working_with_<thing>.md`), and add exactly one bullet here —
searchable words first, path last. Anything a project would only sometimes need
belongs there, not in this file.

## Project Overview

SpeedPy Standard is a Django-based web application starter template featuring a single-app architecture with custom
user authentication, Celery for background tasks, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The project supports two development
modes — Docker Compose or local uv + npm — picked at init time.

## Development Commands

For mode-specific run commands (Django management, Tailwind, migrations, tests, shell access, etc.) read
**`AGENTS-local.md`** in this directory. It is populated by `init-docker.sh` or `init-local.sh` and reflects the
active setup. Do not assume a particular wrapper (`docker compose run` vs `uv run`) — the cheat sheet is the source
of truth for invocation.

Initialization scripts:

- `bash init-docker.sh` — boots the project with Docker Compose (Postgres, Redis, Celery, nginx media).
- `bash init-local.sh` — runs the project on the host with uv + npm, SQLite, no Redis, Celery in always-eager mode.

## Architecture

### Apps Structure (single-app architecture)

This is a **single-app Django project**. All business logic ships from `mainapp`.
**Do not create a new Django app** for a new feature, page, or model — extend `mainapp`.
The only existing apps and their narrow purposes:

- **`mainapp`** — every piece of business logic, every page, every URL that is not user
  auth and not the boilerplate demo. New models, views, forms, admin, Celery tasks,
  templates all go here. Uses **package-style modules** (one file per concern, re-exported
  through `__init__.py`):
    - `mainapp/models/<group>.py` — re-export the class in `mainapp/models/__init__.py`
      and add it to `__all__`
    - `mainapp/views/<group>.py` — re-export in `mainapp/views/__init__.py` `__all__`
      (class-based views only)
    - `mainapp/forms/<group>.py` — re-export in `mainapp/forms/__init__.py` `__all__`
    - `mainapp/admin/<group>.py` — re-export in `mainapp/admin/__init__.py`
    - `mainapp/tasks/<group>.py` — Celery tasks, re-export in `mainapp/tasks/__init__.py`
    - URL routes in `mainapp/urls.py`
    - Templates in `templates/mainapp/<group>/...`
- **`usermodel`** — custom email-based `User` model and anything that mutates that model
  or its profile (avatar, OTP profile fields owned by the user, allauth adapter,
  signup/login/profile forms). Uses **single-file modules** (`models.py`, `views.py`,
  `forms.py`, `admin.py`, `managers.py`, `adapters.py`) — keep that shape; do not
  package-split it. Anything user-adjacent that is really business logic (e.g. a Team a
  user belongs to, a per-user setting that's part of a feature) belongs in `mainapp`,
  not here.
- **`demoapp`** — read-only reference for boilerplate users. The Product CRUD at
  `/demo/products/` is the canonical example to copy when building new CRUD screens.
  **Do not add real product features here.** If you need to extend the demo to teach a
  new pattern, keep it conventional: `demoapp/models.py`, `demoapp/forms.py`,
  `demoapp/views.py`, `demoapp/urls.py`, templates under `templates/demoapp/`.
- **`speedpycom`** — framework-level utilities shared by every app: `BaseModel` (UUID
  pk + timestamps — inherit it for new models), management commands like
  `generate_tailwind_directories`, default OG image view. Add cross-cutting helpers
  here, not feature code.

DRF (`rest_framework`) and `drf-spectacular` are installed for versioned integration
endpoints under `/api/v1/`. New JSON integration endpoints follow the HTTP API guide
below; do not add DRF to server-rendered HTML views. The primary UI remains
Django templates + crispy forms + Alpine.js. Ad-hoc `JsonResponse`s in
`mainapp/views/` are only for tiny UI helpers (tours, toggles).

### Key Architectural Patterns

- Class-based views preferred over function-based views
- Foreign key references use string notation: `'mainapp.ModelName'`
- New concrete models inherit from `speedpycom.models.BaseModel` (UUID primary key + created/updated timestamps)
- Templates live in the **root `templates/` directory**, namespaced by app:
  `templates/mainapp/`, `templates/demoapp/`, `templates/account/` (allauth overrides
  and user/profile pages owned by `usermodel`), `templates/components/` (reusable
  partials), `templates/partials/`, `templates/emails/`.
  No per-app `templates/` directories.
- Package-style organization for `mainapp` (models, views, forms, admin, tasks);
  single-file modules for `usermodel`, `demoapp`, `speedpycom`

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django 6.1.1 with PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.0 with Alpine.js
- **Authentication**: django-allauth with custom email-based user model
- **Background Tasks**: Celery with Redis
- **Deployment**: Docker with Docker Compose

### Database Configuration

- Supports PostgreSQL (recommended), SQLite (development), and MySQL
- Database collation automatically configured per engine
- Uses django-environ for environment variable management

### Styling and Static Files

- Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
- SpeedPy UI design system (see below) — do NOT introduce Flowbite, DaisyUI, or other component libraries
- Static files served via WhiteNoise
- CSS compiled from `static/mainapp/input.css` to `static/mainapp/styles.css`

## SpeedPy UI Design System

The project uses an in-house design system called **SpeedPy UI**. A live catalogue of every
primitive lives at `/speedpyui-preview/` — open it before designing new pages or components
to see what's already available and reuse the existing look.

### Before you build new UI — check what already exists

Do not hand-roll a new component, CRUD screen, or layout if a reference already exists.
In order, check:

1. **`/speedpyui-preview/`** (rendered from `templates/mainapp/speedpyui_preview.html`) —
   buttons, inputs, cards, badges, alerts, tables, pagination, breadcrumbs, chips,
   timeline, stepper, accordion, etc. with copyable markup. If a primitive is here, use
   the exact classes from the preview — do not redefine them.
2. **`/speedpyui-preview/FormView`** + `mainapp/forms/speedpyui_preview.py` — canonical
   crispy-forms `FormView` styled with SpeedPy UI. Copy this shape for any new form.
3. **`demoapp` Product CRUD** (`/demo/products/`) — canonical full CRUD example. When
   adding `ListView` / `CreateView` / `UpdateView` / `DetailView` / `DeleteView` for a
   new model, mirror the structure of `demoapp/views.py`, `demoapp/forms.py`,
   `demoapp/urls.py`, and the four templates under `templates/demoapp/`
   (`product_list.html`, `product_form.html`, `product_detail.html`,
   `product_confirm_delete.html`). Pagination, search/filter, empty state, and the
   "Generate demo products" empty-table seed action are all already wired correctly there.
4. **Reusable template partials** — include or extend instead of copy-pasting markup:
    - `templates/base.html` — base page; extend for any public/authenticated page
    - `templates/mainapp/layouts/dashboard.html` — dashboard chrome
    - `templates/mainapp/layouts/sidebar_layout.html` — sidebar + content layout
    - `templates/account/base_manage.html` — account/settings pages with left nav
    - `templates/components/nav.html`, `nav_auth.html`, `footer.html`,
      `messages.html`, `checkmark.html` — site-wide chrome
    - `templates/components/sidebar_layout/` — `sidebar_menu.html`,
      `user_menu.html`, `crud_navigation.html`
    - `templates/components/team_selector/team_dropdown_selector.html`
    - `templates/partials/_tour.html` — Driver.js tour wiring (only renders when
      `tour_steps` is non-empty)

If something close-but-not-identical exists, **extend or parameterize the existing
partial/template**; do not fork a near-duplicate. If genuinely nothing exists, add the
new component as a `@layer components` class in `static/mainapp/input.css`, document it
in `/speedpyui-preview/`, and only then use it in pages — that keeps the design system
the single source of truth.

### Design tokens (colors, surfaces, shadows)

Colors and surfaces are declared as CSS variables in `static/mainapp/input.css` and wired into
Tailwind via `tailwind.config.js`. They automatically swap between light and dark mode, so in
templates you write **one** utility name per slot — never pair a light utility with a `dark:`
variant for token-driven colors.

Use these Tailwind utilities (bound to the tokens):

- Background: `bg-background` (app chrome), `bg-background-paper` (cards, modals, raised surfaces)
- Text: `text-fg` (primary), `text-fg-secondary` (muted / helper text)
- Borders: `border-divider`
- Brand / status: `bg-primary`, `text-primary`, `bg-secondary`, `bg-success`, `bg-info`,
  `bg-warning`, `bg-error` — each has `-light`, `-dark`, and `-contrast` variants
  (e.g. `text-primary-contrast` for text placed on a `bg-primary` surface)
- Numbered brand scale (`bg-primary-50` … `bg-primary-900`) exists for backwards compatibility
  but prefer the token-driven `primary` / `primary-dark` / `primary-light` names
- Neutrals `neutral-50`…`neutral-950` are static (same value in both modes) — use them only
  for things that must NOT follow the theme
- Elevation: `shadow-speedpyui-1 | -3 | -8 | -12 | -16 | -24` (use `-16` for cards, `-24`
  for modals). Do not add raw `shadow-lg` / `shadow-md` — they look off against the palette.

**Do not** write `bg-white`, `bg-gray-*`, `text-gray-*`, `text-black` for surfaces or
body/heading copy. Those bypass the theme and will not follow dark mode. The only exceptions
are utility text like `text-primary-contrast` on brand-filled buttons, or `neutral-*` where
a deliberately static color is needed.

### Dark mode

- Tailwind is configured with `darkMode: 'class'` and the `.dark` class is toggled on
  `<html>` by the inline script at the top of `templates/base.html`.
- User preference is stored in `localStorage['theme-preference']` with values
  `'light' | 'dark' | 'auto'` (default `'auto'` follows `prefers-color-scheme`). The nav bar
  includes a three-state theme toggle (`#theme-toggle`) wired in `static/mainapp/index.js`.
- Because colors come from CSS variables, **most new markup does not need `dark:` variants**.
  Only add `dark:` prefixes for things the token system doesn't cover (e.g. legacy
  `neutral-*` scales on third-party widgets).

### Component classes

Re-use these `@layer components` classes from `input.css` rather than hand-rolling new styles:

Open `/speedpyui-preview/` before adding or changing UI — it shows rendered examples and
copyable snippets for every SpeedPy UI primitive. (See "Before you build new UI" above for
the full reuse checklist.)

When extending the `demoapp` itself (teaching examples only — real features go in
`mainapp`), keep its single-file shape: model in `demoapp/models.py`, form in
`demoapp/forms.py`, generic class-based views in `demoapp/views.py`, routes in
`demoapp/urls.py`, and templates under `templates/demoapp/`. **Do not seed demo rows in
migrations** — expose an explicit POST action like the Product "Generate demo products"
button, and only show it when the demo table is empty.

**Buttons** — compose three axes: variant + color + size. Size defaults to `btn-md`.

```html
<button class="btn btn-contained btn-primary">Save</button>
<button class="btn btn-outlined btn-error btn-sm">Delete</button>
<a href="..." class="btn btn-text btn-secondary btn-lg">Learn more</a>
```

- Variants: `btn-contained` (filled), `btn-outlined` (border only), `btn-text` (ghost)
- Colors: `btn-primary`, `btn-secondary`, `btn-success`, `btn-info`, `btn-warning`,
  `btn-error`, `btn-inherit`
- Sizes: `btn-sm`, `btn-md` (default), `btn-lg`

**Form inputs** — `input-outlined`, `textarea-outlined`, `select-outlined`, `checkbox`,
`radio`, `switch` (with `.switch-track` and `.switch-thumb`). Pair with
`.form-field`, `.input-label`, `.input-helper`, `.input-error`, `.input-error-text` for
layout. `crispy-tailwind` field templates already emit these classes, so crispy forms pick
them up automatically. Use `/speedpyui-preview/FormView` as the canonical working example
of a Django `FormView` styled by crispy forms.

**Typography and page layout** — use these for regular page structure instead of repeating
long wrapper and heading utilities:

```html
<main class="section">
  <div class="page-container">
    <div class="section-header">
      <p class="eyebrow">Overview</p>
      <h1 class="h1">Dashboard</h1>
      <p class="lead">Summary text.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</main>
```

- Layout: `section`, `section-paper`, `page-container`, `page-header`, `section-header`
- Page headers with top-level actions must use the action layout:
  `page-header-actions` with `page-header-main` for copy and `page-header-buttons` for
  actions. Top-level action buttons (Add, Create, Delete, Generate, etc.) belong on the
  right on desktop, never centered under the title.
- Typography: `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `eyebrow`, `lead`
- Icons and avatars: `media-icon`, `avatar-sm`, `avatar-xs`

**Cards, status, lists, and tables** — use these for dashboard panels, account pages, status
rows, and simple data display. Keep preview/documentation examples one component per row:

```html
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-header"><h2 class="h3">Title</h2></div>
  <div class="card-body">Content</div>
  <div class="card-footer">Actions</div>
</div>

<span class="badge badge-success">Verified</span>
<div class="alert alert-warning">Review this setting.</div>
```

- Cards: `card`, `card-header`, `card-body`, `card-footer`
- Lists: `list-group`, `list-group-item`
- Badges: `badge`, `badge-lg`, `badge-primary`, `badge-secondary`, `badge-success`,
  `badge-info`, `badge-warning`, `badge-error`
- Alerts: `alert`, `alert-primary`, `alert-secondary`, `alert-success`, `alert-info`,
  `alert-warning`, `alert-error`, `alert-danger`, `alert-light`, `alert-neutral`.
  **`.alert` is a flex row** (`@apply flex …`), so every direct child is a flex item.
  Put the whole message in ONE `<span>` whenever it mixes text with an inline
  element — a bare text node and a sibling `<a>`/`<strong>` become two anonymous
  flex items and the whitespace between them is dropped, rendering
  "records is paused.Update billing.":

  ```django
  {# wrong — the spaces around the link disappear #}
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
      Payment is past due. <a href="…" class="underline">Update billing</a>.
  </div>

  {# right — one flex item #}
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
      <span>Payment is past due. <a href="…" class="underline">Update billing</a>.</span>
  </div>
  ```

  Deliberate multi-item alerts (icon + text, message + copy button) are fine —
  that is what the flex row is for; add `items-center gap-2` and, for the text
  half, still wrap it in its own `<span>`.
- Tables: `table`, `table-hover`, `table-striped`, `table-sm`
- Pagination: use `pagination`, `pagination-summary`, `pagination-list`,
  `pagination-link`, `pagination-link-active`, `pagination-link-disabled`, and
  `pagination-ellipsis` for list footers. Prefer numbered, elided pagination with a
  result count summary over Previous/Next-only controls.
- Dividers: `divider`, `divider-text`, `divider-vertical`
- Generic surfaces: `paper`, `paper-outlined`, `paper-padded`, `paper-elevation-0`,
  `paper-elevation-1`, `paper-elevation-3`, `paper-elevation-8`, `paper-elevation-16`,
  `paper-elevation-24`
- Chips: `chip`, `chip-sm`, `chip-primary`, `chip-secondary`, `chip-success`,
  `chip-info`, `chip-warning`, `chip-error`, `chip-outlined`, `chip-avatar`,
  `chip-remove`
- Breadcrumbs: `breadcrumbs`, `breadcrumb-list`, `breadcrumb-item`, `breadcrumb-link`,
  `breadcrumb-current`
- Button groups: `btn-group`, `btn-group-vertical`; use existing `btn` variants inside
- Skeletons: `skeleton`, `skeleton-text`, `skeleton-text-lg`, `skeleton-circular`,
  `skeleton-rectangular`
- Linear progress: `progress`, `progress-sm`, `progress-lg`, `progress-xl`,
  `progress-bar`, `progress-primary`, `progress-secondary`, `progress-success`,
  `progress-info`, `progress-warning`, `progress-error`
- Timeline: `timeline`, `timeline-item`, `timeline-marker`, `timeline-marker-success`,
  `timeline-marker-info`, `timeline-marker-warning`, `timeline-marker-error`,
  `timeline-content`, `timeline-title`, `timeline-meta`, `timeline-body`
- Stepper: `stepper`, `step`, `step-marker`, `step-body`, `step-label`,
  `step-description`, `step-completed`, `step-active`, `step-link`
- Accordion: `accordion`, `accordion-item`, `accordion-header`, `accordion-body`; use
  native `<details>` / `<summary>` unless custom behavior is explicitly needed

**Account and sidebar navigation** — use these for settings pages and dashboard sidebar
links rather than repeating link classes:

```html
<a href="..." class="account-nav-link account-nav-link-active">Profile</a>
<a href="..." class="sidebar-link sidebar-link-active">
  <svg class="sidebar-link-icon">...</svg>
  Dashboard
</a>
```

- Account: `account-shell`, `account-nav`, `account-nav-link`, `account-nav-link-active`
- Top nav: `top-nav`, `top-nav-inner`, `top-nav-brand`, `top-nav-logo`,
  `top-nav-title`, `top-nav-actions`, `top-nav-menu`, `top-nav-list`,
  `top-nav-item`, `top-nav-link`, `top-nav-icon-button`, `top-nav-user-button`,
  `top-nav-auth-link`, `top-nav-dropdown`, `top-nav-dropdown-header`,
  `top-nav-dropdown-link`
- Sidebar: `sidebar`, `sidebar-brand`, `sidebar-brand-text`, `sidebar-section-label`,
  `sidebar-nav`, `sidebar-link`, `sidebar-link-active`, `sidebar-link-icon`,
  `sidebar-divider`, `sidebar-select`, `sidebar-dropdown`, `sidebar-dropdown-item`,
  `sidebar-dropdown-item-active`

### Alpine.js conventions

Alpine 3.15.x is loaded via `templates/base.html`. A few gotchas we hit the hard way:

- **Do not reuse the variable name `open` across nested `x-data` scopes.** The nav wrapper
  in `templates/components/nav.html` declares `x-data="{open: false}"` for the mobile menu;
  nested scopes (user menu dropdown, etc.) must pick a different name — e.g.
  `userMenuOpen`, `sidebarOpen`. Reusing `open` shadows the outer scope and causes reads and
  writes to resolve against different proxies, leaving the dropdown permanently hidden.
- **Do not add `x-transition` to the user menu dropdown** (or any dropdown that starts with
  `display:none`). In this bundle the inline-style transition gets stuck at opacity 0 and the
  element never becomes visible. Toggle visibility with `x-show` + `x-cloak` only; if you
  need a fade, use explicit `x-transition:enter-*` / `x-transition:leave-*` class directives
  with CSS classes, not the bare `x-transition` shortcut.
- **Do not toggle `hidden` on `.top-nav-menu`.** The desktop navigation is shown by the
  component class via `lg:flex`; adding a runtime `hidden` class after Alpine initializes
  can override it and make the links disappear on desktop. Keep `.top-nav-menu` hidden by
  default in CSS and use `:class="open ? '!flex' : ''"` for the mobile-open state.
- Use `x-model` on the hidden checkbox inside a `.switch` to bind a boolean state. See
  `templates/mainapp/pricing.html` for the monthly / yearly toggle example
  (`x-model="yearly"`, `x-text="yearly ? '$801' : '$89'"`).

### User profile pictures

The custom user model (`usermodel.models.User`) has two image fields:

- `profile_picture` — full upload (`ImageField`, stored under `media/profile_pictures/`)
- `profile_picture_thumbnail` — 96×96 thumbnail auto-generated on save (stored under
  `media/profile_pictures/thumbnails/`), used in nav avatars

Render avatars with the three-tier fallback used in `templates/components/nav_auth.html`
and `templates/components/sidebar_layout/user_menu.html`:

```django
{% if user.profile_picture_thumbnail %}
    <img src="{{ user.profile_picture_thumbnail.url }}" class="w-8 h-8 rounded-full object-cover" …>
{% elif user.profile_picture %}
    <img src="{{ user.profile_picture.url }}" class="w-8 h-8 rounded-full object-cover" …>
{% else %}
    <span class="w-8 h-8 rounded-full bg-gray-600 text-white flex items-center justify-center text-xs font-semibold">
        {{ user.first_name|slice:":1"|upper }}{{ user.last_name|slice:":1"|upper }}
    </span>
{% endif %}
```

Profile editing lives at `/accounts/profile/` (`ProfileEditView` +
`templates/account/profile/edit.html`). The form MUST use `enctype="multipart/form-data"`
because `UserProfileForm` exposes `profile_picture`. Dev media is served via the
`if settings.DEBUG: urlpatterns += static(...)` block at the bottom of `project/urls.py`.

### Sidebar navigation

The authenticated app shell is `templates/mainapp/layouts/sidebar_layout.html`. It renders
the left sidebar through its `sidebar_menu` block, which by default includes
`templates/components/sidebar_layout/sidebar_menu.html`. Any page that extends the layout
gets the sidebar for free.

**Where to add your app's nav links.** Put them in
`templates/components/sidebar_layout/crud_navigation.html`. It ships empty and is included
inside the General `<ul class="sidebar-nav">`, right after the Dashboard link — it is the
designated insertion point so you never have to touch `sidebar_menu.html` itself. Add `<li>`
items using the shared classes:

```django
<li>
    <a href="{% url 'your_view' %}"
       class="sidebar-link {% if request.resolver_match.url_name == 'your_view' %}sidebar-link-active{% endif %}">
        <svg class="sidebar-link-icon" …></svg>
        <span>Your Page</span>
    </a>
</li>
```

Drive the active state off `request.resolver_match.url_name` (not a hardcoded class) because
the same sidebar renders on every page.

**Team-scoped links (read this before adding any link).** Whether a link should be
team-scoped depends on `SPEEDPY_TEAMS_ENABLED`:

- The personal dashboard route is `name="dashboard"` (`/dashboard/`, `DashboardView`). When
  teams are **enabled** it is **not a page** — it redirects to the user's first team
  dashboard (`team_dashboard`), or to `team_create` if they have no team. It only renders
  `templates/mainapp/dashboard/main.html` when teams are **disabled**. So **never link
  directly to `{% url 'dashboard' %}` for navigation when teams may be enabled** — link to
  the team-scoped view instead.
- `get_default_team_for_user(user)` (in `mainapp.models`) is the single source of truth for
  "the user's default team" — the first active team with non-expired access. Both the
  `dashboard` redirect and the sidebar use it; reuse it, never reimplement the lookup.
- `SIDEBAR_TEAM` is injected into **every** template by the
  `project.context_processors.sidebar_team` context processor (it is `None` when teams are
  disabled or the user has none). Use it to build team-scoped sidebar links without a view
  change. On a team page the view also puts the current `team` in context — prefer `team`
  when present, fall back to `SIDEBAR_TEAM`:

```django
{% if SPEEDPY_TEAMS_ENABLED %}
    {% if team %}
        {% url "your_team_view" team_id=team.id as href %}
    {% elif SIDEBAR_TEAM %}
        {% url "your_team_view" team_id=SIDEBAR_TEAM.id as href %}
    {% else %}
        {% url "team_create" as href %}
    {% endif %}
{% else %}
    {% url "your_non_team_view" as href %}
{% endif %}
<a href="{{ href }}" class="sidebar-link …">…</a>
```

The Dashboard link in both `sidebar_menu.html` and `base_manage.html` already follows this
pattern — copy it. Team routes (`team_dashboard`, `team_create`, …) are only registered when
`SPEEDPY_TEAMS_ENABLED`, so always guard their `{% url %}` calls behind the
`{% if SPEEDPY_TEAMS_ENABLED %}` branch to avoid `NoReverseMatch`.

### Account / settings pages

Account pages (change password, email addresses, OTP settings, profile edit) extend
`templates/account/base_manage.html`, which reuses the sidebar layout above and overrides
the `sidebar_menu` block with the account-settings nav (Your Profile, Change Password, …).
New account pages should reuse this base, render their body in the `settings_content` block,
and follow the header style from `templates/account/password_change.html` (`<h2>` with the
shared classes) so the pages line up visually. To add an account link, edit the nav list in
`base_manage.html`; its Dashboard link follows the same teams behaviour described above.

### Tours (Driver.js)

`templates/partials/_tour.html` wires Driver.js with SpeedPy-themed popovers (overrides in
the `.driver-popover*` block at the bottom of `input.css`). Tours are only rendered when
the context contains non-empty `tour_steps`. Guard new tour styles outside `@layer
components` because Tailwind would otherwise purge them (the class names live in vendor JS,
not in the `content` globs).

## Code Conventions

For where each kind of file lives, see the **"Where new code goes — quick reference"**
table above. The conventions below cover *how* to write each kind, not *where* to put it.

### Models

- Inherit from `speedpycom.models.BaseModel` for new concrete models (gives a UUID
  primary key and `created_at` / `updated_at` timestamps)
- Use string references for foreign keys: `ForeignKey('mainapp.ModelName')`
- After adding a model in `mainapp/models/<group>.py`, re-export it in
  `mainapp/models/__init__.py` and append to `__all__`
- Add a matching admin in `mainapp/admin/<group>.py` and re-export it from
  `mainapp/admin/__init__.py`

### Views

- Class-based views only (inherit from Django's generic views; function-based views
  only for trivial endpoints like `mark_tour_complete`)
- After adding a view in `mainapp/views/<group>.py`, re-export it in
  `mainapp/views/__init__.py` and append to `__all__`
- Wire the URL in `mainapp/urls.py` (or `project/urls.py` only for project-level routes)
- For new CRUD screens, copy the structure of `demoapp/views.py` rather than rolling
  your own list/filter/pagination logic

### Admin

- Use meaningful `list_display`, `search_fields`, and filters
- Use `raw_id_fields` for foreign keys to large tables

### Performance

- Use `select_related()` and `prefetch_related()` for query optimization
- Implement caching with Redis backend
- Use Celery for long-running or I/O-bound operations

### Sending emails

Sending emails is performed with django-post_office library.

If a new email sending is needed to be perfomed then use the following structure:

```python

context = {
    'team_name': membership.team.name,
    'old_role': old_role,
    'new_role': new_role,
    'team_url': f"{settings.SITE_URL}/teams/{membership.team.id}/dashboard/",
}
subject = f"Your role in {membership.team.name} has changed"
html_message = render_to_string("emails/team_role_changed.html", context=context)
mail.send(
    membership.user.email,
    settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL,
    html_message=html_message,
    subject=subject,
    priority='now',
)

```

Don't use the post_office template attribute, but instead use django's render_to_template to prepare the email message.

New email templates must be placed into `templates/emails/` folder.

### Logging

For logging we use `structlog`.

Example usage:

```python
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger(__name__)


def something(user_id: int, something_else: str):
    logger.info("Something happened", user_id=user_id, something_else=something_else)
```

## Forms

In Django forms always use djago crispy forms layout in the `__init__` form and ` {% crispy form %}` to render the form.

For groups of fields that should be collapsed use `crispy_tailwind.layout.Collapse`.

For example:

```python
# forms.py

from django import forms
from django.conf import settings
from crispy_forms.helper import FormHelper
from crispy_forms.layout import Layout, Field, HTML, Div
from crispy_tailwind.layout import Submit, Collapse
import json

from mainapp.models import HTTPMonitor


class HttpMonitorForm(forms.ModelForm):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.helper = FormHelper()
        self.helper.form_tag = False

        self.helper.layout = Layout(
            # Basic Information
            HTML(
                '<div class="mb-6"><h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-2">Basic Information</h3></div>'),
            Field('name'),
            Field('url'),
            Div(
                Div(Field('method'), css_class='w-1/2 pr-2'),
                Div(Field('check_interval'), css_class='w-1/2 pl-2'),
                css_class='flex'
            ),
            Div(
                Div(Field('is_active'), css_class='mr-4'),
                css_class='flex items-center space-x-4 my-4'
            ),
            Div(
                Div(Field('is_paused'), css_class=''),
                css_class='flex items-center space-x-4 my-4'
            ),

            # Response Validation (Collapsible)
            Collapse(
                "Response Validation",
                HTML(
                    '<p class="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">Define what a successful response looks like</p>'),
                Field('expected_status_codes'),
                HTML(
                    '<p class="text-xs text-gray-500">Comma-separated list, e.g., 200, 201, 202. Defaults to 200.</p>'),
                Field('expected_content'),
            ),
        )

```

## Dependency vulnerabilities

```bash
manage.py audit_dependencies                  # what is in the lockfile
manage.py audit_dependencies --fail-on high   # for CI
```

Checks `uv.lock` against **OSV.dev**, whose query API is public. Three reasons it
exists rather than "read the Dependabot tab":

- **No credentials**, so it runs in CI, on a laptop, or from an agent with no
  GitHub token.
- It prints the **fixed-in version** per advisory, which is the part you need in
  order to act, and which the alert list does not give you.
- It reads the **lockfile**, so it audits what will be installed rather than what
  the version range permits.

**It refuses to report a clean bill when it cannot reach the database.** A command
that printed "no known vulnerabilities" during a network outage would launder the
outage into reassurance, so that path is a `CommandError`.

**Read the package names, not just the severity labels.** OSV reports what the
upstream database says, and the ranking that matters is exposure: HIGH in a
library that only ever sees your own input matters less than MODERATE in the one
that decodes images an anonymous visitor uploaded. When this was first run against
this repo it found nine vulnerable packages, and the most urgent was **Pillow** —
four HIGH advisories in the one library fed directly by public uploads — not the
package with the longest advisory list.

This is a **public template**. Anybody who starts a project from it inherits the
lockfile, so an untriaged advisory here is not the same kind of debt it would be
in a private app.

## Email addresses: blocklists and deliverability

**Every self-service door that takes an email address calls the same
validator:** signup, adding an address to an existing account, team invitations,
public forms, CSV imports. Not the operator doors — the Django admin can set
`User.email` and `EmailAddress` rows directly, and `EmailView.dispatch` syncs
`User.email` into `EmailAddress` unchecked on the next visit — and not allauth
headless, which builds on `AddEmailForm` directly and ignores `ACCOUNT_FORMS`;
wire the validator yourself if you enable it. It used to live inline in
`usermodel/forms.py`, which meant it covered signup and nothing else — a strange
place to draw the line, because signup was never the only door.

```python
from speedpycom.services import email_deliverability

email_deliverability.validate(email)          # raises ValidationError
verdict = email_deliverability.check(email)   # never raises, inspect .outcome
```

**Why it matters more than it looks.** SES tracks a bounce rate per account and
suspends sending above roughly 5%. So a handful of undeliverable addresses
collected through a public form can cost the ability to send *any* mail —
including password resets to paying customers. Refusing a typo while the person
is still looking at the form is the cheapest possible moment to catch it.

Rules, each of which was a defect in the inline version:

- **Cached per DOMAIN.** A lookup per submission is fine; a lookup per CSV row is
  not. Five thousand gmail addresses cost one question. Positive answers cache
  for a day, negative for an hour — a domain that just fixed its DNS should not
  stay refused all day.
- **Fails OPEN on a non-answer.** Timeout, SERVFAIL, no resolver: we learned
  nothing, so we refuse nobody. `NXDOMAIN` and `NoAnswer` are different — those
  *are* answers and they say no. Getting this backwards turns one broken
  resolver into a signup outage.
- **2s timeout**, not the inline version's 5s. This runs on public forms now.
- **MX-only by default.** RFC 5321's implicit-MX rule means an A-record-only
  domain is technically deliverable, so strict MX-only refuses a few valid ones.
  Accepted on purpose: a bounce costs reputation, the strict default costs a
  support message. `EMAIL_MX_ALLOW_IMPLICIT_MX` turns the fallback on.
- **Blocklists first**, because they are set lookups against data already in
  memory and there is no reason to pay for DNS to reject mailinator.com. They are
  enforced even when the DNS half is switched off: a blocklist is a policy, not a
  probe.
- **Two messages, and do not merge them.** A blocklist refusal must not say
  "check for typos" — that tells somebody probing the filter that their domain is
  fine and the problem is elsewhere.
- **On the signup form the verdict waits for the CAPTCHA — when reCAPTCHA is
  configured.** Django runs every field cleaner and shows every field error, so a
  `clean_email` check answered "is this domain blocked?" to anyone with no token
  — one domain per request rebuilds the whole list. The check runs from `clean()`
  and only when `usermodel/forms.py::captcha_passed(self)`; do not move it back
  into a field cleaner. The gate closes the oracle only where **both** reCAPTCHA
  keys are set (as in production): with no keys there is no CAPTCHA field,
  `captcha_passed()` is `True`, and the verdict is given as before — that is the
  intended behaviour on a keyless checkout, which has no bot protection to gate
  behind anyway. (The hosted collection page and public API have the same shape
  of leak with no CAPTCHA to gate behind even when keys are set — a separate,
  open product decision.)

**It does NOT catch a typo with a valid MX.** `gmail.co` resolves perfectly well.
Suggesting a correction for near-misses is a separate idea.

**Off during tests** (`_RUNNING_TESTS` in settings), because a real DNS call in a
test suite is a flaky-test factory. A test that wants it uses
`@override_settings(EMAIL_DELIVERABILITY_CHECK=True)` and mocks
`dns.resolver.resolve`.

## CAPTCHA

Two different jobs, two different tools. Do not use one for the other.

**Auth forms** (signup, login, password reset) use `django-recaptcha`'s form
field via `usermodel/forms.py::attach_recaptcha`. A login either passes or it
does not, so a field that raises a validation error is exactly right. On the
**signup** form the email blocklist / deliverability check is deliberately held
until the CAPTCHA passes (see the deliverability section's gate rule), so the
page cannot answer "is this domain blocked?" to a caller who never passed it.

**Public, unauthenticated forms** use `speedpycom/services/captcha.py`, because
a public form needs a distinction the form field cannot make: reCAPTCHA v3
returns a *probability*, not a verdict.

```python
from speedpycom.services import captcha

result = captcha.verify(token, remote_ip=ip, expected_action="submit")
if result.refuses:
    ...  # no token, or the provider rejected it — this request is malformed
if result.suspicious:
    ...  # verified, low score. ACCEPT and record result.as_metadata()
```

- `refuses` is true only for `absent` and `failed` — a request our own page
  could not have produced. **`low_score` is deliberately not a refusal**:
  discarding a real submission because somebody browses with a strict privacy
  extension is worse than one more item in a queue a human already reviews.
- A caller that guards **a cost** rather than a queue should also refuse a
  clearly-bot score, using the second, lower floor:
  `if result.score is not None and result.score < captcha.gate_min_score()`.
  Two floors because the two questions have opposite error costs —
  `CAPTCHA_MIN_SCORE` (0.5) is "should a human look?", `CAPTCHA_GATE_MIN_SCORE`
  (0.3) is "should we spend money?".
- `unavailable` fails **open**, logged loudly. That covers both a provider
  outage and, importantly, *our own* bad secret — a wrong secret refuses every
  visitor identically, so it must never be read as a bad token.
- Both keys empty ⇒ `disabled`, which never refuses. A fresh checkout runs with
  no CAPTCHA and nothing to remember.
- Run it **last**, after the honeypot, the minimum-fill-time check, the IP
  blocklist and the rate caps. It is a blocking HTTP call
  (`RECAPTCHA_VERIFY_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`, 5s) and a flood must not reach it.
- Pass `expected_action` on any endpoint with a real cost, so a token minted
  for a cheap action cannot be replayed against an expensive one. A provider
  declares `supports_action`; when it does, an EMPTY action fails closed — v3
  always returns one, so a missing action is a token that was not minted the way
  you think.

Swapping provider is a setting: `CAPTCHA_PROVIDER` names a callable taking
`(token, *, remote_ip)` and returning a `ProviderVerdict`. A provider with no
score (reCAPTCHA v2, Turnstile) returns `score=None` and can never produce
`low_score`; one with no action concept leaves `supports_action` False and is
never asked for one. A provider that raises is caught and becomes `unavailable`,
logged with its stack trace — a broken provider must not 500 every public form.

**The trap worth knowing:** `RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY` + `RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY`
are a pair whose mere presence switches reCAPTCHA on across the whole auth
path. If the site key does not have the currently serving host registered,
**nobody can sign in.** Register every host you serve before setting them.

## Environment Setup

The project uses environment variables for configuration. Key variables:

- `DEBUG`: Development mode toggle
- `SECRET_KEY`: Django secret key
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string
- `CELERY_BROKER_URL`: Redis URL for Celery
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: Comma-separated list of allowed hosts

## Deployment

The project is configured for deployment with Appliku:

- Dockerfile included for containerization
- Static file serving via WhiteNoise
- Celery worker and beat processes configured


### Appliku team and application

This section describes the Team and Application name(s) when deployed with Appliku.

It helps AI Agents to properly use Appliku CLI. If the project has more then one environment, all of them must be listed.

Team path: not set
Application name: not set

## Responsiveness

All work must be responsive and work on both mobile and desktop.

After completing every task, check the result on both mobile and desktop and fix any responsive issues you find.

## HTTP API

### Philosophy

- Server-rendered Django + crispy forms remains the default for product UI.
- DRF is for versioned integration endpoints under `/api/v1/`.
- Do not create a new `api` Django app. API code lives in the **owning app**.
- OpenAPI schema at `/api/schema/` is the contract; every new endpoint must
  appear there with `@extend_schema`.
- Ad-hoc `JsonResponse` in `mainapp/views/` is only for tiny UI helpers (tours,
  toggles). CRUD and integration surfaces go through DRF.

### File layout

| You're adding…                    | Put it in                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User / profile API                | `usermodel/api.py` (single-file; do not package-split `usermodel`)         |
| Team / tenant API                 | `mainapp/api/teams.py`                                                     |
| Business resource API             | `mainapp/api/<group>.py` + route in `project/api_urls.py`                  |
| Shared API permissions / mixins   | `speedpycom/api/` (cross-cutting helpers only, not feature code)           |
| API tests                         | `mainapp/tests/test_api_<group>.py` or next to the owning app              |

Re-export public API views from `mainapp/api/__init__.py` when useful, mirroring
the package-style pattern used for models and views.

### URL conventions

- Version prefix: `/api/v1/`
- User-global resources: `/api/v1/me/`
- Team-scoped resources: `/api/v1/teams/{team_id}/<resource>/`
- Use UUID path segments for object IDs (matches `BaseModel` primary keys).
- Timestamps: UTC ISO-8601. Pagination: global `PageNumberPagination` defaults.
- Nested collections use trailing slashes consistently with existing Django URL style.

### Serializer and view conventions

- **Read-only, deliberately shaped responses** (e.g. `/me/`): plain `Serializer`,
  not `ModelSerializer`, so every exposed field is explicit.
- **CRUD on models**: `ModelSerializer` + generic views (`ListCreateAPIView`,
  `RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView`) or thin `APIView` subclasses.
- **Current user**: resolve from `request.user`, not a URL primary key. Use
  `APIView`, not `RetrieveAPIView`, for `/me/`.
- **Team context**: never trust `team_id` from the request body. Resolve from the
  URL and verify membership before any queryset access.

### OpenAPI requirements

Every endpoint must include:

- `@extend_schema` with `tags`, `operation_id`, `summary`, and request/response
  serializers.
- Tags mirror the resource group (`user`, `teams`, `<business-group>`).
- Document auth requirements and common error responses (`401`, `403`, `404`,
  validation errors).

Add new tags to `SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS["TAGS"]` when introducing a resource group.

### Scope conventions

Boilerplate ships scopes for profile and teams only:

| Scope            | Grants                                          |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `read:profile`   | `GET /api/v1/me/`                               |
| `write:profile`  | `PATCH /api/v1/me/`                             |
| `read:teams`     | Team list, detail, members (read)               |
| `write:teams`    | Invitations and other team writes               |
| `admin`          | Reserved for future elevated operations         |

When adding a business API, agents must:

1. Define scope names: `read:<domain>`, `write:<domain>` (e.g. `read:products`).
2. Document scopes in OpenAPI endpoint descriptions.
3. Add scope checks to permission classes using `HasScope` from
   `speedpycom.api.permissions` and set `required_scopes` on the view.
   Stub checks are acceptable before Phase 6; enforcement becomes mandatory
   once OAuth/PAT lands.
4. Never invent ad-hoc permission strings outside this taxonomy.

Custom scopes are **user-owned**. SpeedPy documents the pattern; fork owners
register scopes for their models.

### Tenant isolation checklist

Agents must follow this for every team-scoped endpoint:

1. Filter querysets through the current user's `TeamMembership` rows.
2. Object lookup must not bypass membership checks (return `404` for unknown or
   inaccessible teams, matching web view behavior).
3. Write actions require role checks (`owner`, `admin`, `member`).
4. Use `select_related()` / `prefetch_related()` on list endpoints.
5. Respect `SPEEDPY_TEAMS_ENABLED`; return `404` when teams are disabled.
6. Add **cross-team negative tests** for every new resource.

**Reference implementation:** `mainapp/api/teams.py` shows the canonical pattern.
Use `_check_teams_enabled()` and `_get_membership(user, team_id)` helpers for
consistent 404 behavior. Team-scoped business resources nest under
`/api/v1/teams/{team_id}/<resource>/` — register routes in `project/api_urls.py`.

### Testing requirements

For each new endpoint:

- Anonymous requests are rejected.
- Authenticated happy path returns expected status and field contract.
- Field keys are stable (test exact keys for integration surfaces).
- Tenant isolation: member of team A cannot access team B's objects.
- Role boundaries: writes respect owner/admin/member rules.
- Generated schema includes the new `operation_id`.

Validation after changes:

```bash
uv run python manage.py spectacular --file /tmp/speedpy-openapi.yaml --validate
uv run python manage.py test
```

### Canonical examples

| Pattern              | Reference implementation                           | Phase |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------|
| User read            | `GET /api/v1/me/` in `usermodel/api.py`            | 1     |
| User write           | `PATCH /api/v1/me/` in `usermodel/api.py`          | 2     |
| Business list/detail | `mainapp/api/products.py` (read-only Product API)  | 2     |
| JWT auth             | `POST /api/auth/token/` (simplejwt)                 | 3     |
| PAT management       | `usermodel/models.PersonalAccessToken`              | 4     |
| Bearer auth          | `speedpycom/api/authentication.py`                  | 4     |
| Team list/detail     | `mainapp/api/teams.py`                              | 5     |
| Team members         | `GET /api/v1/teams/{id}/members/`                   | 5     |
| Team invitations     | `POST /api/v1/teams/{id}/invitations/`              | 5     |
| OAuth2 provider      | `django-oauth-toolkit` at `/o/`                     | 6     |

Agents should read the reference implementation before adding a new resource.

### Agent workflow

For the full step-by-step recipe (model, serializer, views, scopes, URLs, tests, schema, webhooks, CLI/MCP examples), use the **`/add-integration-api`** skill. Quick summary:

1. Model in `mainapp/models/<domain>.py` (`BaseModel` or `TeamModel`).
2. Serializer + views in `mainapp/api/<domain>.py`.
3. Re-export views from `mainapp/api/__init__.py`.
4. Register URLs in `project/api_urls.py`.
5. Define `read:<domain>` / `write:<domain>` scopes (settings, forms, schema components), add tag to `SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS["TAGS"]`, and set `required_scopes` on views with `HasScope`.
6. Tests: anonymous rejection, happy path, field contract, tenant isolation, role boundaries, schema validation.
7. Run `python manage.py spectacular --validate --fail-on-warn`.
8. (Optional) Register webhook events in `mainapp/webhooks/events.py`.
9. Add CLI subcommand + MCP tool in `examples/`.

### Personal access tokens (PATs)

Users create and manage PATs at `/accounts/tokens/`. Tokens authenticate API
requests via the `Authorization: Bearer spd_<hex>` header.

**Model:** `usermodel.models.PersonalAccessToken`
- Tokens are **never stored in plaintext** — only a SHA-256 hash is persisted.
- The raw token is returned **once** at creation time and cannot be recovered.
- Each token has: `name`, `scopes` (JSON list), `expires_at` (optional),
  `last_used_at` (updated on every authenticated request), `is_revoked`.

**Authentication:** `speedpycom.api.authentication.PersonalAccessTokenAuthentication`
is registered in `REST_FRAMEWORK["DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES"]`. It runs
before `SessionAuthentication` and only handles `spd_`-prefixed Bearer tokens,
letting JWTs pass through to `JWTAuthentication`.

**Audit logging:** Token creation, revocation, successful auth, and failed auth
attempts are logged via `structlog` with `user_id`, `token_id`, and `token_name`.

**Scopes on PATs:** Tokens can carry optional scopes (e.g.
`["read:profile", "read:teams"]`). An empty scopes list means full access.
`HasScope` enforces scope checks: if a PAT has scopes, the request is only
allowed when the token's scopes include all of the view's `required_scopes`.
Session-authenticated users have implicit full access.

**Adding custom scopes for PATs:** When you add a new business API resource:

1. Add `read:<domain>` / `write:<domain>` scopes to `OAUTH2_PROVIDER["SCOPES"]`
   in `project/settings.py`. The PAT form picks them up automatically via the
   scope registry in `speedpycom.api.scopes`.
2. Set `required_scopes` on the view with `HasScope` permission class.
3. Update `SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS["APPEND_COMPONENTS"]` OAuth2 flows to match.

### CORS policy

CORS is configured via `django-cors-headers` and scoped to `/api/` URLs only
(`CORS_URLS_REGEX = r"^/api/"`). Non-API routes (`/accounts/`, `/demo/`, `/o/`,
etc.) are unaffected.

**When CORS is needed:**

- Browser-based SPA clients calling the API cross-origin.
- OAuth2 interactive flows where the browser calls `/api/` endpoints directly.

**When CORS is NOT needed:**

- Server-to-server integrations using PAT or JWT (`Authorization: Bearer …`
  from a backend or script) — browser CORS policy does not apply.
- CLI tools, MCP servers, CI/CD pipelines — these are not browsers.

**Environment variables:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `[]` | Comma-separated list of allowed origins (e.g. `https://app.example.com`) |
| `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS` | `True` in DEBUG, `False` otherwise | Allow any origin. A startup guard raises `ImproperlyConfigured` if `True` with `DEBUG=False`. |
| `CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS` | `False` | Whether to allow credentials (cookies/auth headers). Most token clients do not need this. |

Session-based CSRF is unchanged — `CsrfViewMiddleware` still enforces same-origin
write protection for session-authenticated requests.

**Note:** The OAuth2 endpoints live under `/o/`, outside the `/api/` CORS scope.
If a browser SPA needs to call `/o/token/` directly, extend `CORS_URLS_REGEX` or
add a separate configuration.

### Explicit non-goals (ask user first)

- Custom error envelopes.
- New top-level Django apps for API code.
- Exposing `is_staff`, `is_superuser`, passwords, or raw storage paths.
- Unscoped querysets on `TeamModel` subclasses.

### API docs visibility

- `API_DOCS_PUBLIC=True` (default in `DEBUG`): schema, Swagger, and ReDoc are public.
- `API_DOCS_PUBLIC=False` (default in production): schema, Swagger, and ReDoc require
  staff login.

### Authentication

Four authentication methods are supported (tried in order):

1. **Personal access token** (automation): `Authorization: Bearer spd_<hex>`.
   Created at `/accounts/tokens/`. Supports optional scopes and expiry.
2. **JWT** (first-party clients): `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`.
   Obtain at `POST /api/auth/token/` with email+password.
   Refresh at `POST /api/auth/token/refresh/`.
   Revoke at `POST /api/auth/token/revoke/`.
   Access tokens expire in 15 minutes; refresh tokens in 7 days.
   Refresh tokens rotate on use and old tokens are blacklisted.
3. **OAuth2** (third-party apps, CLI, MCP): `Authorization: Bearer <oauth2_token>`.
   Authorization Code + PKCE for web apps. Device Authorization Grant for
   CLI/MCP clients. Manage applications in Django admin. Consent screen at
   `/o/authorize/`. Token endpoint at `/o/token/`.
   Scopes: `read:profile`, `write:profile`, `read:teams`, `write:teams`,
   `read:products`, `admin`.
4. **Session auth** (browser): works with allauth login, CSRF enforced on writes.

### OAuth2 application lifecycle

1. Register the application in Django admin (`oauth2_provider > Applications`).
2. Choose grant type: Authorization Code (web) or Device Code (CLI/MCP).
3. PKCE is required for authorization code flows.
4. Users authorize via the consent screen at `/o/authorize/`.
5. Exchange authorization code for tokens at `/o/token/`.
6. Refresh tokens rotate automatically; revoked tokens are rejected.

### Registering custom scopes for OAuth2

When adding a business API with new scopes:

1. Add the scope to `OAUTH2_PROVIDER["SCOPES"]` in `project/settings.py`.
   The PAT form picks it up automatically via `speedpycom.api.scopes`.
2. Add it to the `SPECTACULAR_SETTINGS["APPEND_COMPONENTS"]` OAuth2 flows.
3. Set `required_scopes` on the view with `HasScope`.

### CLI/MCP device flow

For CLI tools and MCP servers that cannot open a browser redirect:

1. Register a **public** application with grant type **Device Code**.
2. Client calls `POST /o/device-authorization/` with `client_id` and `scope`
   (content type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`).
3. Response includes `device_code`, `user_code`, and `verification_uri`.
4. User opens `/o/device/` in a browser, enters `user_code`, and approves.
5. Client polls `POST /o/token/` with `grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code`
   and `device_code` until the user approves or the code expires.

### CLI and MCP starter examples

The `examples/` directory contains ready-to-use client code:

| Example                           | Description                                    |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `examples/cli/speedpy_cli.py`     | CLI with PAT and device-flow auth, `me`/`teams` commands |
| `examples/mcp_server/speedpy_mcp.py` | MCP server exposing API tools for AI assistants |
| `examples/README.md`             | Setup, auth flows, and extension guide          |

**Management command:** `python manage.py create_oauth2_app "App Name"` registers
a device-flow OAuth2 application and prints the client ID.

When adding a new business API endpoint, also add:
1. A CLI subcommand in `examples/cli/speedpy_cli.py` using `api_get()`.
2. An `@mcp.tool()` function in `examples/mcp_server/speedpy_mcp.py` using `_api_get()`.

Examples must stay generic — avoid project-specific business assumptions.

### Integration auth recommendations

Use this table to choose the right auth method for each integration scenario.
Both PAT and OAuth2 are needed — OAuth2 is the primary path for interactive
integrations; PATs are the automation shortcut.

| Use case | Auth method | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Remote MCP server (Claude, Cursor, etc.) | OAuth2 Device Code | MCP spec mandates OAuth 2.1 for remote servers. PATs are "generally unsuitable" per the spec. |
| ChatGPT / GPT Actions | OAuth2 Authorization Code + PKCE | Per-user access with consent screen. |
| First-party CLI | OAuth2 Device Code (primary), PAT (fallback) | Device flow gives scoped, refreshable tokens. PAT for quick scripting. |
| CI/CD pipelines | PAT | Non-interactive, no browser. Use short-lived scoped tokens. |
| Shell scripts / cron jobs | PAT | Static bearer token via env var. |
| n8n / Make.com / Zapier | OAuth2 Authorization Code + PKCE | These platforms support OAuth natively. PAT fallback for n8n "Header Auth". |
| Local/stdio MCP server (dev) | PAT via env var | Token configured out-of-band in MCP client config. Outside MCP auth spec scope. |
| Server-to-server | PAT | Client Credentials grant can be added later if needed. |

**Quick start — connect an MCP server:**

1. `python manage.py create_oauth2_app "My MCP Server"` → note the `client_id`
2. Configure the MCP server with `client_id` and your instance URL
3. On first use, the MCP client triggers device flow → user approves in browser → done

**Quick start — CLI or script:**

1. Go to `/accounts/tokens/` → create a PAT with desired scopes
2. `export SPEEDPY_API_TOKEN=spd_...`
3. Use `Authorization: Bearer spd_...` in requests

### Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591)

The MCP spec recommends Dynamic Client Registration so MCP clients can
self-register without manual admin setup. SpeedPy provides an optional
registration endpoint at `POST /o/register/`.

**Request** (unauthenticated):

```json
{
  "client_name": "My MCP Client",
  "grant_types": ["urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code"],
  "scope": "read:profile read:teams",
  "token_endpoint_auth_method": "none"
}
```

**Response** (`201 Created`):

```json
{
  "client_id": "abc123...",
  "client_name": "My MCP Client",
  "grant_types": ["urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code"],
  "scope": "read:profile read:teams",
  "token_endpoint_auth_method": "none",
  "client_id_issued_at": 1750000000
}
```

Confidential clients (Authorization Code grant) also receive a `client_secret`.

To restrict open registration, set `DCR_ENABLED = False` in settings (default:
`True` in development, `False` in production). When disabled, applications
must be registered via Django admin or the `create_oauth2_app` management
command.

## Template comments: always `{% comment %}`, never `{# #}`

**Hard rule. `{# #}` is banned in templates.** A test fails on any occurrence.

The short form works right up until somebody wraps the line, and then it stops
being a comment and starts printing to the page — Django's `{# #}` is
single-line only. Nothing errors, the page still returns 200, and every
assertion about its content still passes.

That has already shipped twice here. Once above the sign-in form, and once inside
`{% if activating %}` on the billing overview, which is the post-checkout state a
paying customer sees. The reason it survives review is that the harmless cases
are indistinguishable from the broken ones in a diff: a comment placed between
`{% extends %}` and the first `{% block %}` is discarded with all other
out-of-block content, so it looks fine forever, while the identical construct
inside a block leaks.

```django
{% comment %}
Use this. It behaves the same on one line or ten.
{% endcomment %}
```

`{% comment %}` also nests other tags safely, which `{# #}` does not.

## Use the design system, do not re-create it

`static/mainapp/input.css` defines the components — buttons, alerts, badges,
cards, inputs, papers, progress. Reach for those before writing raw utilities.
The gallery at `/speedpyui-preview/` shows every one, and
`speedpycom/tests/test_design_system.py` guards the rules below.

**Never hardcode a theme colour.** `bg-[#7582EB]` was the signup button for a
long time. That hex is the DARK theme's `--color-primary-main` inlined, paired
with `text-gray-900`, which is the dark theme's `--color-primary-contrast`. So in
LIGHT mode the button was the wrong colour with near-black text, and nobody
noticed. `btn btn-contained btn-primary btn-lg` is identical in dark and correct
in light. A test now fails on any `bg-[#...]` in Python or in a template.

**A class that appears nowhere does not exist.** Tailwind compiles only what it
can see, so a variant declared in `input.css` and used in no template is absent
from `styles.css` — and using it later renders *nothing*, with no error.
`alert-neutral` sat in exactly that state until it was added to the gallery.
**50 of 243 component classes still are** (blockquotes, displays, modal,
tooltip, tabs, several progress and paper variants). If you need one, add it to
the gallery in the same commit and run `npm run tailwind:build`.

Audit the gap:

```bash
python -c "
import re, pathlib;
inp=pathlib.Path('static/mainapp/input.css').read_text();
out=pathlib.Path('static/mainapp/styles.css').read_text();
d=set();
[d.update(re.findall(r'\.([\w-]+)', m.group(1))) for m in re.finditer(r'^\s*((?:\.[\w-]+)(?:[.\s,]+\.[\w-]+)*)\s*\{', inp, re.M)];
print(sorted(c for c in d if f'.{c}' not in out))
"
```

**Missing a component that every Tailwind kit ships?** Build it in `input.css`,
show it in the gallery, and it is available everywhere. The gallery does double
duty on purpose: it forces classes into the build AND documents them for the
next person or agent.

**Contained buttons lighten on hover in dark mode.** Not a preference — the
contained variants take their text from `--color-*-contrast`, which is dark in
the dark theme, so darkening the background on hover collapsed primary from
5.19:1 to 2.86:1, under WCAG AA. Lightening gives 6.86:1.

## Blocked email domains

Two lists, and the split is the whole point.

| List | File | Who owns it |
|---|---|---|
| Throwaway-mail providers (~8,000 domains) | `speedpycom/data/disposable_email_blocklist.conf` | **upstream** — replaced wholesale on refresh |
| This project's own | `blocked_email_domains.txt` (repo root) | **the project** — upstream never writes to it |

**Never add a domain to the bundled file.** It is overwritten every time it is
refreshed, so the edit disappears without a trace. Project domains go in
`blocked_email_domains.txt`, or in `SPEEDPY_BLOCKED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` for a one-off
block with no deploy. Both sources are merged, not one-or-the-other.

**The purpose is narrow: these are domains we do not send email to.** Not access
control, not authorization. So it is enforced where an address enters and again
where mail would otherwise leave:

| Where | Effect |
|---|---|
| `UsermodelSignupForm.clean()` | signup refused, address never stored |
| `UsermodelAddEmailForm.clean_email` | add-email refused before it is stored, so no confirmation mail is attempted |
| `speedpycom/email_backends.py` | recipient dropped before the ESP sees it |

The entry checks are self-service only: an admin who sets `User.email` directly,
a CSV import, or allauth headless all bypass the forms. Every point calls
`speedpycom/services/email_domains.py::is_blocked`. At the form doors it runs
before the MX lookup, because two in-memory set lookups cost nothing next to a
DNS call with a two-second budget. The send-time guard is the backstop for
whatever entered another way.

Direct backend construction (`get_connection(...)`) bypasses the send-time guard
and nothing here can prevent that — catch it in review.

**Two address spellings used to slip past, both fixed, both worth knowing if you
write a similar check:** a display-name recipient (`"Name <user@blocked>"`, where
splitting at the last `@` yields `blocked>`), and a Unicode domain against a
punycode list entry (the bundled list has `xn--` entries, and Django punycodes on
the way out). Addresses go through `parseaddr`, and every domain is canonicalised
to one IDNA form.

Format: one domain per line, `#` comments, blank lines ignored, matching is
case-insensitive. A **leading dot** covers subdomains: `.corp.example` blocks
`corp.example` and `mail.corp.example`, while a bare `corp.example` blocks only
itself. That asymmetry is deliberate — silently blocking every subdomain of a
bare entry would surprise people.

Settings: `SPEEDPY_BLOCK_DISPOSABLE_EMAIL_DOMAINS` (default **True**),
`SPEEDPY_BLOCKED_EMAIL_DOMAINS_FILE`, `SPEEDPY_BLOCKED_EMAIL_DOMAINS`. Turning
the bundled list off does **not** disable the project list; they are two
decisions.

### Refreshing the bundled list

Source: <https://github.com/disposable-email-domains/disposable-email-domains>
(CC0-1.0, so no attribution obligation — recorded so you know where to look).

```bash
curl -sS -o speedpycom/data/disposable_email_blocklist.conf \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/disposable-email-domains/disposable-email-domains/main/disposable_email_blocklist.conf
```

**No automation, on purpose.** A signup gate that changes what it rejects on a
schedule, unattended, is not a thing to want. Refresh it by hand and read the
diff.

Then run `python manage.py test speedpycom.tests.test_email_domains`. It asserts
the list does not contain any of twenty real providers — because the failure mode
of a bad upstream pull request is that signups from Gmail stop working, nothing
errors, nothing logs, and nobody complains, since they cannot sign up to
complain.

That list of ~8,000 vetted domains was chosen over the aggregated 100,000+ ones
on purpose: refusing one real customer costs more than letting a throwaway
signup through.

### The refusal message

One message for every reason, from `email_domains.BLOCKED_EMAIL_MESSAGE`, and it
says nothing about which list matched or why. A wording per reason *is* the
diagnosis, and a person probing the filter learns from it what to try next. The
cost is that a real customer hits a wall, which is why the message points at
support. Keep it that way — and if you add another reason for refusing an
address, reuse this message rather than writing a second one.

## Email bounces and suppression

**This already exists. Do not build it again.** If a project needs to stop
emailing addresses that bounce, wire what is here rather than writing a new one.

It is deliberately in two halves, and knowing which is which saves a rewrite
when the ESP changes:

**Enforcement — provider-agnostic, always on.**

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| `SuppressedEmail`, `EmailEvent` | `speedpycom/models/email_events.py` |
| record / suppress / release / query | `speedpycom/services/email_events.py` |
| pre-send guard | `speedpycom/email_backends.py` |
| "we stopped emailing you" notice | `speedpycom/templatetags/suppression.py` + `templates/account/snippets/_suppression_warning.html` |

`POST_OFFICE["BACKENDS"]["default"]` is the guard, which wraps whatever
`EMAIL_PROVIDER` resolves to. That is the point: allauth mail, invitations and
any third-party package are covered without touching their call sites. None of
this cares which ESP you use.

**Detection — Amazon-specific, opt-in.**

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| SNS signature verification | `speedpycom/services/sns.py` |
| webhook view | `speedpycom/views_ses.py` |
| URL, not routed by default | `speedpycom/urls_email_events.py` |

On another ESP, write this half yourself and call
`speedpycom.services.email_events.suppress()` from it. Everything downstream
already works.

### Four things that will bite you

1. **A transient bounce must never suppress.** An out-of-office auto-reply
   arrives as a bounce event. Suppress on "bounce" without reading the
   permanence and everyone who goes on holiday stops receiving your email,
   permanently, with nothing to tell you.
2. **Anymail's normalized `tracking` signal flattens exactly that
   distinction.** It looks like the obvious provider-agnostic route, but
   `anymail/webhooks/amazon_ses.py` maps *every* SES bounce, permanent and
   transient, to `EventType.BOUNCED`. The permanence survives only in
   `description` ("Transient: General") and the raw `esp_event`. Read those, or
   you ship the bug in point 1.
3. **A configuration set is a second IAM resource.** Setting
   `AWS_SES_CONFIGURATION_SET` without adding the configuration-set ARN to the
   sending policy's `Resource` denies **every** send — and post_office swallows
   it into the database while the page still says the mail was sent.
4. **Tell people you stopped.** Suppression without a notice means a customer
   whose mailbox filled up goes silent forever: no password resets, no error,
   no explanation. The account-page notice is included in
   `templates/account/email.html` for exactly this.

### Tenant attribution

`EmailEvent.team` is filled by whatever `SPEEDPY_EMAIL_EVENT_TEAM_RESOLVER`
points at — a dotted path taking a recipient and returning a `Team` or `None`.
Unset by default. **Whatever you write there must return `None` when the answer
is ambiguous**; an address belonging to two customers has no single right
answer, and a null is honest where a guess is not.

Full setup, including the AWS side, is in `speedpy-docs/docs/email-bounces.md`.

## Team deletion (owner-only, with an undo window)

A team is the foreign key of every tenant row, so ending one is the most
destructive action a customer has. It is also the gap that used to leave
abandoned teams — and whatever they still serve publicly — in the database
forever, with no way to remove them outside the admin.

**Setting.** `SPEEDPY_TEAM_DELETION_DELAY_HOURS`, default 24. `0` deletes on the
click. Anything else schedules the deletion that many hours out and lets any
owner undo it until then. The copy beside the button follows the setting, so
there is one source of truth for the number.

**Where it lives.**

| Piece | File |
|---|---|
| Fields + lifecycle + the billing invariant | `mainapp/models/teams.py` (`Team.request_deletion`, `cancel_scheduled_deletion`, `deletion_blocked_reason`, `delete`) |
| The finalizer and the cleanup-hook runner | `mainapp/models/teams.py` (`finalize_team_deletion`, `run_team_cleanup_hooks`) |
| Owner-only views | `mainapp/views/teams.py` (`TeamOwnerRequiredMixin`, `TeamDeleteView`, `TeamDeleteCancelView`) |
| Danger zone UI | `templates/mainapp/teams/settings.html` |
| Hourly purge | `mainapp/tasks/teams.py::purge_scheduled_team_deletions`, beat entry in `project/celeryapp.py` |
| Tests | `mainapp/tests/test_team_deletion.py` (33) |

**Four decisions, each with a reason. Do not "tidy" any of them away.**

1. **A scheduled team stays active.** `TeamViewMixin` resolves `is_active` teams
   only, so setting `is_active=False` when scheduling would hide the undo button
   behind a 404 from the one person allowed to press it. The team is not deleted
   yet; it keeps working until it is.
2. **A live subscription blocks the deletion, everywhere.** `active`, `past_due`
   and `paused` all block (`BillingSubscription.ACTIVE_ISH_STATUSES`) — `past_due`
   can still retry a card and `paused` can resume. `canceled` does not block,
   even inside its paid period: nobody is charged again. The check is **not**
   gated on `SPEEDPY_BILLING_ENABLED`, because that flag says whether you sell,
   not whether a provider is charging. It runs in the view, again in the purge
   task, and last of all in `Team.delete()` so admin and shell cannot walk around
   it. Checkout is refused for a scheduled team for the same reason
   (`mainapp/views/billing.py::start_checkout`).
3. **The purge deletes one team per transaction, under `select_for_update`.** A
   bulk queryset delete would bypass `Team.delete()` and with it the invariant,
   and it would race with an undo.
4. **Object storage is the project's problem, not the boilerplate's.** A cascade
   deletes rows and nothing else, so files (logos, uploads, transcoded video, CDN
   copies) outlive their rows: unreachable, still paid for, sometimes still
   publicly readable. `SPEEDPY_TEAM_DELETION_CLEANUP_HOOKS` is a list of dotted
   paths, each called with the team **before** the rows go. A hook must be
   idempotent and must **raise** on failure — a raising hook keeps the team
   scheduled so the next run retries, which is why the rows are not deleted
   first.

**Two limits worth knowing before you trust the retry story.** The rollback
covers *database* writes only — a hook that deleted an object from storage and
then failed cannot put it back, so a hook should do its most fragile work first.
And a hook only fails loudly if the code it calls raises: a teardown that
delegates to something which logs-and-continues (a CDN purge, typically) reports
success to the finalizer whatever happened underneath.

Deletion routes through the finalizer from **every** entrance: the zero-hour
path, the purge task, and both admin deletes (`delete_model` and
`delete_queryset` — the bulk action never calls `Model.delete()`, so without the
override it skipped the subscription rule too).

## Purging unconfirmed signups

Email verification is mandatory, so a signup that never confirms leaves a row
nobody can ever use: the person cannot sign in, and if their address is on the
suppression list they cannot even be sent another confirmation — the mail is
dropped before it reaches the provider. The account exists, holds a team, and
does nothing.

The other option — refusing such an address at the signup form and saying why —
was considered and rejected: telling somebody which addresses are refused teaches
a throwaway-mail user which providers still work, and the blocklist exists
precisely so that conversation never happens. So the signup succeeds, and this
removes it later.

**Off by default.** A boilerplate that deletes user accounts on a timer without
being asked would be a nasty surprise.

```python
SPEEDPY_UNCONFIRMED_ACCOUNT_PURGE_DAYS = 7    # 0 = off
```

Preview before switching it on — this is what `--dry-run` is for:

```bash
uv run python manage.py purge_unconfirmed_accounts --dry-run
```

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| The service | `speedpycom/services/account_purge.py::UnconfirmedAccountPurge` |
| Daily task | `speedpycom/tasks.py::purge_unconfirmed_accounts` (beat at 04:30) |
| Command | `speedpycom/management/commands/purge_unconfirmed_accounts.py` |
| The team half | `mainapp/models/teams.py::delete_sole_member_teams`, registered as a hook |
| Tests | `speedpycom/tests/test_account_purge.py` (23) + `mainapp/tests/test_team_deletion.py::PurgedAccountTeamTests` |

**The predicate is deliberately narrow.** Every exclusion is somebody's real
account: it must be active, neither staff nor superuser, have **never logged in**,
have **at least one** `EmailAddress` row with **none** verified, and be older than
the window. The "at least one" is what protects a user created by hand in the
admin — such a row often has no `EmailAddress` at all and would match a bare
"has no verified address" test.

**The window must exceed `ACCOUNT_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION_EXPIRE_DAYS`** (allauth's
default is 3), or the purge races the last valid click on a confirmation link. 7
is the recommended value for a 3-day link.

**The team is not optional.** `Team` has no foreign key to a user — membership is
the only link, and that cascades — so without the hook every purged signup leaves
its auto-provisioned team behind for good. Only teams where the purged user was
the **last** member are deleted; a shared team belongs to whoever is left. It goes
through `finalize_team_deletion`, so the project's storage teardown runs and a
team that is still being charged raises instead — which keeps the account too,
because a paid team is not something to remove on a timer.

**Change it by subclassing, not by editing.** Point
`SPEEDPY_UNCONFIRMED_ACCOUNT_PURGE_CLASS` at your own subclass and override
`queryset()` or `purge_user()`. Same reasoning as everywhere else in
`speedpycom/`: a project that edits the package inherits a merge conflict on
every update.

## Webhook Extension Guide

This section explains how to add a new webhook event type to SpeedPy. The
delivery infrastructure (endpoint model, dispatch function, Celery task, HMAC
signing) is already built — you only need to register the event, call
`dispatch_event()` from business logic, add a test, and update docs.

### Architecture overview

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Event registry | `mainapp/webhooks/events.py` | `WebhookEvent` class with constants, `ALL` frozenset, `CHOICES` tuple |
| Dispatch | `mainapp/webhooks/dispatch.py` | `dispatch_event(team, event_type, data)` — creates delivery rows and enqueues Celery tasks via `transaction.on_commit` |
| Delivery task | `mainapp/tasks/webhooks.py` | HMAC-signed POST with exponential-backoff retries (up to 8) |
| Signing | `mainapp/webhooks/signing.py` | `sign()` / `verify()` HMAC-SHA256 helpers |
| Endpoint model | `mainapp/models/webhooks.py` | `WebhookEndpoint` (subscription) and `WebhookDelivery` (delivery log) |
| Tests | `mainapp/tests/test_webhooks.py` | Model, dispatch, signing, and admin tests |

### Naming convention

Event names are lowercase and dot-separated, following the pattern
`resource.action` or `resource.sub_resource.action` when a sub-resource
is involved.

Examples: `order.created`, `team.member.added`, `team.invitation.created`,
`user.profile.updated`, `invoice.payment.failed`.

### Step-by-step: adding a new event (e.g. `order.created`)

#### Step 1 — Register the event constant

Add the constant to `WebhookEvent` in `mainapp/webhooks/events.py` and include
it in the `ALL` frozenset:

             TEAM_MEMBER_ADDED,
             TEAM_INVITATION_CREATED,
             USER_PROFILE_UPDATED,
+            ORDER_CREATED,
         }
     )
```

#### Step 2 — Call `dispatch_event()` from business logic

Import the dispatch function and call it after the relevant database write
succeeds. The `data` dict is the event-specific payload — include only stable
IDs and timestamps, not localized display strings or cross-tenant data.

```python
from mainapp.webhooks.dispatch import dispatch_event
from mainapp.webhooks.events import WebhookEvent

# Inside a view, signal handler, model method, or Celery task —
# after the DB write that creates the order:
dispatch_event(
    team=order.team,
    event_type=WebhookEvent.ORDER_CREATED,
    data={
        "order_id": str(order.id),
        "total": str(order.total),
        "currency": order.currency,
        "created_at": order.created_at.isoformat(),
    },
)
```

**Placement rules:**

- Call `dispatch_event()` **after** the DB write that triggers the event.
- `dispatch_event()` uses `transaction.on_commit` internally, so delivery rows
  are enqueued only after the current transaction commits. If your code is
  already inside `transaction.atomic()`, the dispatch is safe as-is.
- For user-scoped events (like `user.profile.updated`), dispatch once per team
  the user belongs to — iterate over memberships.

**Payload `data` dict guidelines:**

- Use stable identifiers (UUIDs, not sequential IDs that differ across environments).
- Include UTC ISO-8601 timestamps.
- Never include secrets, passwords, or raw file paths.
- Never leak cross-tenant data — the payload should only contain information
  the subscribing team is authorized to see.
- Envelope fields (`event_id`, `event_type`, `timestamp`, `api_version`) are
  added automatically by `dispatch_event()` — only provide the `data` dict.

#### Step 3 — Add a test

Add a test in `mainapp/tests/test_webhooks.py` that triggers the event and
asserts a `WebhookDelivery` row is created with the correct `event_type` and
payload shape:

```python
class OrderWebhookDispatchTests(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.team = Team.objects.create(name="Acme", slug="acme")
        self.endpoint = WebhookEndpoint.objects.create(
            team=self.team,
            url="https://example.com/hook",
            events=["order.created"],
        )

    @override_settings(CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER=True)
    @patch("mainapp.tasks.webhooks.deliver_webhook.delay")
    def test_order_created_dispatch(self, mock_deliver):
        from mainapp.webhooks.dispatch import dispatch_event

        ids = dispatch_event(
            team=self.team,
            event_type=WebhookEvent.ORDER_CREATED,
            data={"order_id": "abc-123", "total": "99.00", "currency": "USD"},
        )
        self.assertEqual(len(ids), 1)
        delivery = WebhookDelivery.objects.get(pk=ids[0])
        self.assertEqual(delivery.event_type, "order.created")
        self.assertIn("order_id", delivery.payload["data"])
        self.assertIn("event_id", delivery.payload)
        self.assertIn("timestamp", delivery.payload)
```

**Test coverage checklist:**

- Delivery row is created with the correct `event_type`.
- `payload["data"]` has the expected keys.
- Envelope fields (`event_id`, `event_type`, `timestamp`, `api_version`) are present.
- Endpoints not subscribed to this event do **not** receive a delivery.
- Wildcard (`["*"]`) endpoints **do** receive the new event.

#### Step 4 — Update the docs

Add the new event to the taxonomy table in `speedpy-docs/docs/webhooks.md`
under the **v1 Events** section:

```markdown
| `order.created` | A new order is placed |
```

### Self-review checklist

Use this checklist before marking the work done:

- [ ] Constant added to `WebhookEvent` in `mainapp/webhooks/events.py` and
      included in `ALL`
- [ ] `dispatch_event()` called from the right place in business logic
- [ ] Payload `data` dict contains only tenant-safe, stable fields
- [ ] Test asserts delivery row creation and payload shape
- [ ] Event added to `speedpy-docs/docs/webhooks.md` taxonomy table

### Current status of v1 events

The three v1 events (`team.member.added`, `team.invitation.created`,
`user.profile.updated`) are defined in the event registry but are **not yet
dispatched from production code paths** (views, signals). They are exercised
in tests and the manual "test event" API endpoint. Wiring these events into
production business logic is tracked separately and is not part of this
extension guide.

## Production Readiness / Strip Demo Content

SpeedPy ships demo and placeholder content as teaching examples: `demoapp/`
(Product CRUD), demo API endpoints (`/api/v1/products/`, `/api/v1/jobs/demo/`),
a demo Celery task (`run_demo_job`), placeholder pages (welcome, pricing), and
`DEMO_MODE` login credentials. Fork owners should remove these before
production.

**Resources:**

- **`PRODUCTION_READY.md`** — step-by-step human checklist for stripping demo
  content. Covers fresh forks and existing databases.
- **`demo-content.json`** — machine-readable manifest of every demo artifact
  with category, paths, removal action, and verification terms.
- **`/strip-demo` skill** (`.claude/skills/strip-demo/SKILL.md`) — audit-first
  agent workflow. Reads the manifest, scans for `SPEEDPY_DEMO` markers,
  presents a removal plan, and waits for confirmation before editing anything.

**Quick audit:** `rg SPEEDPY_DEMO` finds all marked demo artifacts. Every
marker corresponds to an entry in `demo-content.json`.

**Unroute every preview and example page before production.** The SpeedPy UI
preview (`/speedpyui-preview/` and `/speedpyui-preview/FormView`) is a component
gallery for development, and it is routed by default — so a fresh deploy serves
it publicly to anyone who guesses the URL. It leaks no secrets, but it is an
internal tool on a customer-facing domain and it widens the attack surface for
no benefit. Found live on a real deployment, returning 200.

**Keep the views and templates; remove only the `path()` entries.** The gallery
is what forces every design-system class into the Tailwind build — Tailwind
compiles only the classes it can see, so deleting those templates silently drops
`btn-outlined`, `alert-warning` and friends out of `styles.css`, and the failure
shows up later as a component that renders unstyled. Re-add the routes locally
whenever you work on the design system.

The same rule applies to anything else that exists to demonstrate rather than to
serve: sample dashboards, fixture browsers, mail previews, API playgrounds.

**Key decisions for fork owners:**

- `AsyncJob` model and `JobStatusView` are **reusable infrastructure** — keep
  them if your app needs async job status polling. Only remove the demo entry
  point (`DemoJobCreateView`, `run_demo_job`).
- Placeholder pages (welcome, pricing) should be **replaced**, not deleted —
  the root URL must resolve.
- Tests in `test_api_pagination.py`, `test_api_throttle.py`, and
  `test_api_request_id.py` use `/api/v1/products/` as a convenience endpoint.
  Migrate them to your domain endpoint before removing the Product API.

## Realtime / Server Push

SpeedPy does not ship realtime infrastructure by default. For guidance on
choosing between long polling, SSE, WebSockets (Django Channels), and external
event buses, see the **Realtime Strategy** decision doc in
`speedpy-docs/docs/realtime.md`.

**Short version:** start with interval polling (`202 Accepted` + status URL) for
job/task progress — it works with the existing WSGI + Celery stack and requires
zero new dependencies. Graduate to SSE for streaming or lower latency. Adopt
WebSockets only when you have a concrete bidirectional use case.
