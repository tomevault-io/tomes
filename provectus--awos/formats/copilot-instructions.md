## What This Repo Is

This repo contains **two distinct things** that live side-by-side:

1. **The AWOS framework** — markdown files in `commands/`, `templates/`, `claude/`, `scripts/`, and `plugins/`. These are the actual product: AI-agent prompts, document templates, and a Claude Code plugin. They never execute as code in this repo; they get copied into a user's project.
2. **The installer** — JavaScript code in `src/` and `index.js` (entry point). Published to npm as `@provectusinc/awos` and runnable via either Node (`npx`) or Bun (`bunx`). Its only job is to copy framework files into a user's project. See `src/CLAUDE.md` for installer internals.

When working here, identify which layer your change touches. Editing a prompt under `commands/foo.md` is product work; editing `src/services/file-copier.js` is installer work.

## Critical Rule: Do Not Run the Installer Here

**Never run the installer inside this repo** — neither `npx @provectusinc/awos` / `npx ./index.js` nor `bunx @provectusinc/awos` / `bun index.js`. The installer creates `.awos/`, `.claude/`, and `context/` directories — running it here pollutes the source tree with copies of files that already exist as originals. To test installer changes, run it against a separate scratch project as described in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Common Commands

```sh
# Format check — CI-enforced quality gate (pick one runner):
npx prettier . --check
bunx prettier . --check
npx prettier --write .     # auto-format before committing
bunx prettier --write .

# Run the test suite (no npm deps; node --test built-in):
npm test                   # all four layers (markdown lint, installer, fixtures, engine)
npm run test:lint          # Layer 1 — static prompt linter
npm run test:installer     # Layer 2 — installer unit tests
npm run test:fixtures      # Layer 3 — fixture-project end-to-end
npm run test:coverage      # prints per-file coverage table for src/
npm run test:coverage:gate # fails if coverage drops below env thresholds
bun test --coverage tests/ # local cross-runtime coverage (Bun version)

# Behavioral / session-log E2E lives in the awos-qa repository
# (sibling to this one). See its README for how to run.

# Test installer against a separate project (pick one runner; $AWOS_REPO is the absolute path to this repo):
cd ~/some-scratch-project
npx $AWOS_REPO/index.js
bunx $AWOS_REPO/index.js
bun $AWOS_REPO/index.js          # direct exec also works
npx $AWOS_REPO/index.js --dry-run   # preview only
```

The installer runs on **Node 22+ or any recent Bun**. It uses only standard JS built-ins (`fs`, `path`) via CommonJS `require`, which both runtimes support — do not add npm dependencies or runtime-specific APIs without strong justification, as that would break cross-runtime compatibility.

## Testing

The repo has a three-layer test suite under `tests/`, all built on Node's `node:test` built-in — no npm dependencies. See `tests/README.md` for the detailed reference.

1. **Static prompt linter** (`tests/lint-prompts.test.js`) — symmetry, frontmatter, marker presence, cross-references, dimension DAG, copy-table consistency, and grep-style checks for required substrings inside prompt bodies.
2. **Installer unit tests** (`tests/installer/*.test.js`) — exercises the installer services against temp directories.
3. **Fixture projects** (`tests/fixtures.test.js` + `tests/fixtures/<name>/`) — real installer runs against representative pre-install trees, with manifest-based assertions.

All three layers run in CI via `npm test`, which also runs the engine test layer (see "Running the engine tests" below).

### Coverage

`npm run test:coverage` runs the full suite under Node 22's built-in `--experimental-test-coverage` and prints a per-file table for `src/**` (the installer entry point `src/index.js` is excluded — it's just CLI plumbing). `npm run test:coverage:gate` adds three threshold flags that fail the run when coverage drops below the configured floor.

CI runs both: a non-blocking **coverage-report** job that just prints the table, and a **coverage-gate** job that enforces hardcoded thresholds. To raise the floor, edit `COVERAGE_LINES` / `COVERAGE_FUNCTIONS` / `COVERAGE_BRANCHES` in `.github/workflows/quality-check.yml`.

Local Bun fallback: `bun test --coverage tests/` produces an equivalent table (slightly different column set) when Node isn't installed.

Behavioral end-to-end tests — the ones that run a real Claude Code session against a seeded scratch project and assert on the actual tool-call trace — live in the separate **`awos-qa`** repository (sibling to this one). See its README for how to run them.

### Tests must narrate what they checked

Output that says `N events found` or `M pass` tells you the suite ran, not what was validated. `assert.*` failure messages should name the contract being violated, not just dump a diff. Anyone reading the test output should understand which contracts were verified without opening the test source.

### Adding tests for new contracts

When a change introduces a structural contract — frontmatter key, marker pattern, migration, copy-table entry — its test ships in the same PR. Surface-area contracts (something a grep can catch) go to Layer 1. Mechanical contracts (installer behavior, migration idempotency) go to Layer 2 or 3. Behavioral contracts ("Claude must actually call X") belong in the `awos-qa` repository.

## Architecture: The Two-Folder Customization Model

The installer copies files into **two destination folders** with different semantics — this is load-bearing for the whole UX:

| Source             | Destination              | Semantics                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `commands/`        | `.awos/commands/`        | Framework internals. Overwritten on every update.                       |
| `templates/`       | `.awos/templates/`       | Framework internals. Overwritten on every update.                       |
| `scripts/`         | `.awos/scripts/`         | Framework internals. Overwritten on every update.                       |
| `claude/commands/` | `.claude/commands/awos/` | Thin wrappers. User-editable customization layer — preserved on update. |

Each file in `claude/commands/{name}.md` is a tiny wrapper that points at `.awos/commands/{name}.md`. Users add custom instructions in the wrapper without losing them on update. When you add a new command, you must add both the full prompt in `commands/` AND a wrapper in `claude/commands/`. The copy table is defined in `src/config/setup-config.js`.

**Wrapper-preservation policy.** The `claude/commands` copy operation is marked `preserveOnUpdate: true`. On every install, the file-copier scans `.claude/commands/awos/` for files that already exist and would be clobbered. If any conflicts are found, the installer asks the user before overwriting; opting out leaves the existing wrappers untouched, while wrappers the user has never had (e.g. newly added commands) are still installed. Non-interactive runs (CI, piped, tests) default to **preserve** — silent overwrite of customizations is the bug this policy exists to prevent. CI/scripts that genuinely want a fresh sync can pass `--overwrite`; `--no-overwrite` is the explicit form of the safe default. Users who decline overwrite see a pointer to <https://github.com/provectus/awos/tree/main/claude/commands> for manual diffing.

## Architecture: Document-Centric Workflow

AWOS is **spec-driven** — all project state lives in markdown files under `context/` in the user's project, not in chat history. An AI agent can rehydrate full context by reading the files alone.

**Brownfield projects** get automatic codebase awareness and external documentation gathering. `/awos:product` detects existing source code (during Creation Mode only) and creates `context/product/brownfield.md` with triaged findings about purpose, audience, and features. It also detects external documentation sources (wikis, ticket systems, chats, email) by invoking the `configure-external-sources` plugin skill, which guides MCP/CLI tool setup and writes structured source configuration to `context/sources/sources.md`. If MCP setup requires an editor restart, the skill writes a partial config and resumes automatically on re-run. `/awos:roadmap` and `/awos:architecture` read the brownfield file and the sources config, running their own focused explorations and retrievals (capabilities and tech stack respectively), passing prior findings to avoid duplicate questions. All findings are triaged with the user (accept / correct / reject). `/awos:architecture` removes `brownfield.md`, and removes `context/sources/` once its contents are fully absorbed — otherwise keeps `sources.md` and references it from `product-definition.md`.

The canonical flow (each command is a markdown prompt under `commands/`):

```
/awos:product → /awos:roadmap → /awos:architecture → /awos:hire
              → /awos:spec → /awos:tech → /awos:tasks → /awos:implement → /awos:verify
```

The first four are run once at project setup; the last five iterate per feature. Each command reads/writes a specific document under `context/` (e.g. `context/product/product-definition.md`, `context/spec/NNN-feature/tasks.md`). The numeric prefix on spec directories is allocated by `scripts/create-spec-directory.sh`.

**Implementation delegation rule:** `/awos:implement` is an orchestrator only — it reads `tasks.md`, extracts the `**[Agent: name]**` marker from each task, and delegates to a subagent. The orchestrator is explicitly prohibited from editing code itself. Preserve this contract when editing `commands/implement.md`.

## Architecture: Installer Pipeline

`src/core/setup-orchestrator.js` runs six numbered steps: init → create directories → run migrations → copy files → configure MCP → register plugin marketplace. Each step lives in its own service module under `src/services/`. The orchestrator and `setup-config.js` are the two files to touch when changing setup behavior.

## Migrations

The installer can restructure existing user projects between versions. Migration files are JSON in `src/migrations/NNN-name.json`, executed in version order. Each declares `preconditions` (`require_any`, `require_all`, `skip_if_any`, `error_if_any`) and `operations` (`move`, `copy`, `delete`). The current version is stored in `.awos/.migration-version` in the user's project.

Always validate new migrations with `--dry-run` and ensure they are idempotent (re-running must be a no-op). Use `skip_if_any` to short-circuit when the migration has already been applied. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the migration schema.

## The Audit Plugin

`plugins/awos/` is a Claude Code plugin that adds the `/awos:ai-readiness-audit` command. The marketplace is declared in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at the repo root, and the installer registers it in the user's settings during setup (`src/services/marketplace-configurator.js`).

Each audit dimension is a standalone `.md` file in `plugins/awos/skills/ai-readiness-audit/dimensions/` defining its checks and their `standards.toml` category codes. Scoring runs deterministically in the engine, not via a per-dimension subagent fan-out: the orchestrator invokes one command — `node dist/cli.js audit-core <repo> <out>` — which evaluates project-topology first (computing the flags that gate other categories' `applies_when`), then every `detected`/`computed` category across all dimensions in a single pass, writing each `<dimension>.json` plus the aggregated `audit.json`. Only the handful of `judgment` categories and the connector-backed metrics are left for the orchestrator's LLM patch step. Adding a dimension touches four places: the dimension `.md` file, its category records in `standards.toml` (each with a required `check_id`, plus `meta.dimension_order`), a `detectors/<slug>.ts` module, and one import + spread in `detectors/index.ts` (metrics likewise register in `metrics/index.ts`).

The repo has **two independent version lines**. The npm installer version is managed by release-drafter via PR labels — never bump it manually. The **plugin version** is manual: when plugin behavior changes, bump it as one deliberate commit moving three files together — `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `plugins/awos/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and the `EXPECTED_PLUGIN_VERSION` pin in `tests/lint-prompts.test.js` (the lint exists to force exactly this three-file discipline). The engine stamps the plugin version into `audit.json` provenance and the report footer, so a behavior change shipped without a bump mislabels its audits.

### Measurement engine (TypeScript)

Scoring is additive and weighted, not A–F/0–100. Each capability **category** lives in `references/standards.toml` (numeric code, weight, definition, applicability, source bands); a dimension's score is the sum of weights for present-and-applicable categories, the audit total is the sum across dimensions, and nothing is capped. A secondary **coverage ratio** (awarded ÷ currently-defined applicable weight) is shown for intuition, and each metric carries a per-run **reliability** tag (`minimal`/`maximal`/`not-reliable` + confidence) computed from which sources were available.

The deterministic compute is a **TypeScript engine** under `plugins/awos/skills/ai-readiness-audit/`. Layers:

- `collectors/*.ts` — one per source (`git`, `ci`, `tracker`, `docs`); each queries its source once and emits a shared JSON artifact. Git is always available; absent sources SKIP with a reason.
- `detectors/*.ts` and `metrics/*.ts` — compute purely from collector artifacts and map to `standards.toml` categories. Complexity/scale metrics parse source with bundled tree-sitter `.wasm` grammars.
- `cli.ts` — the single dispatcher (`progress`/`render`/`rollup`/`audit-core`/`patch-judgment`/`report-context`/`patch-report`/`aggregate`/`enrich`). `render --format both --out-dir <dir>` writes `report.md` + `report.html` in one invocation.
- `audit_core.ts` — the one-pass deterministic audit: runs every `detected`/`computed` category across all dimensions, emits `judgment` checks as `PENDING_JUDGMENT` and connector metrics as `SKIP`, and writes the per-dimension JSON + `audit.json`. Connector topology flags (`has_tracker`/`has_docs_connector`/`has_incident_source`) are derived from the collected artifacts' availability. `enrich <repo> <outDir>` re-runs `auditCore` against the already-written `collected/` dir (via a `collectedDirOverride`, so it never re-collects/overwrites connector artifacts) — the orchestrator calls it once after fetching connectors to re-score every connector metric in a single pass instead of one `metric <id>` spawn per source; repo-derived checks (detectors, AST metrics) are reused from the per-dimension artifacts on disk rather than recomputed, so enrich costs a fraction of the initial pass. The post-audit patch verbs (`aggregate`, `patch-judgment`, `patch-report`, `report-context`) live in `audit_patch.ts`. `patch-judgment <dir> <verdicts.json>` applies the orchestrator's judgment verdicts to the per-dimension files and re-aggregates `audit.json` itself; `report-context <dir>` dumps the flattened authoring context (check values/hints, git window stats, tracker fetch meta) and `patch-report <dir> <blocks.json>` merges the orchestrator-authored headline/insights/recommendations into `audit.json` and emits `recommendations.md` from the same array, so the orchestrator never reads or edits a scoring artifact directly (the `audit-core`/`enrich` summary also lists `pending_judgment_checks`); the standalone `aggregate <dir>` verb (re-sum `audit.json` from the per-dimension files, preserving report blocks) is a repair tool, not part of the normal flow.
- `prevention.ts` — the prevention-coverage linkage pass: derives the per-cluster tier view (`enforced`/`instructed`/`absent`/`pending`) from the PRV check pairs, annotates covered source-dimension checks, and emits the `audit.prevention` block (audit.json only; per-dimension files stay raw). Pure over dimension objects; recomputed by both `audit-core` and `aggregate` (never preserved), which is how `pending` tiers finalize after `patch-judgment`. The PRV check records are self-describing (`cluster`/`covers_checks` stamped from standards.toml), so no standards access is needed post-audit.
- `topology.ts` — deterministic project-topology flags (file/grep heuristics) that gate `applies_when`; connector-dependent flags default absent until a connector is fetched.
- `render.ts` — deterministic JSON → Markdown/HTML renderer (single-repo + hash-routed drill-down report with org and per-repo sections); `report.md`/`report.html` are rendered from the JSON source of truth, never hand-written.
- `progress.ts` — pure progress/ETA helper (wall-clock, user-wait excluded).

The engine is bundled by `tools/ai-readiness-audit/build-engine.mjs` into `dist/cli.js` (esbuild, all imports inlined) plus `dist/grammars/*.wasm`. **`dist/` is committed and shipped** — users run the prebuilt `dist/cli.js`; they do not build. So after editing any engine `.ts`, run `npm run build:audit-engine` and commit the regenerated `dist/`. CI rebuilds and runs `git diff --exit-code` on `dist/` to flag a stale committed bundle — the job is currently `continue-on-error: true` (non-blocking until it has proven stable), so a stale `dist/` shows as a failed check without blocking the merge. The bundle is minified; `dist/`'s bulk is the ~26 MB of tree-sitter grammar `.wasm` files, which are required for multi-language complexity parsing and are intentionally shipped, not stripped.

At audit runtime `SKILL.md` orchestrates: Step 0 discovers repos (single-repo or org mode) and confirms scope with one `AskUserQuestion` whose **headless default** proceeds on the auto-discovered set (no prompt needed); Step 4 runs the single `node "$ENGINE" audit-core …` pass (no per-dimension subagents); Step 5 fills only the LLM-only slice — it fetches the reachable connector sources concurrently, re-scores them in one `enrich` pass, then patches the 13 `judgment` categories (5 source-dimension rubrics plus the 8 prevention-coverage instruction checks, which share one instruction-file corpus and ride one subagent), re-aggregates, authors the report blocks into `audit.json`, and renders both reports in one `render --format both` call. Each run writes to a fresh timestamped `context/audits/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS/` directory — audits are independent snapshots; there is no previous-audit or delta logic. In **org mode** the per-repo audits are dispatched as concurrent `awos:repo-auditor` subagents (one per repo, `plugins/awos/agents/repo-auditor.md`), each running the full single-repo flow into its own `per-repo/<repo>/` subdir, before the org `rollup`. The engine runs under any `node` on PATH, so it requires a Node runtime present — `SKILL.md` preflights `command -v node`. **Engine-skip circuit-breaker:** under headless `claude -p`, the orchestrator model has repeatedly tried to skip `audit-core` and hand-compute the audit (the reversion that retired the old `dimension-auditor` fan-out). Three layers prevent it: `SKILL.md` Step 4 is unconditional — the `audit-core` call is the first scoring action, and there is deliberately no load-time injection or other "maybe it already ran" mechanism to cite; the engine enforces provenance — `audit-core` stamps `audit.json` (and each dimension JSON) with `engine.generated_by`, and `patch-judgment`/`render` refuse an unstamped single-repo audit while `rollup` skips unstamped per-repo audits, so a hand-assembled audit cannot become a report; and the QA harness (`tools/ai-readiness-audit/qa/`) guards compliance, retries with a corrective `--append-system-prompt`, and seeds `audit-core` itself to salvage a non-compliant run.

Run headless against a target repo: `claude -p "/awos:ai-readiness-audit" --output-format stream-json --verbose`. Progress is coarse — the deterministic scoring is one `audit-core` pass — and is emitted via `node "$ENGINE" progress <elapsed> <done> <total>` (a `pct`/`eta_seconds` line, also a stream-json line in headless mode); the always-available fallback is counting completed `.json` artifacts in `context/audits/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS/` against the total.

### Running the engine tests

The engine has its own test layer (`plugins/awos/skills/ai-readiness-audit/**/*.test.ts`), run with Node's `node:test` + `tsx`. The files split by intent: the skill's `tests/` directory holds the structural suites (one per layer/verb), while `*.test.ts` files co-located with the modules (skill root, `detectors/`, `metrics/`) are issue-fix regression tests pinned to specific bugs. These need dev dependencies, so `npm ci` first (the markdown/installer layers have no deps, the engine layer does):

```sh
npm ci                 # installs tsx, esbuild, typescript, etc.
npm run build:audit-engine   # regenerate dist/ (required if any engine .ts changed)
npm run test:audit-engine    # node --import tsx --test over the engine test files
npm test               # full suite: markdown/installer layers + test:audit-engine
```

These commands assume `node`/`npm` resolve to a real Node toolchain (as on CI and a fresh clone), since the engine layer relies on `node:test`.

## Conventions

- Framework files are markdown. Treat them as prompts: clarity, structure, and explicit role/task/process sections matter more than terseness.
- Templates use `[bracketed placeholders]` for sections users fill in.
- Spec directories are numbered (`001-feature-name/`) to enforce ordering.
- Prettier config: single quotes, semicolons, 80-col, 2-space, LF endings, `es5` trailing commas. CI fails on format drift.
- PR labels (`major` / `minor` / `patch`) drive automated release version bumps via release-drafter; defaulting to `patch` when unlabeled.

## Editing Prompts

Files under `commands/`, `claude/commands/`, `plugins/awos/`, and `templates/agent-template.md` are prompts. Re-read Anthropic's guidance before any large rewrite — it changes:

- <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices>
- <https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices>
- <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands>
- <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents>

Non-obvious rules for this repo:

- **Dial back aggressive emphasis.** Opus 4.6+ overtriggers on `CRITICAL` / `YOU MUST` / `STRICTLY PROHIBITED`. Use plain declarative sentences; reserve one bold-emphasis rule per file for the one most likely to be ignored.
- **Use `Agent`, not `Task`,** when naming the delegation tool. `Task(...)` aliases still work but the tool was renamed in Claude Code v2.1.63.
- **Both project-local and plugin-provided agents surface in the `Agent` tool's description block at runtime.** Project-local agents come from `.claude/agents/*.md`; plugin-provided ones are recognized by the `plugin-name:` prefix on `subagent_type` (e.g. `python-development:python-pro`). For commands that only need to know what specialists exist and what each covers (e.g. `commands/tasks.md`, `commands/tech.md`), introspect the description block — no tool calls needed, no asymmetry between the two kinds. Read `.claude/agents/*.md` directly only when the command actually consumes the file contents beyond `name` + `description` — e.g. `commands/hire.md`, which reads `skills:` arrays to build its coverage table and appends to them when installing new skills.
- **Don't gratuitously name "Claude Code" inside prompts.** The host is already implied by paths (`.claude/agents/*.md`), conventions (the `plugin-name:` prefix on `subagent_type`), and tool names (`Agent` / `Read` / `Glob`). Explicit "loaded by Claude Code" / "in Claude Code" attributions in the prompt body almost always just trim.
- **Prefer the built-in `Explore` and `Plan` subagents** for read-heavy context-gathering. Don't have an orchestrator command read the whole codebase in its own context.
- **Skip ceremonial preambles** like "Great!", "I will now…", "All done!" — modern models trim them naturally and AWOS prompts shouldn't fight that.
- **`AskUserQuestion` belongs in core `commands/*.md`** under an `# INTERACTION` section. AWOS targets Claude Code only, so the tool is a framework default rather than a host-specific customization — don't duplicate it into the `claude/commands/*.md` wrappers.
- **Prefer `AskUserQuestion` over plain prose for every fixed-choice ask, not just the interview.** The `# INTERACTION` bullet ("instead of plain text or numbered lists") states the rule, but it's easy to break in the `PROCESS` body: "list the spec directories and ask the user to choose" is a numbered-list question wearing prose, and a proceed/stop or keep/drop/merge decision is a two-to-three-option `AskUserQuestion`, not a sentence. `flow.md` is the reference — its interview, re-run reconciliation, and reuse tradeoffs are all `AskUserQuestion` calls. Reserve plain prose for interactions with no discrete options to enumerate: a hard stop with a single next action, a non-blocking recommendation the command then proceeds past, or open-ended "review this and tell me what to change".
- **Do not hard-wrap markdown prose at 80 columns.** Let paragraphs and list items flow as a single line per logical unit. Markdown renderers reflow soft-wrapped text, and 80-col wrapping inflates diffs when prose is edited. Wrapping is fine only where the line is semantically a single token (a URL, a code identifier) or inside a fenced block whose literal line breaks matter.
