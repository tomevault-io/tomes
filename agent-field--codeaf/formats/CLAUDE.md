# Working in this repo

## The name

The product is `codeaf`, lowercase, and has had that one spelling since
2026-09-14 — sentence starts, titles, release names, the wordmark and `--help`
included. `CodeAF`, `Codeaf` and `CODEAF` outside an environment variable's name
are not spellings of it.

`internal/namelaw` is the gate. It reads every Go source under `cmd`, `internal`
and `bench`, the build and workflow and script surfaces, both manual corpora,
the session prompts and the documents an agent is pointed at, and it fails the
pull request naming the file and the line that brought a retired spelling back.

## The old name, and the three places it is still allowed

codeaf was called `aforge` until 2026-09-14, in a repository named `aforge-v2`;
`openaf` was a planned name that never shipped and never named a release. A
memory older than that date will spell both, and so will a machine that has been
running this program for a while.

Three places may still say them, and nothing else may:

- **The record.** `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/changes/`, `docs/design/`, the captured
  screen frames, `bench-results/`, `audit-notes/` and everything under a
  `testdata` directory say what was true on the day they were written.
- **The compatibility seams.** On first start codeaf tries to adopt `~/.aforge`
  into `~/.codeaf` and leave a link behind; if the move itself fails, it carries
  on reading the old folder. An `AFORGE_*` variable is still read when its
  `CODEAF_*` spelling is unset or empty, and `.aforge-v3/config.json` in a
  repository is still read. Persisted and on-the-wire identifiers permanently
  keep their former bytes so old and new builds continue to communicate. Every line
  that has to spell the old name for one of those reasons carries the marker
  comment `legacy-name`, which is the ONLY way a live Go or shell line is
  allowed to say it.
- **The one page that explains it.** A Markdown section whose `## ` heading
  contains the words *old name* — `internal/manual/chat/starting-codeaf.md` has
  it — is where a person who asks "what happened to aforge?" is answered.

A `CodeAF` in this org's Slack and benchmarks is a DIFFERENT PROGRAM (the
swe-pro coding harness, whose variables carry `KNOB`); ours never do.

## Which surface is which

One chat surface lives here, beside the resident that shares its binary and the
component library it draws with. Getting this wrong wastes a whole recon pass, so check
before you read.

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `internal/tui3` | **v3 — the live surface.** Entry `cmd/codeaf/chatv3.go`. Bare `codeaf` and `codeaf chat` both open it. |
| `internal/session` | **the v3 engine** — the agent, the turn loop, the toolbelt, tasks. |
| `internal/tui2` | REMOVED as a surface on 2026-08-31, and its compositor, its `blocks` engine and its model picker followed. What remains (`tokens`, `prose`, `reltime`, and `modelui`'s model words) is the shared component library v3 draws with. |
| `internal/head`, `internal/resident` | the v1 **resident** — a different product in the same binary. |

v3 is a **session you sit in front of**. The resident is an employee that keeps working
while the terminal is closed. They share a repository and almost nothing else — do not
carry vocabulary or assumptions between them.

`docs/DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md` is the visual north star: restrained, dim telemetry, no borders.

## Branches — where work goes

`dev` is the trunk and the default branch. Five rules, and they are here rather
than only in `docs/rules/` because they are the ones that must never be looked up:

- **Branch off `dev`, and open the pull request against `dev`.** `main` is the
  release pointer, not a place feature work lands.
- **Never push directly to `dev`, `staging` or `main`, and never force-push any
  of the three.** Promotion is the deliberate fast-forward below.
- **`staging` and `main` move by fast-forward onto tested `dev` history** —
  `git push origin <sha>:staging`, then `git push origin <sha>:main`, never a merge.
  `staging` moves by itself every Friday at the Toronto 17:00 cutoff through
  Promote to staging; a person still moves `main`.
- **Pushes publish channel builds.** `dev` and `staging` publish their named
  channels; `main` publishes an rc. A person cuts stable by dispatching `Release`
  on `main`. The workflow refuses rc or stable commits not already on `staging`,
  and staging commits not already on `dev`.
- **Every pull request carries a change entry** in `docs/changes/unreleased/` —
  `make changelog-new PR=<n> KIND=<kind> SLUG=<slug>`, and the `check` job
  demands it.

The pull-request gate into `dev` is deliberately light — build, vet, the packed
corpora, the change entry, the manual law, a few minutes. The whole suite runs on the way into
`staging` and nightly against `dev`. So **`dev` is where things are allowed to be
briefly wrong**, which is the trade that keeps it fast, and the reason a commit
soaks on `dev` for a couple of days before anyone promotes it.

**AND IF YOUR MEMORY OF THIS REPOSITORY IS OLDER THAN A FEW DAYS, READ
`docs/changes/unreleased/` BEFORE ACTING ON IT.** That is what those entries are
for, and it is the one thing `git log` cannot tell you. They do not say what
shipped; they say what somebody now believes **wrongly** — the branch that
stopped existing, the default that moved, the refusal that became a capability.
This has cost real hours: this file ordered work pushed to `origin chat-v3-task`
for days after that branch stopped existing, and `generate_image` was documented
as impossible right up until the wave that shipped it. In both cases the code was
right, the tests were green, and what was wrong was what somebody remembered.

```sh
grep -rn 'invalidates' -A6 docs/changes/unreleased/    # everything that moved
grep -rln 'surface:.*chat' docs/changes/unreleased/    # only the v3 surface
```

When you land a change, write yours the same way: what was true, and what is true
now. `docs/rules/changelog.md` says why it cannot be generated from the diff.

Read on demand, not up front: [docs/rules/branching.md](docs/rules/branching.md)
for the model and why promotion is a fast-forward,
[docs/rules/ci.md](docs/rules/ci.md) for what runs where and the known-red ledger
in `.github/known-red.txt`, [docs/rules/changelog.md](docs/rules/changelog.md)
for what an entry carries, [docs/rules/promotion.md](docs/rules/promotion.md)
for the promote-and-release runbook.

Server enforcement depends on the repository's visibility or plan — the org is
on the free plan, and a private repository gets no branch rules there. Until the
org moves to GitHub Team or the repository is public, every line above is
convention. `.github/rulesets/` holds the rules ready to apply.

## Build and ship — the owner's standing orders

- **Always build with `make build`**, which writes `bin/codeaf`. Never a bare
  `go build -o` to some other path: `bin/codeaf` is the ONE binary the owner
  runs, and every stray copy becomes a shadow that rolls them back silently
  (the root `./codeaf` did it once, `~/.agentfield/bin/codeaf` did it again on
  2026-08-24 — if a shipped feature "stopped working", run `which -a codeaf`
  and `shasum` before debugging anything).
- Rebuild after every merge. Never `cp` over a binary that may be running —
  `rm` first, then install — or the next launch dies with `Killed: 9`.
- **Finished work is pushed and opened as a pull request against `dev`** in the
  same wave — never left sitting on a local branch or an unpushed worktree. If
  the shared checkout is dirty with another session's work, push through a
  temporary detached worktree (`git worktree add --detach … origin/dev`) rather
  than touching their tree. (`chat-v3-task` was the trunk until 2026-08-31 and no
  longer exists; anything still naming it is stale.)

**Before opening a pull request on this laptop, run `make pr-ready`.** That is
the light gate plus fresh tests for the Go packages changed from `origin/dev`
(or `BASE=<commit>`). It is the same bar CI uses to merge into `dev`. Do **not**
run `make check`, bare `go test ./...`, or a full `go test ./internal/tui3` /
`./internal/session` as the merge ritual — those thrash the box and are not what
the pull-request gate demands. Edit with `make test-focus`; prove the change
with `make test-touched` or `make pr-ready`. `make check` remains the full-tree
build, test and size ritual for Spark, staging, or an intentional full laptop
run. Concurrent full runs of `tui3` or `session` share one per-box lock so two
agents cannot stack those binaries. The performance laws those targets enforce —
and the rule that changing any cap changes the doc in the same commit — are in
[PERF.md](PERF.md).

`make demo-home` builds a **throwaway home with something on every place** — three
projects, twelve conversations, standing orders, memories, a fourteen-day spending
ledger — and opens `bin/codeaf` against it with `HOME` pointed there. Use it when you
want to SEE a page full: on a machine that has just started using codeaf the standing,
memory and spend pages correctly draw nothing, which is indistinguishable from a page
that is broken. It never touches `~/.codeaf`. The seeder is `cmd/codeaf-demo-home` and
`docs/design/home-rethink/HANDOFF.md` says what is in the fixture and how to add to it.

```sh
make demo-home                                       # a fresh one, in a temp directory
make demo-home DEMO_HOME=/tmp/codeaf-demo            # somewhere you can name
make demo-home DEMO_HOME=/tmp/codeaf-demo KEEP=1     # open the one that is already there
```

## THE MANUAL LAW — a feature is not done until the manual knows about it

`internal/manual/chat/` is v3's own account of itself, compiled into the binary. The
running chat reads it with the `manual` tool to answer "what can you do?", "what does this
key do?", "why did you just do that?". It is the **only** authoritative source about
codeaf for the model: its training data does not contain this program, so anything not in
those pages is something the chat will either improvise or deny having.

**So: if you add, change, or remove a feature, you update the pages in the same change.**
That means a new slash command, a new key, a new tool on the belt, a changed default, a
new limit, a refusal whose wording changed. Not a follow-up task — the same change.

Three gates fail the build if you forget:

| Gate | What it demands |
| --- | --- |
| `internal/tui3/manual_test.go` | every slash command **and every alias**, spelled with its leading slash, appears somewhere in the corpus |
| `internal/session/manual_test.go` | every tool on the belt appears by its exact registered name |
| `internal/manual/chat_test.go` | every probe in its table — real questions in a person's own words (over a hundred by now) — still reaches the page that answers it |

The failure message names the exact missing string.

The corpus ships **packed** — `make build` generates ignored
`internal/manual/{pages,chat}.pack.gz` artifacts from the folders and selects them for the
release binary (see `internal/packed`). Edit and commit only the Markdown. Ordinary
`go build`/`go test` embed that Markdown directly so a clean checkout works without generated
files; `make test-packed-manual` exercises the compressed path the shipped binary uses.

**When a question reaches the wrong page, fix the page, never the test.** Write the
asker's vocabulary into a `## ` heading — people search for "saved" where a writer wrote
"kept", for "delete a file" where a writer wrote "write". Retrieval is the feature; a page
that is complete, correct and unreachable is a page the chat talks over the top of.

Rules for the pages themselves:

- `# Title` once at the top; every topic gets its own `## ` heading, because headings are
  the search index. Keep each section under ~2000 characters and **self-contained** — it
  gets retrieved and read with none of its neighbours.
- Write what the code does, not what a design doc intends. Quote person-facing strings
  exactly as the code spells them.
- **State limits and refusals.** Someone asking the manual usually wants to know whether
  something is possible; "no, and here is what it says instead" is the most useful answer
  on the page. Never describe half-built machinery as though it worked.
- **When you make something possible, hunt down the page that says it isn't.** The gates
  check that a name is *mentioned*, never that the claim around it is true — a tool named
  in a "what codeaf cannot do" section satisfies them perfectly while lying. So a lane that
  lands a capability greps the corpus for the old denial and removes it in the same change.
  `generate_image` was documented as impossible right up until the wave that shipped it.
- The chat's corpus may not use resident vocabulary (`alt+1`, the board, the self page,
  standing watches, front desk). A test enforces this.

The resident's own pages are `internal/manual/pages/` and are a **separate corpus** — the
two cannot reach each other, and a page name may not exist in both.

Also true and easy to forget: `internal/session/prompts/system.md` is what the model is
told it can do. If a tool is conditional or absent, the prompt must not promise it. It has
been wrong before — it advertised `note`/`forget` (which need a `Config.MemoryFile` that
no door sets) and claimed `read` lists directories (it is `os.ReadFile`; a directory is an
error).

## Design laws the codebase enforces

Violations get rejected in review, and some are pinned by tests.

- **The emptiness law.** Unknown or zero renders as *nothing* — never `$0.00`, never
  `0 tok`. (Two deliberate exceptions: the live status line keeps `$0.00` so its segments
  do not jump sideways, and `/status` and `/cost` drop the line; and a home PANEL with
  nothing in it keeps its heading and one dim line naming what arrives there — never
  a sentence saying it is empty — docs/design/home-mission-control/DESIGN.md §4.)
- **No machinery vocabulary in anything a person reads.** `auditor`, `verdict`,
  `verified`, `refuted` are banned. Work is *running*, *finishing*, *done*, *incomplete*,
  or *your call*. (`needs your look`, `awaiting review` and `unverified` were the old
  spellings of that last one and are deleted — docs/design/task-states/DESIGN.md.)
- **A capability that cannot work is absent, not broken.** A tool with nothing behind it
  is left off the belt entirely, so the model does not have the verb — rather than
  present and failing every time it is called. `memoryTools` and the remote harness
  designer are both written this way.
- **Comments are full-sentence prose** stating the *why*, with ALL-CAPS for a stated law.
  Match the surrounding density; this codebase comments heavily and deliberately.
- **Every icon comes from the vocabulary, through its one door — in EVERY surface
  package.** `internal/tui2/tokens` holds every mark a person sees — task states, the step
  gutter's action families, file kinds, chrome — each a slot with three spellings (a Font
  Awesome 4 icon, the geometric floor, one ASCII character for a screen reader), resolved by
  `tokens.GlyphSet.Glyph(id)` and reached from the surface through `palette.glyph` /
  `app.icon` in `internal/tui3`. A mark spelled as a literal draws the plain floor forever,
  because a literal cannot know which repertoire the terminal is on. One terminal shows ONE
  tier everywhere: every surface folds the Display row (`step icons`) over
  `tokens.DetectGlyphSet` the same way. `internal/iconlaw` walks `internal/tui3`,
  `internal/head` and `internal/resident` and fails the build on one, on every pull request;
  [docs/design/icons/DESIGN.md](docs/design/icons/DESIGN.md) is the law and the table.
- **One source of truth.** A number that appears in two places will drift — interpolate it
  from the constant. `propose_task`'s schema said the step default was 40 while the
  executor applied 200, and every model that read it reasoned from the wrong figure.

## Working alongside other sessions

Several Claude sessions often work this repo at once, in the same working tree.

- **Never `git add -A` or `git add .`** — stage your own explicit paths. It is easy to
  sweep another lane's in-flight untracked files into your commit.
- Run `ListAgents` before assuming whose work something is.
- Re-run `go build ./...` after fetching: another lane's half-finished file can break the
  tree for everyone.
- **Proof must be robust and must not waste the box.** Prefer `test-focus` while
  editing and `pr-ready` before the pull request. Do not stack full heavy-package
  suites beside another agent; if the suite lock refuses, wait or keep using
  `test-focus` rather than starting a second `tui3`/`session` compile.
- Feature waves are built in git worktrees off `dev` (`git worktree add
  ~/af-<name> -b <branch> origin/dev`), land through a pull request, then the
  worktrees and branches are removed. GitHub deletes the remote branch on merge.

## Filing an issue

`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/defect.md` is the shape, and two of its lines are the law.
**The replication is something a stranger can run** — a stub, a fixture, a `-tags e2e`
run — never a path on your machine: #185's evidence lived in a private store on a
benchmark box nobody else can reach, which left a real bug unactionable. **The
acceptance is end-to-end first**, naming the real door and the exact string or receipt
field asserted — the TUI e2e suite was unit-green and e2e-broken for a week (#184).
#185 and #207 are the worked examples. Blank issues stay enabled: most of what is filed
here is a proposal, and the template is for defects.

## Tests

The 2026-09-08 constrained-runner baseline (`GOMAXPROCS=4`, `GOFLAGS=-p=2`) put
`internal/tui3` at 563 seconds and `internal/session` at 210 seconds. Heavy
packages run sharded through `make test`; use `SHARDS=1` to reproduce the serial
outcome. Give each shard `-timeout 15m`, never `8m`, or the ceiling can report
whichever test happened to be running as though it hung. Use the repository
targets for shorter loops:

```sh
make test-focus PKGS=./internal/tui3 RUN='^TestTheRegression$$' # one named test
make test-touched                                              # fresh changed-package proof
make test-quick                                                # light feedback, not acceptance
make pr-ready                                                  # local pull-request parity
make test-report PKGS=./internal/tui3 REPORT=/tmp/tui3.json    # fresh tests, timings and progress
```

`make test-report` keeps Go's build cache but supplies `-count=1`, so test
results are fresh. Its JSON distinguishes cached packages, lists incomplete
packages after an abrupt end, and sorts completed tests slowest-first; a cut run
still writes that report and still exits non-zero. The quick target checks build,
vet, formatting, the packed manual, well-formed change entries, the manual gates,
and laws; it does not replace acceptance. `make test-touched` derives the same
package set as the pull-request gate and runs it through the known-red ledger with `-count=1`;
`make pr-ready` combines that proof with the light gate. Pass `BASE=<commit>`
when the comparison should not be `origin/dev`. The target refuses uncommitted
Go or module files: commit the candidate first so the local diff is exactly the
diff CI will test, without absorbing another session's edits.

**The tests that fail on a clean tree are listed in `.github/known-red.txt` and
nowhere else.** `make test` skips them by name, and so does CI, through the same
target — so `make check` passes on a clean tree and a red in either place means
the change caused it. The ledger only shrinks (`internal/ci` ratchets its count):
fix a test, delete its line, lower `knownRedEntries` in the same commit. Never
add a line. Confirm any other red with a stash-and-rerun before chasing it.

There is no longer a "flakes under load" list here. The three that were on it —
`TestOnlyADesignsOwnThreadCarriesTheReviseVerb`,
`TestInterruptedTurnDoesNotWakeOnTheNoteItDrained` and
`TestAChangeWithdrawsTheCardRewritesThePageAndAsksAgain` — shared one cause with
two more that were never written down, and it was fixed rather than described
(#176). A `internal/session` test that fails only when other suites are running
beside it is now a bug report, not a known shape: **reproduce it, do not rerun it
in isolation and move on.**

**The laws and the touched packages run on every pull request, and both block.**
`make test-laws` is every test that reads the tree itself with `go/ast` or
`go/parser`, found by that import (`scripts/laws.sh`) and run in about twenty
seconds; `touched packages` is the full suite of every package the change touched,
with `-count=1`; `check` is green only when both are. Write a structural test with
that import and it is on the gate the day it lands. A red `touched packages` on
your pull request is yours to read before anything merges.

**The tmux TUI suite** is the only test that drives the real binary in a real
terminal against a real model, and it is how a wave verifies that the surface
still behaves:

```sh
make test-e2e-tui                                              # TestTUIE2E alone, ~17m, 40m ceiling
make test-e2e                                                 # whole tagged package, 120m ceiling
go test -tags e2e -run TestTUIE2E -count=1 -timeout 40m -v ./internal/e2e/
```

It needs a provider key and `tmux`, costs a few cents. `TestTUIE2E` alone is
about **seventeen minutes** (most of it one subtest waiting out a five-minute
standing pass). The whole tagged package does not fit in forty minutes —
ManualOnTheWire, QuestionsE2E and the roomfeed twins run first and eat the
budget — so `make test-e2e` gives it two hours. It SKIPS
rather than fails with no key, no tmux or no `bin/codeaf`, so run `make build`
first. **The key is resolved the way the product resolves one** — `liveKey` in
`internal/e2e/livekey_test.go` goes through `config.APIKeyAt`, so
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` and the profile's own `api_key` row all
run the suite. Gating on the variable alone skipped on every machine whose key
was pasted into the first-run setup, and a skipped end-to-end suite reports
green without running (#576); the untagged
`TestEveryLaneAsksForItsKeyTheWayTheProductDoes` fails a lane that reads a key
variable itself. Iterate one subtest at a time — `-run 'TestTUIE2E/<name>'` — rather than
paying for the whole thing, and capture the output to a file: the screens it logs
are far too wide to read through a pipe.

Its needles all come out of one table, `internal/e2e/tuiwords_test.go`, which an
**untagged** test in the same package reads back against `internal/tui3`'s own
sources — so `go test ./internal/e2e/` (no tag, no model, under a second) fails
the moment the surface stops spelling a sentence the suite waits for. That gate
exists because the suite silently rotted for a week after the home redesign
(#184); if you respell a person-facing string, expect it to name you.

**The router's own laws** have one live-key test beside the fake-router suites,
because a claim about how many machines are behind a model is a claim about the
world and no fixture can answer it:

```sh
go test -tags e2e ./internal/provider/ -run TestRealRouter -v   # ~45s, a fraction of a cent
```

It thins a real serving set — striking every machine it sees answer until its own
vetoes cover all of them — and asserts the router refuses that at most once. On
2026-09-03 against `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` and its sixteen machines, dev
`713945e3b` paid 8 refusals over 36 calls and the fix paid 1 over 23 (#586). It
SKIPS green without `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; the package's `TestMain` re-roots
`CODEAF_HOME`, so the profile's key is not found and the variable is the way in.
`internal/lane` has the sibling live test, `-run TestReal`.

**Remote access** (`--host`, `--at`, attachments) has three layers, and they are cheap:

```sh
go test ./internal/remote/ ./internal/enginehost/ ./internal/pair/... ./internal/relay/ ./internal/furrow/
make test-remote          # three containers, no API key, ~50s; SKIPS GREEN with no docker
```

`make test-remote` builds its container binaries for **this machine's** architecture; an
`Exec format error` from `modelstub` means that pin was reintroduced. With no second
machine, `--host localhost` is a real connection over a real ssh pipe and exercises
everything except the shared-disk law — `docs/remote-access-testing.md` §3.0 has the tmux
recipe for driving the surface and killing the link on purpose.

## Learned User Preferences

- Keep designs and local verification robust without wasting laptop time or CPU: prefer deterministic clocks and focused/`pr-ready` paths over real sleeps or unconstrained full `internal/tui3` / `internal/session` suites on a shared box.

## Learned Workspace Facts

- Concurrent full runs of `internal/tui3` or `internal/session` (and full-tree `make test` / `test-report`) take the per-box lock in `scripts/one-suite.sh` and refuse instead of stacking; `make test-focus` and lighter checks stay unlocked.
