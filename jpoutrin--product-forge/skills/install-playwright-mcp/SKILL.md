# Install Playwright MCP Server

Install the Playwright MCP server to enable browser automation capabilities.

## What This Does

The Playwright MCP server provides:
- **Browser automation** - Navigate, click, fill forms, take screenshots
- **Accessibility snapshots** - LLM-friendly structured data, no vision models needed
- **Fast and lightweight** - Uses Playwright's accessibility tree

## Installation Command

Run this command to install:

```bash
claude mcp add playwright -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest
```

## Scope Options

- `--scope local` (default): Available only in current project
- `--scope project`: Shared with team via `.mcp.json`
- `--scope user`: Available across all your projects

```bash
# Install for user (all projects)
claude mcp add playwright --scope user -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest

# Install for project (team shared)
claude mcp add playwright --scope project -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest
```

## Headless Mode

For headless operation (no visible browser):

```bash
claude mcp add playwright -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest --headless
```

## Common Configurations

### With specific browser
```bash
claude mcp add playwright -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest --browser firefox
```

### With custom viewport
```bash
claude mcp add playwright -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest --viewport-size 1920x1080
```

### With isolated sessions (no persistence)

```

## Verify Installation
