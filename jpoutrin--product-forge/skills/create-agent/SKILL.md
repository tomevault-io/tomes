# Create Agent Skill

Create new Claude Code agents with proper configuration and structure.

## Agent File Format

Agents are markdown files in the `agents/` directory with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: Full description of what the agent does and when to use it
tools: Glob, Grep, Read, Write, Edit, Bash, WebFetch, WebSearch, TodoWrite
model: sonnet
color: green
---

# Agent Title

Agent prompt content goes here...
```

## Required Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `name` | Unique identifier (kebab-case) | `code-reviewer` |
| `description` | One-line summary of agent's purpose | `Reviews code for quality and best practices` |
| `tools` | Comma-separated list of available tools | `Glob, Grep, Read, Write, Edit, Bash` |
| `model` | Model to use: `opus`, `sonnet`, or `haiku` | `sonnet` |
| `color` | Status line color | `green`, `blue`, `purple`, `red`, `orange`, `cyan`, `magenta`, `yellow`, `pink`, `teal`, `violet` |

## Model Selection Guidelines

- **opus**: Strategic decisions, complex architecture, security-critical, compliance, executive-level analysis
- **sonnet**: Technical implementation, code writing, general development tasks (most common)
- **haiku**: Quick lookups, simple transformations, fast responses

## Available Tools

Common tool combinations by agent type:

### Code Development Agents
```
Glob, Grep, Read, Write, Edit, Bash, TodoWrite
```

### Research/Analysis Agents
```
Glob, Grep, Read, WebFetch, WebSearch, TodoWrite
```

### Full-Featured Agents
```
Glob, Grep, Read, Write, Edit, Bash, WebFetch, WebSearch, TodoWrite
```

## Creation Process

1. Determine the agent's purpose and expertise area
2. Choose appropriate model based on complexity
3. Select tools needed for the agent's tasks
4. Write clear, actionable agent prompt
5. Save to `plugins/<plugin-name>/agents/<agent-name>.md`

## Example Agent

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code changes for quality, security, and best practices. Use when user wants code reviewed, needs security audit, or asks about code quality.
tools: Glob, Grep, Read, TodoWrite
model: sonnet
color: yellow
---

# Code Reviewer Agent

You are an expert code reviewer focused on quality, security, and maintainability.

## Review Checklist

- Code correctness and logic
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance considerations
- Code style and consistency
- Test coverage
- Documentation

## Output Format

Provide structured feedback with:
1. Summary of changes
2. Issues found (categorized by severity)
3. Recommendations
4. Approval status
```
