# Git Commits Skill

This skill enforces git commit best practices and conventional commits format.

## Conventional Commits Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

## Commit Types

| Type | Description | Semver |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `feat` | New feature | MINOR |
| `fix` | Bug fix | PATCH |
| `docs` | Documentation only | - |
| `style` | Formatting, no code change | - |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring | - |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | PATCH |
| `test` | Adding tests | - |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks | - |
| `ci` | CI configuration | - |
| `build` | Build system changes | - |

## Examples

### Feature
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support

Implement OAuth2 flow with Google and GitHub providers.
Includes token refresh and secure storage.

Closes #123
```

### Bug Fix
```
fix(api): handle null response in user endpoint

The /users endpoint crashed when the database returned null.
Added proper null checking and error response.
```

### Breaking Change
```
feat(api)!: change response format for /users endpoint

BREAKING CHANGE: Response now returns array instead of object.
Migration guide available in docs/migrations/v2.md
```

## Atomic Commits

Each commit should:
1. Represent ONE logical change
2. Be independently revertible
3. Pass all tests
4. Be complete (not "WIP")

### Bad Example
```
git commit -m "Fix bugs and add features and update docs"
```

### Good Example
```
git commit -m "fix(auth): prevent session timeout on refresh"
git commit -m "feat(dashboard): add export to CSV button"
git commit -m "docs(api): update authentication examples"
```

## Commit Message Rules

1. **Type is required** and lowercase
2. **Description** starts lowercase, no period
3. **Imperative mood**: "add" not "added" or "adds"
4. **First line** under 72 characters
5. **Body** wraps at 72 characters
6. **Breaking changes** marked with `!` or footer
