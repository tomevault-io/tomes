# Sec-Context Depth: AI Code Security Anti-Patterns Review

## v2.90.1 Changes

- **References-driven**: Uses LOCAL reference files with full BAD/GOOD examples
- **Model-agnostic**: Works with any configured model
- **No flags required**: Works with the configured default model

Perform comprehensive security reviews on AI-generated code, detecting **27 security anti-patterns** from the sec-context framework.

> Based on: [Arcanum-Sec/sec-context](https://github.com/Arcanum-Sec/sec-context)
> Source: 150+ security research sources, OWASP, CWE

## MANDATORY: Load Reference Files First

**Before analyzing any code, you MUST read the local reference files** that contain the full detection patterns with BAD/GOOD examples:

1. **BREADTH reference** (comprehensive coverage of all 27 patterns):
   ```
   Read: .claude/skills/sec-context-depth/references/ANTI_PATTERNS_BREADTH.md
   ```

2. **DEPTH reference** (deep-dive into 7 most critical patterns):
   ```
   Read: .claude/skills/sec-context-depth/references/ANTI_PATTERNS_DEPTH.md
   ```

These files contain:
- Pseudocode BAD examples (what to detect)
- Pseudocode GOOD examples (secure alternatives)
- CWE identifiers and severity scores
- Attack scenarios and exploitation techniques
- Edge cases frequently overlooked by AI models

**Do NOT rely only on this SKILL.md** — the pattern titles below are an index only. The actual detection logic is in the reference files.

---

## Execution Steps

1. **Read** both reference files above
2. **Glob** target files: `Glob pattern="src/**/*.{ts,js,py,java,go}"` (adjust to target)
3. **Grep** for each anti-pattern using the BAD examples from references
4. **Report** findings organized by Priority (P0 → P2)

---

## Statistics (Why This Matters)

- **86% XSS failure rate** in AI-generated code
- **72% of Java AI code** contains vulnerabilities
- AI code is **2.74x more likely** to have XSS vulnerabilities
- **81% of organizations** have shipped vulnerable AI-generated code
- **5-21% of AI-suggested packages don't exist** (slopsquatting)

## Priority Classification

| Priority | Score | Action | Count |
|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| **P0 Critical** | 21-24 | BLOCKING - Must fix before merge | 13 patterns |
| **P1 High** | 18-20 | BLOCKING - Should fix before merge | 8 patterns |
| **P2 Medium** | 15-17 | ADVISORY - Review and fix if feasible | 6 patterns |

## Detection Checklist

When reviewing code, systematically check:

- [ ] **Secrets**: Environment variables, not hardcoded
- [ ] **Queries**: Parameterized, not concatenated
- [ ] **Commands**: Array arguments, shell=False
- [ ] **HTML**: textContent/sanitized, not innerHTML
- [ ] **Crypto**: Modern algorithms (AES-GCM, bcrypt)
- [ ] **Random**: Cryptographic sources
- [ ] **Files**: Path validation, secure temp
- [ ] **Errors**: Generic messages in production
- [ ] **Auth**: Session regeneration, rate limiting
