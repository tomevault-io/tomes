# Doc Validator

## Purpose

Scan the repository for Markdown files (`.md`) located outside of predefined, allowed directories. This skill helps prevent documentation sprawl and enforces a consistent repository structure by warning about `.md` files in non-standard locations.

## When to Use

Use this skill in the following situations:

- During code reviews to ensure documentation is properly organized
- As part of CI/CD quality checks
- Before merging changes that add new documentation
- When auditing the repository for documentation compliance
- Called automatically by other skills (issue-executor, change-integrator)

## Prerequisites

- Standard bash utilities (`find`, `bash`)
- Project follows AgenticDev directory conventions

## Workflow

### Step 1: Run the Validator

Execute the validator script to scan for misplaced Markdown files:

```bash
bash skills/doc-validator/scripts/doc-validator.sh
```

### Step 2: Review Warnings

The script outputs warnings for any `.md` files found in non-standard locations:

```
WARNING: Markdown file in non-standard location: ./src/notes.md
WARNING: Markdown file in non-standard location: ./scripts/temp-docs.md
```

### Step 3: Take Action

For each warning:

1. **Determine if the file should exist**: Is it temporary or abandoned?
2. **Move to proper location**: Relocate to `docs/` or appropriate skill directory
3. **Add to allowed patterns**: If it's a legitimate exception (update the script)
4. **Remove the file**: If it's no longer needed

## Allowed Patterns

The validator considers these locations as standard and will not warn about them:

- **Root-level documentation**: `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `AGENTS.md`, `RETROSPECTIVE.md`
- **Main docs directory**: `docs/**/*.md` (all subdirectories)
- **Skill documentation**:
  - `skills/*/SKILL.md`
  - `skills/*/references/*.md`
  - `skills/*/examples/*.md`
  - `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`
  - `.claude/skills/*/references/*.md`
  - `.claude/skills/*/examples/*.md`

## Error Handling

### False Positives

**Symptom**: The validator warns about a file that should be allowed

**Solution**:
- Check if the file matches an allowed pattern
- If it's a legitimate location not covered by current patterns, update `doc-validator.sh`
- Add the new pattern to the `ALLOWED_PATTERNS` array

### Script Not Finding Files

**Symptom**: The script runs but finds no files or fewer files than expected

**Solution**:
- Verify you're running from the repository root
- Check file permissions
- Ensure `.md` files exist in the repository

### Permission Denied

**Symptom**: Script cannot access certain directories

**Solution**:
- Check directory permissions
- Ensure the script is executable: `chmod +x skills/doc-validator/scripts/doc-validator.sh`

## Notes

- **Non-destructive**: The script only reports issues, it does not move or delete files
- **Excludes**: Automatically skips `.git/` and `.agenticdev-backup-*` directories
- **Integration**: Designed to be called by other skills as part of quality checks
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new allowed patterns by updating the script
- **CI-friendly**: Returns parsable output suitable for automated checks
