# Change Integrator Skill

## Purpose

Perform post-merge integration tasks after a code PR is successfully merged. This skill completes the development cycle by moving approved specs from `docs/changes/` to `docs/specs/`, updating the retrospective with learnings, cleaning up feature branches, and updating project board status. It ensures the repository remains clean and the documentation reflects the current state.

A key feature of this skill is the **automated maintenance of `RETROSPECTIVE.md`**. When the file grows too large, the script automatically uses the Gemini CLI to summarize older entries, keeping the document concise and readable while preserving key historical learnings.

## When to Use

Use this skill in the following situations:

- After a code PR is merged to main
- Completing a feature that had a spec proposal
- Finalizing a task and cleaning up branches
- Updating retrospective with completed work
- Moving approved specs to source-of-truth location

## Prerequisites

- Code PR has been merged to main branch
- Feature branch name is known
- PR number is known
- Project board item ID is known (if using project boards)
- `gh` CLI tool installed and authenticated
- `gemini` CLI tool installed and authenticated
- Currently on main branch with latest changes

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify PR is Merged

Before running integration, confirm the PR was successfully merged:

```bash
gh pr view PR_NUMBER --json state,mergedAt
```

Ensure the state is "MERGED" and mergedAt timestamp is populated.

### Step 2: Identify Integration Needs

Determine what needs to be integrated:
- **Spec files**: Was this a feature with a spec proposal in `docs/changes/`?
- **Branch cleanup**: What is the feature branch name?
- **Project board**: What is the item ID to mark as done?
- **Retrospective**: What were the key learnings from this task?

### Step 3: Run the Helper Script (Optional)

If using the automated script for integration:

```bash
bash scripts/integrate-change.sh -p PR_NUMBER -b BRANCH_NAME -i ITEM_ID -w "WENT_WELL" -l "LESSON" [-c CHANGE_DIR]
```

**Parameters**:
- `-p`: PR number that was merged
- `-b`: Feature branch name (e.g., `feat/45-restructure-doc-indexer`)
- `-i`: Project board item ID
- `-w`: A quote about what went well.
- `-l`: A quote about the key lesson learned.
- `-c`: Optional path to change proposal directory (e.g., `docs/changes/my-feature`)

### Step 4: Understand What the Script Does

The helper script automates these steps:

1.  **Verifies PR is merged**: Queries GitHub API and aborts if PR is not in MERGED state.
2.  **Switches to main and pulls**: Ensures work is on the latest main branch.
3.  **Deletes feature branch**: Removes both remote and local branches.
4.  **Integrates spec files (if applicable)**: Moves `spec-delta.md` to `docs/specs/` and commits the change.
5.  **Updates project board**: Sets the task status to "Done".
6.  **Updates retrospective**: Appends a new entry. If `RETROSPECTIVE.md` exceeds a line limit (e.g., 150 lines), it **automatically summarizes older sprint entries** using the Gemini CLI to keep the file manageable.
7.  **Pushes all changes**: Pushes integration commits to main.

### Step 5: Manual Integration (Alternative)

If not using the script, perform these steps manually:

#### 5a. Switch to Main and Update

```bash
git switch main
git pull
```

#### 5b. Delete Feature Branch

```bash
# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feat/45-restructure-doc-indexer

# Delete local branch
git branch -D feat/45-restructure-doc-indexor
```

#### 5c. Integrate Spec Files (If Applicable)

If the feature had a spec proposal:

```bash
# Identify the change directory
ls docs/changes/

# Move spec-delta to specs
SPEC_NAME="my-feature"
cp docs/changes/$SPEC_NAME/spec-delta.md docs/specs/$SPEC_NAME.md

# Remove change directory
rm -r docs/changes/$SPEC_NAME

# Commit integration
git add docs/
git commit -m "docs: Integrate approved spec from feat/45-my-feature"
```

#### 5d. Update Project Board

```bash
gh project item-edit \
  --project-id PROJECT_ID \
  --id ITEM_ID \
  --field-id FIELD_ID \
  --single-select-option-id DONE_OPTION_ID
```

#### 5e. Update Retrospective

Add learnings to RETROSPECTIVE.md following the established format. See the retrospective for examples.

```bash
# Edit RETROSPECTIVE.md to add entry
git add RETROSPECTIVE.md
git commit -m "docs: Add retrospective for PR #45"
```

#### 5f. Push Changes

```bash
git push
```

### Step 6: Verify Integration

After integration completes:

```bash
# Verify branch deleted
git branch -a | grep feat/45

# Verify spec integrated (if applicable)
ls docs/specs/

# Verify retrospective updated
tail -20 RETROSPECTIVE.md

# Verify project board updated
gh project item-list PROJECT_NUMBER --owner @me
```

## Automated Retrospective Summarization

To prevent `RETROSPECTIVE.md` from becoming unmanageably long, the `integrate-change.sh` script includes an automated summarization feature powered by the Gemini CLI.

**How it works:**
1.  **Threshold Check**: Before adding a new entry, the script checks the line count of `RETROSPECTIVE.md`.
2.  **Trigger**: If the line count exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 150 lines), the summarization process is triggered.
3.  **Preservation**: The script preserves the initial sections of the file, including the introduction and the "Historical Learnings" section.
4.  **Summarization**: It takes the older sprint entries, sends them to the `gemini` CLI, and requests a concise summary that preserves key learnings and markdown structure.
5.  **Reconstruction**: The script then overwrites `RETROSPECTIVE.md` with the preserved header, a new "Summarized Sprints (via Gemini)" section, and the newly generated summary.
6.  **New Entry**: Finally, it appends the new retrospective entry to the freshly summarized file.

This ensures that the file remains a valuable and readable source of information without requiring manual pruning.

## Error Handling

### PR Not Merged

**Symptom**: Script reports PR is not in MERGED state

**Solution**:
- Verify PR number is correct
- Wait for PR to be merged
- Check auto-merge status if enabled
- Manually merge PR if needed

### Branch Already Deleted

**Symptom**: Git reports branch doesn't exist

**Solution**:
- This is normal if auto-merge deleted the branch
- Continue with remaining integration steps
- Script handles this gracefully with `|| echo "..."`

### Spec Directory Not Found

**Symptom**: Script cannot find change directory

**Solution**:
- Verify the change directory path is correct
- Check if this feature even had a spec proposal
- Skip spec integration step if not applicable
- Use `-c` flag only when spec exists

### Permission Denied on Project Board

**Symptom**: GitHub API returns 403 error

**Solution**:
- Verify project board IDs are correct
- Ensure you have write access to the project
- Check `gh` authentication: `gh auth status`
- Update script configuration variables if needed

### Gemini CLI Issues

**Symptom**: The script fails during the "Updating retrospective..." step with an error related to the `gemini` command.

**Solution**:
- Ensure the `gemini` CLI is installed and in your system's PATH.
- Verify you are authenticated. Run `gemini auth` if needed.
- Check for any Gemini API-related issues or outages.
- If the issue persists, you can temporarily increase the `RETROSPECTIVE_MAX_LINES` variable in the script to bypass the summarization and add your entry.

### Retrospective Format Issues

**Symptom**: The automated summary has formatting problems or seems to have lost critical information.

**Solution**:
- The summarization is automated and may not be perfect. The original, unsummarized content is not retained by the script.
- You can review the commit history for `RETROSPECTIVE.md` in git to find the previous version if you need to recover information.
- Manually edit the summarized content to fix any formatting issues.
- Consider adjusting the prompt sent to the Gemini CLI within the `summarize_retrospective` function in the script for better results in the future.

## Configuration Notes

The script uses these hardcoded configuration variables (lines 31-33):

```bash
PROJECT_ID="PVT_kwHOARC_Ns4BG9YU"
FIELD_ID="PVTSSF_lAHOARC_Ns4BG9YUzg32qas"  # Workflow Stage
DONE_OPTION_ID="6bc77efe"
```

**To adapt for your project:**
1. Find your project ID: `gh project list --owner @me`
2. Find field ID: `gh api graphql -f query='...'` (see GitHub docs)
3. Find done option ID: Query project field values
4. Update these variables in the script

**Note**: A future version should detect these dynamically.

## Notes

- **Run after PR is merged**: This is post-merge cleanup, not pre-merge preparation
- **Spec integration is optional**: Only for features that started with spec proposals
- **Retrospective is required**: Always update with learnings from completed work
- **Branch cleanup prevents clutter**: Keeps repository clean and organized
- **Project board sync**: Ensures status accurately reflects completed work
- **Manual steps work too**: Script is a convenience, not required
- **Integration commits go to main**: These are documentation updates, not code changes
- **Keep retrospective focused**: Capture what worked, what didn't, and key lessons
- **One PR per integration**: Run the workflow once per merged PR
- **Script is not fully automated**: Still requires parameters and decision-making
