# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working in `memgraph/ai-toolkit`. Keep it in sync
with the codebase — update it in the same PR as the change that makes part
of it stale.

## What this repo is

Memgraph AI Toolkit — a `uv` workspace of independently-versioned Python
packages for building AI/agent applications on Memgraph: core DB utilities,
framework integrations (LangChain, MCP, LightRAG), a document-to-graph
pipeline, a SQL-to-graph migration agent, and **Context Graph**, a family of
components that turn Claude Code / Codex agent sessions into a queryable
Memgraph graph.

## Repository layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `memgraph-toolbox/` | Core Memgraph client/tooling. Dependency of nearly everything else here. |
| `integrations/langchain-memgraph/` | LangChain graph store, QA chain, toolkit. |
| `integrations/mcp-memgraph/` | MCP server exposing Memgraph to LLMs. |
| `integrations/lightrag-memgraph/` | LightRAG storage backends (KV/vector/doc-status/graph) on Memgraph. |
| `unstructured2graph/` | Chunks unstructured input (files/URLs/text) and hands chunks to LightRAG for entity extraction. Outside the Context Graph family but shares its testing conventions. |
| `agents/sql2graph/` | MySQL/Postgres → Memgraph migration agent. Has its own `uv.lock`/`.python-version`; run it with `cd agents/sql2graph && uv run main.py`. |
| `context-graph/` | The Context Graph family — see below. |
| `scripts/dev-memgraph.sh` | Local dev lifecycle: exploration Memgraph + isolated test Memgraph for the context-graph family and unstructured2graph. |
| `skills/release/SKILL.md` | Release process for every PyPI/Docker-published package. |

### The Context Graph family (`context-graph/`)

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `agent-context-graph` | Event hub. Normalizes runtime hooks / SDK activity into a shared Event Protocol and routes it to graph connectors. |
| `actions-graph` | Records tool calls/results/messages/subagent activity as `(:Action)`/`(:Agent)` nodes — observability, not memory. |
| `skills-graph` | Tracks Agent-Skills-spec `(:Skill)` usage per session. |
| `sessions-graph` | Owns `(:User)`/`(:Session)`, durable `(:Memory)` writes/recall, and session reconciliation into `(:Episode)` + extracted entities. |

Everything joins on a shared, idempotently-`MERGE`d `(:Session {session_id})`
node; only `sessions-graph` owns `(:User)` and `HAD_SESSION`.

Substantial design work in this family is tracked as GitHub issues labeled
`wayfinder:map` (title `Map: ...`), broken into `wayfinder:grilling` /
`wayfinder:research` / `wayfinder:prototype` / `wayfinder:task` child issues,
using this repo's `/grilling`, `/domain-modeling`, and `/research` skills.

## Environment & setup

- Python `>=3.10`, dependency/workspace manager is `uv`. Workspace members are
  listed in the root `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.uv.workspace]`.
- Install a package editable with its test extras, e.g.:
  ```bash
  uv pip install -e memgraph-toolbox"[test]"   # quote extras on zsh/macOS
  ```
- Working from a nested worktree under this checkout (e.g.
  `.claude/worktrees/<name>/`)? Run `uv venv` there first. With no local
  `.venv`, `uv pip install -e ...`/`uv run --package ...` walk up and
  silently reuse — and mutate — the outer checkout's shared `.venv`,
  repointing its editable installs at whichever worktree you happen to run
  from. That's a real collision if another worktree or session relies on
  that same shared environment.
- Run a workspace package's own suite via `uv run --package <name> --extra test pytest ...`
  (see `.github/workflows/tests.yaml` for the exact invocation per package,
  including which extras each one needs — e.g. `skills-graph`, `actions-graph`,
  and `sessions-graph` all also need `--extra agent-context-graph`, and
  `sessions-graph` additionally needs `--extra reconciliation`).

## Common commands

**Lint / format** (matches `.github/workflows/lint.yaml`):
```bash
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
# to fix locally:
ruff check --fix . && ruff format .
```
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` runs the same ruff hooks plus
trailing-whitespace/end-of-file-fixer/check-yaml/check-toml/large-file/merge-conflict checks.

**Tests, non-context-graph packages** — start a plain Memgraph container and
run pytest in the package directory (see root `README.md` "Developing
Locally" and `tests.yaml` for per-package extras/env vars, e.g.
`langchain-memgraph` and `memgraph-toolbox`'s evaluation extras need
`OPENAI_API_KEY`).

**Tests, Context Graph family + unstructured2graph** — these test against a
*real* Memgraph, not mocks (see Testing policy below). Don't hand-start a
stray container for these; `scripts/dev-memgraph.sh` owns the disposable test
instance so the automated suite can never collide with or wipe your
exploration data:
```bash
./scripts/dev-memgraph.sh test                  # all packages
./scripts/dev-memgraph.sh test sessions-graph    # one package
./scripts/dev-memgraph.sh test-down              # reclaim the test container when done
```
The same script also drives a disposable *exploration* Memgraph
(`up`/`hooks-local`/`inspect`/`reconcile`/`down`) for dogfooding against your
own real Claude Code session — see `./scripts/dev-memgraph.sh --help`.

## Code style

- `ruff`, line length 120, target `py310`. Several naming-convention rules
  (`N803`/`N806`/`N812`/`N815`) are deliberately ignored repo-wide because
  graph/DB code follows external casing conventions (e.g. `G` for a graph
  variable, Cypher/SQL identifier casing) — don't add per-line `noqa` for
  those, the ignore is already global in root `pyproject.toml`.
- `isort`'s `known-first-party` list is maintained by hand in
  `pyproject.toml` — add your package's import name there if you add a new
  workspace member.
- Prefer expressive names, small functions, and clear control flow over
  explanatory comments.
- Comments should explain intent, invariants, external constraints, or
  non-obvious tradeoffs. Do not use comments to narrate obvious operations or
  restate the code.
- Public modules, classes, functions, and methods need docstrings describing
  behavior, parameters, return values, and raised exceptions where relevant.
  Use the existing concise style unless a package establishes a more detailed
  convention; do not copy documentation templates containing placeholder text.
- Keep comments and docstrings synchronized with the implementation. Remove
  commented-out code and stale notes when the related code changes.
- TODOs must describe the missing behavior and include an issue reference:
  `TODO(#123): ...`. Use a normal code comment for a temporary local note,
  not an owner-only TODO.
- Every `noqa`, `type: ignore`, and `pragma: no cover` suppression must be
  narrow and include a specific reason. Prefer fixing the underlying issue or
  narrowing the suppression over adding a broad file-level exemption. The
  standalone `agents/sql2graph` entry points are a documented legacy exception
  while that package's import layout is migrated.
- Comments around Cypher/SQL must document security boundaries, parameterization
  decisions, transaction semantics, or graph-model invariants when those facts
  are not clear from the code. Never interpolate untrusted values into queries.

## Type checking

This repo standardizes on [`ty`](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/) (Astral's type
checker — same vendor as `uv`/`ruff`), not `mypy` or `pyright`. **Enforced in
CI**, blocking: `.github/workflows/lint.yaml`'s `typecheck` job. `ty` resolves
imports through installed packages (unlike `ruff`, which is purely
syntactic), and cross-package imports span the whole workspace (e.g.
`agent-context-graph` optionally imports `skills-graph`/`actions-graph`/
`sessions-graph`), so CI syncs the full workspace before checking:
```bash
uv sync --all-packages --all-extras
ty check .
```
For a quick local check of just what you touched, without a full sync, you
can still point `ty` at one package's own venv — but expect spurious
unresolved-import diagnostics for anything that imports across packages:
```bash
uvx ty check <package>/src --python .venv
```

## Testing policy: prefer real Memgraph over mocks

A cross-cutting rule for the Context Graph family and unstructured2graph,
established after two real bugs (a missing `--connector` flag requirement,
and `actions-graph` defaulting to the wrong agent-spawning tool name) shipped
past a fully-green, fully-mocked test suite and were only caught by
`scripts/dev-memgraph.sh test-graph-model` against a real Claude Code
session.

**Keep mocked**: hook/adapter → Event Protocol translation and Event
Protocol → persistence-call translation (pure mapping, proven for real one
layer down); pure model/dataclass validation with no I/O; exception branches
a real Memgraph genuinely can't trigger; the LLM boundary in tests that
aren't specifically about LLM behavior (real-LLM tests exist too, gated
behind `requires_openai_key`-style skip markers — not deleted).

**Convert to real e2e, or delete outright**: any test that asserts on the
literal Cypher query string sent to a mocked client rather than executing
it — a plausible-looking string can still be rejected by real Memgraph.
Delete it if a real `test_e2e.py` already proves the same behavior; convert
it (same scenario, executed against a real Memgraph, asserted on the
resulting graph shape) if nothing else covers it. Prefer a real instance of
another package's class over a hand-rolled fake standing in for it (e.g.
don't fake `ActionsGraph` inside `sessions-graph`'s tests) — a fake can
silently drift from the real shape as that package evolves.

## Commit conventions

Subject line is `<package>: <imperative, lowercase summary> (#PR)`, e.g.
`sessions-graph: reconcile_session() now writes episodic Session.summary`.
Cross-cutting family changes use `context-graph: ...`. Issue/ticket numbers
belong in commit bodies or PR descriptions, not inline in *code comments* —
that was tried and explicitly reverted.

Credentials note: hook subprocesses (Claude Code/Codex) resolve Memgraph and
LLM config **only** from `~/.config/context-graph/config.toml`, never from
environment variables at runtime — non-interactive hook subprocesses don't
source shell profiles, so an env-var-only path would silently work in your
interactive shell and silently fail in the hook. Keep that boundary when
touching `agent-context-graph`'s hook/config code.

## Releases

All release workflows are manual (`workflow_dispatch` from the Actions tab);
bump the subproject's `pyproject.toml` version before dispatching. Full
package-to-workflow mapping and required secrets: `skills/release/SKILL.md`.
