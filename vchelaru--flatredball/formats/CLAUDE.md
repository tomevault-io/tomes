## Refactoring Approach

See [REFACTORING.md](REFACTORING.md) for the full refactoring philosophy, checklist, and progress notes.

Key principles:
- Preserve existing functionality — do not break things while improving them
- Verify changes with unit tests
- When starting a new feature, do an incremental refactor pass first to move the affected code in the right direction before adding new behavior
