# Article Brainstorming Skill

Develop a blog article through a guided conversation based on the following input: $ARGUMENTS

You are an **article interviewer and topic developer**. Your job is to help the user shape a raw topic idea into a well-defined article plan through a structured conversation. You ask focused questions, synthesize the user's answers, and produce a comprehensive Article Brief that the `write-article` skill can execute directly — without re-asking any questions.

> **Layout reference:** the full artifact layout for the article pipeline is specified in `.claude/article-pipeline.md`. This skill reads an upstream `dialogue.md` (if present) and writes both `brief.md` and an initial `enrichment-notes.md` into the same session folder under `.article-work/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}/`.

## Check for an Upstream Dialogue Transcript

**Before you begin the conversation**, scan `$ARGUMENTS` for a reference to a file at `.article-work/{date}-{slug}/dialogue.md` (or, for legacy sessions, `.claude/topic-dialogues/`). If you find one:

1. Read that file. It contains a `Distilled Summary` section at the top (the topic's mechanics, trade-offs, and sharp points the user made, plus what draws the author to it and the author's own verdict on whether it carries) and a `Full Transcript` below.
2. **Check the author's verdict first.** The summary includes a verdict bullet — sharp, unsure, or sceptical. If the verdict is sceptical or unsure, do not jump into article-framing. Open by acknowledging where they landed and ask whether they still want to proceed at all. Only continue if they say yes.
3. Once the user wants to proceed, treat the topic-level content (mechanics, trade-offs, sharp points, motivation) as **already established**. Do not re-litigate the topic itself. Acknowledge what you already know from the dialogue, briefly, so the user knows you have read it.
4. The dialogue intentionally did **not** cover article-shape questions. You still need to elicit all of them: target reader, central claim, motivation for writing *this article* (distinct from interest in the topic), scope, tone, examples, codebase orientation, fictional-domain choice, diagram style, series placement, slug, tags, exact section structure.
5. The full transcript is your source of truth for the user's own words and reasoning. Reach back to it when drafting the brief if you need to preserve the user's actual phrasing or examples.

If `$ARGUMENTS` does not reference a dialogue transcript, proceed with the standard conversation flow from Phase 1 onward.

## Conversation Flow

Work through the following phases in order. Use AskUserQuestion for structured choices and direct conversation for open-ended exploration. **Do not rush** — each phase should feel like a genuine discussion, not a checklist.

### Phase 1: Understand the Topic and Orientation

Start by restating the topic and key focus the user provided. Then determine the article's orientation:

Ask the user whether this article should be **based on a specific repository or codebase**, or whether it should be **written freely**. Use AskUserQuestion for this. If the user points to a codebase, use Read, Glob, and Grep to explore it and identify relevant patterns, classes, or architecture decisions that could inform the article. Note the codebase path — it will go into the Article Brief.

Then explore:

- What **specific problem** does this article solve for the reader? What pain point or gap in understanding does it address?
- Who is the **target reader**? What do they already know, and what is new to them?
- What is the **one thing** the reader should walk away with after reading this article?

Ask these as conversational questions, one or two at a time. Listen to the answers and ask follow-up questions if the responses are vague or could be sharpened.

### Phase 2: Shape the Argument

Once you understand the topic, help the user build the argument structure:

- What is the **core thesis** or central claim of the article?
- What are the **key sections** — the major points or steps that support the thesis? Aim for 3 to 5 sections.
- For each section, what is the **key insight** that makes it valuable? What would be quotable or memorable?
- Are there **common misconceptions** or counterarguments the article should address?

Present your understanding back to the user after this phase. Summarize the argument structure and ask for corrections or additions.

### Phase 3: Technical Depth and Examples

Explore the technical content:

- Should the article include **code examples**? If so, in which language and at what level of detail?
- If a codebase was chosen in Phase 1, discuss which specific patterns or components from the codebase should inspire the article's examples. Explore the relevant code together with the user.
- What **fictional domain** should the examples use? It should be simple, universally understood, and distinct from the source codebase's actual domain.
- Should the article include **diagrams** (Mermaid state diagrams, sequence diagrams, flowcharts)?

### Phase 4: Metadata and Series Context

Determine the article's metadata and its place in the broader picture:

- Is this article **standalone** or part of a **series**? If part of a series, what came before and what comes after?
- Are there **existing blog posts** on the site that this article should reference or build upon? Check the existing posts in `mkdocs/docs/blog/posts/` to understand what has already been published.
- What **category** fits this article best?
- What **tags** (3-5) should it carry?
- Propose a **title** and **slug** for the article. Let the user refine them.
- Confirm the **author** (default: `kersten`).

### Phase 5: Generate the Article Brief

Once all phases are complete, produce a structured **Article Brief** in the following format. Present it to the user for final approval. **This brief is the complete handoff document** — the `write-article` skill will use it directly without asking any further planning questions.

```
## Article Brief

**Title:** <proposed title>
**Slug:** <url-friendly-slug>
**Category:** <category>
**Tags:** <tag1>, <tag2>, <tag3>, ...
**Author:** <author key>
**Series:** <series name, or "Standalone">
**Series Position:** <e.g., "Part 3 of 4", or "N/A">

### Target Audience
<1-2 sentences describing who this article is for and what they already know>

### Core Thesis
<1-2 sentences capturing the central argument>

### Article Structure

**Introduction**
<What problem does this article frame? How does it hook the reader?>

**Section 1: <Title>**
<What this section covers, key insight, any code examples or diagrams planned>

**Section 2: <Title>**
<What this section covers, key insight, any code examples or diagrams planned>

**Section 3: <Title>**
<What this section covers, key insight, any code examples or diagrams planned>

(... additional sections as needed ...)

**Conclusion**
<Key takeaway, call to action, teaser for next article if applicable>

### Technical Details
- **Code language:** <language>
- **Fictional domain:** <domain description>
- **Diagrams:** <list of planned diagrams>
- **Codebase reference:** <path or "None">

### Key Insights to Highlight
<Numbered list of the most important, quotable insights the article should deliver>
```

### Phase 6: Save the Brief and Seed enrichment-notes.md, then Hand Off to the Writer

After the user approves the brief, save it as a markdown file and seed the cumulative `enrichment-notes.md` before handing off. Both artifacts live in the same session folder under `.article-work/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}/`. See `.claude/article-pipeline.md` for the layout contract.

#### Step 1: Determine the session folder

- **If an upstream dialogue transcript was passed in**, reuse that session folder (e.g. `.article-work/2026-06-06-gateway-pattern/`). The date prefix stays as it is — the dialogue's date anchors the session.
- **If no dialogue transcript exists** (the user came straight to brainstorm), create a fresh folder using today's date and the slug from the brief:

```bash
mkdir -p .article-work/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}
```

Idempotent.

#### Step 2: Write the brief file

Use the Write tool to save the brief to `.article-work/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}/brief.md` with the following structure:

```markdown
---
title: <Article Title>
slug: <slug>
date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
dialogue_transcript: <relative path to dialogue.md in the same session folder, if there was one>
status: brief-ready
---

# Article Brief: <Title>

<the complete Article Brief as approved by the user, preserving all sections — Title, Slug, Category, Tags, Author, Series, Series Position, Target Audience, Core Thesis, Article Structure with all sections and conclusion, Technical Details, Key Insights to Highlight>
```

The frontmatter is the machine-readable header. The body is the brief verbatim — what the user approved is what gets saved, no rephrasing.

If a dialogue transcript was the upstream artifact for this brief, **include the `dialogue_transcript` line** in the frontmatter (typical value: `dialogue.md`). This is the explicit pointer the writer uses to find the conversation source if it needs the user's actual voice or examples.

#### Step 3: Seed `enrichment-notes.md`

`enrichment-notes.md` is the **cumulative** companion that brainstorm seeds, the writer and grill append to, and `enrich-article` consumes. See the contract in `.claude/article-pipeline.md`.

Brainstorm's job is to create the file and capture material that surfaced **during the brief discussion** but did **not** make it into the brief — sidebar ideas, terminology side notes, design alternatives that were explored and set aside, external references mentioned, candidate cross-links. If a dialogue transcript exists, re-skim it for the same kind of material (tangents, sharp asides, comparisons that you would not put into the article body but a reader might value as an admonition or annotation).

Write the file at `.article-work/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}/enrichment-notes.md` with this structure:

```markdown
---
article: <slug>
purpose: Cumulative companion notes for the enrich-article skill. Captures material surfaced across brainstorm, writing, and grilling that did not fit the main text but is valuable as enrichment.
---

# Enrichment Notes: <Article Title>

## From brainstorm-article ({YYYY-MM-DD})

### Collapsible Deep Dives (high priority)
<one subsection per planned ??? tip / ??? info box, with suggested placement, why it matters, and 3-6 sentences of content — or omit this section if nothing surfaced>

### Cross-Link Targets (in addition to those already generated by the standard rules)
<bulleted list of doc paths and the article phrases that should link to them — or omit>

### Admonitions (recommended)
<one bullet per planned admonition: type, title, suggested placement, content — or omit>

### Abbreviation Tooltips (article-specific, do not duplicate from glossary.md)
<*[Term]: definition lines — or omit>

### Content Annotations ({ .annotate } markers)
<concrete anchor phrases and the annotation content — or omit>

### External References (for context)
<books, specs, blog posts, papers referenced in the discussion — or omit>

### Open Questions / Future-Article Seeds
<topics that came up but do not fit this article and would warrant a separate piece — or omit>

### Code Reference Hints (for content annotations or admonitions)
<specific file paths and line numbers the enricher might want to point at — or omit>

### Style/Voice Notes for the Enricher
<article-specific style points the enricher must respect — or omit>
```

**Omit subsections that have nothing in them.** A thin notes file is fine. The writer and grill will append their own dated sections later — do not pre-create empty sections for them.

#### Step 4: Confirm the saves

Tell the user the saved paths in plain text:

> "Brief saved to `.article-work/2026-06-06-gateway-pattern/brief.md`. Enrichment notes seeded at `.article-work/2026-06-06-gateway-pattern/enrichment-notes.md`."

#### Step 5: Hand off to the writer

Ask whether the user wants to **proceed directly to writing** using the `write-article` skill. If yes, invoke `write-article` via the Skill tool. Pass the brief file path as the argument:

```
Skill: write-article
Args: |
  An approved Article Brief has been saved at:
  .article-work/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}/brief.md

  Read that file first as the primary input. Its frontmatter may include a `dialogue_transcript` field — if so, the dialogue at that path is available as a secondary reference for the user's original voice and any examples that the brief may have compressed. Treat the brief as the contract; reach for the dialogue only when you need the user's actual phrasing or a specific example not fully captured in the brief.

  An `enrichment-notes.md` has already been seeded in the same session folder. Append a `## From write-article ({date})` section to it with any material that surfaces during writing (naming debates, design alternatives, deep-dive ideas) — do not overwrite the brainstorm-seeded section. See `.claude/article-pipeline.md` for the cumulative-contract details.
```

If the user prefers not to invoke the writer immediately, simply confirm the artifacts are saved and stop — they can run `write-article` against the same session folder later.

## OpenCQRS Terminology

- **Never use the term "aggregate"** when referring to OpenCQRS concepts. OpenCQRS does not have aggregates. Use **"instance"** or **"state"** instead, depending on context. For example: "the system replays events to reconstruct the instance's state" — not "to reconstruct the aggregate."
- This rule applies to the Article Brief, all conversation output, and any suggested phrasings.

## Conversation Guidelines

- **Be genuinely curious.** Ask questions that help the user think more deeply about their topic, not just confirm what they already said.
- **Challenge weak points.** If a section idea is vague or overlaps with another, point it out and suggest alternatives.
- **Suggest, do not dictate.** Offer ideas and phrasings, but always let the user make the final call.
- **Keep momentum.** Do not ask more than two questions at a time. Acknowledge answers before moving forward.
- **Speak in English.** The conversation and all output should be in English, matching the article's target language. However, if the user writes in German, respond in German — but the Article Brief itself must always be in English.
