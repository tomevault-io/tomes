## Creating a New Skill

### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Define Purpose**

```
User: "Create a skill for our deployment workflow"

Claude: [ccpm-skill-creator activates]

Let's create a custom CCPM skill for your deployment workflow.

First, let me understand the purpose:

Questions:
1. What does this skill do?
   → "Automates deployment checklist and notifications"

2. When should it activate?
   → "When deploying to staging or production"

3. Which CCPM commands does it work with?
   → "/ccpm:done for production deploys"

4. Does it write to external systems?
   → "Yes - posts to Slack, updates Jira"

5. Is it team-specific or project-specific?
   → "Team-specific - all projects use same deployment process"

Got it! Creating deployment workflow skill...
```

**Step 2: Generate Skill Structure**

```
Creating skill: acme-deployment

Directory structure:
skills/acme-deployment/
├── SKILL.md (main skill definition)
├── deployment-checklist.md (reference doc)
└── environments.md (staging vs production)

Generating SKILL.md with CCPM integration...
```

**Step 3: Add CCPM Integration**

```yaml
---
name: acme-deployment
description: Automates Acme Corp deployment workflow with environment-specific checklists, Slack notifications, and Jira updates. Auto-activates when deploying to staging/production or running /ccpm:done. Enforces deployment checklist completion before external notifications.
---

# Acme Deployment Workflow

Custom deployment workflow for Acme Corp projects.

## When to Use

Auto-activates when:
- User mentions: "deploy to staging", "deploy to production", "ship it"
- Running `/ccpm:done` command
- Creating release PR

## Integration with CCPM

### Commands
- `/ccpm:done` - Triggers deployment checklist
- `/ccpm:verify` - Pre-deployment verification

### Skills
- `external-system-safety` - Confirms Slack/Jira writes
- `ccpm-code-review` - Ensures verification before deploy

## Instructions

### Deployment Checklist

Before any deployment:

## Best Practices for Skill Creation

### Do's

- ✅ Use clear, descriptive skill names
- ✅ Include comprehensive trigger phrases
- ✅ Reference CCPM commands explicitly
- ✅ Follow CCPM safety rules
- ✅ Add concrete examples
- ✅ Document external system writes
- ✅ Test skill activation

### Don'ts

- ❌ Create overly broad skills
- ❌ Duplicate existing CCPM functionality
- ❌ Skip safety considerations
- ❌ Forget to document CCPM integration
- ❌ Use vague descriptions
- ❌ Hardcode company-specific values
- ❌ Ignore allowed-tools restrictions

## Skill Naming Conventions

### CCPM-Specific Skills

Prefix with `ccpm-`:
- `ccpm-code-review`
- `ccpm-debugging`
- `ccpm-mcp-management`

### Team-Specific Skills

Prefix with team/company name:
- `acme-deployment`
- `engineering-oncall`
- `mobile-release`

### Project-Specific Skills

Store in `.claude/skills/` (not plugin):
- `ecommerce-checkout`
- `auth-migration`
- `analytics-pipeline`

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Command Integration

**Skill activates alongside CCPM command**:

```yaml
---
name: team-pr-template
description: Adds team-specific PR template when running /ccpm:done
---

# Team PR Template

## Integration with CCPM

Works with `/ccpm:done`:
1. CCPM creates base PR
2. This skill adds team-specific template
3. Template includes:
   - Testing checklist
   - Security review
   - Performance impact
   - Documentation updates
```

### Pattern 2: Hook Complement

**Skill provides context for hook**:

```yaml
---
name: team-tdd-guide
description: Provides team-specific TDD guidance when tdd-enforcer hook blocks writes
---

# Team TDD Guide

## Integration with CCPM

Complements `tdd-enforcer` hook:
- Hook: Blocks write without tests
- This skill: Explains team's TDD patterns
- Together: Enforcement + education
```

### Pattern 3: Safety Layer

**Skill adds extra safety checks**:

```yaml
---
name: fintech-compliance
description: Enforces financial compliance rules on top of CCPM safety rules
---

# FinTech Compliance

## Integration with CCPM

Works with `external-system-safety`:
- external-system-safety: Confirms all external writes
- This skill: Adds finance-specific checks
  - Audit logging required
  - Dual approval for prod changes
  - Compliance documentation
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Creating Deployment Skill

```
User: "Create a skill for our deployment workflow"

Claude: [ccpm-skill-creator activates]

I'll help you create a custom deployment skill.

Questions:
1. What deployment environments do you have?
2. What checks are required before deployment?
3. Who should be notified on deployment?
4. Any external systems to update?

[After gathering requirements]

Creating skill: acme-deployment

Files created:
✅ skills/acme-deployment/SKILL.md
✅ skills/acme-deployment/checklist.md
✅ skills/acme-deployment/environments.md

Skill includes:
- Environment-specific workflows (staging vs prod)
- Pre-deployment checklist
- Slack notification integration
- Jira status updates
- Safety confirmations for production

Test the skill by saying: "Deploy to staging"

Would you like to review the skill before using it?
```

### Example 2: Creating Team Workflow

```
User: "Create a skill for our code review process"

Claude: [ccpm-skill-creator activates]

Creating team code review skill...

I see CCPM already has `ccpm-code-review` for verification.
Your custom skill can add team-specific practices on top.

Template created:
```yaml
---
name: acme-code-review
description: Acme Corp code review standards. Adds team-specific checks to ccpm-code-review. Requires architecture review for database changes, security review for auth code, and performance review for critical paths.
---

# Acme Code Review Standards

## Integration with CCPM

Extends `ccpm-code-review` with team rules:
- Database changes → Architecture review required
- Auth code → Security review required
- Critical path → Performance review required

## Instructions

[Team-specific review criteria]
```

Would you like to add more team-specific rules?
```

## Skill Distribution

### Team Skills (Version Control)

```bash
# Store in project repository
git add .claude/skills/team-deployment/
git commit -m "Add team deployment skill"
git push

# Team members get skill automatically
git pull  # Skill now available
```

### Company Skills (Shared Repository)

```bash
# Create shared skills repository
# company-claude-skills/
