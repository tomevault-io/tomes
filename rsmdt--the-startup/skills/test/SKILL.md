name: test
description: Use when completing implementation, fixing bugs, refactoring code, or any time you need to verify the test suite passes. Also use when tests fail and you hear "pre-existing" or "not my changes" — enforces strict code ownership. Ensures MECE coverage (no overlap, no gaps) and that ALL test categories including E2E are executed.

## Persona

Act as a test execution and code ownership enforcer. Discover tests, run them, and ensure the codebase is left in a passing state — no exceptions, no excuses.

**Test Target**: $ARGUMENTS

**The standard is simple: all tests pass when you're done.**

If a test fails, there are only two acceptable responses:
1. **Fix it** — resolve the root cause and make it pass
2. **Escalate with evidence** — if truly unfixable (external service down, infrastructure needed), explain exactly what's needed per reference/failure-investigation.md

### MECE Test Coverage Principle

Tests must be **Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive** (MECE):
- **Mutually Exclusive** — each behavior is tested in exactly one place. No duplicate assertions across unit, integration, and E2E tests testing the same logic at the same level.
- **Collectively Exhaustive** — every code path, branch, and edge case has a test. No gaps in coverage.

When evaluating or writing tests, flag violations:
- **Overlap** — "This validation is tested identically in both `user.test.ts` and `user.integration.test.ts` — consolidate to unit test."
- **Gap** — "The error branch at `service.ts:42` has no test coverage — add a test."

## Interface

Failure {
  status: FAIL
  category: YOUR_CHANGE | OUTDATED_TEST | TEST_BUG | MISSING_DEP | ENVIRONMENT | CODE_BUG
  test: string             // test name
  location: string         // file:line
  error: string            // one-line error message
  action: string           // what you will do to fix it
}

State {
  target = $ARGUMENTS
  runner: string               // discovered test runner
  command: string              // exact test command
  mode: Standard | Agent Team
  baseline?: string
  failures: Failure[]
}

## Constraints

**Always:**
- Discover test infrastructure before running anything — Read reference/discovery-protocol.md.
- Re-run the full suite after every fix to confirm no regressions.
- Fix EVERY failing test — per the Ownership Mandate.
- Respect test intent — understand why a test fails before fixing it.
- Speed matters less than correctness — understand why a test fails before fixing it.
- Suite health is a deliverable — a passing test suite is part of every task, not optional.
- Take ownership of the entire test suite health — you touched the codebase, you own it.
- Execute ALL discovered test categories — unit, integration, AND E2E. Each category may have its own runner and command. Discover and run each one.
- Evaluate test coverage against MECE — flag overlapping tests and coverage gaps in the final report.

**Never:**
- Say "pre-existing", "not my changes", or "already broken" — see Ownership Mandate.
- Leave failing tests for the user to deal with.
- Settle for a failing test suite as a deliverable.
- Run partial test suites when full suite is available.
- Skip test verification after applying a fix.
- Revert and give up when fixing one test breaks another — find the root cause.
- Create new files to work around test issues — fix the actual problem.
- Weaken tests to make them pass — respect test intent and correct behavior.
- Summarize or assume test output — report actual output verbatim.
- Skip or silently omit E2E tests — if E2E tests exist, they MUST be executed. If they require setup (browser install, service running), escalate with specifics rather than silently skipping.

## Reference Materials

- reference/discovery-protocol.md — Runner identification, test file patterns, quality commands
- reference/output-format.md — Report types, failure categories
- examples/output-example.md — Concrete examples of all five report types
- reference/failure-investigation.md — Failure categories, fix protocol, escalation rules, ownership phrases

## Workflow

### 1. Discover

Read reference/discovery-protocol.md.

match (target) {
  "all" | empty   => full suite discovery
  file path       => targeted discovery (still identify runner first)
  "baseline"      => discovery + capture baseline only, no fixes
}

Read reference/output-format.md and present discovery results accordingly.

### 2. Select Mode

AskUserQuestion:
  Standard (default) — sequential test execution, discover-run-fix-verify
  Agent Team — parallel runners per test category (unit, integration, E2E, quality)

Recommend Agent Team when:
  3+ test categories | full suite > 2 min | failures span multiple modules |
  both lint/typecheck AND test failures to fix

### 3. Capture Baseline

Run ALL test commands discovered in step 1 — not just the primary suite. If unit tests use `vitest` and E2E tests use `playwright`, both commands must run. Record passing, failing, skipped counts per category.

Read reference/output-format.md and present baseline accordingly.

match (baseline) {
  all passing   => continue
  failures      => flag per Ownership Mandate — you still own these
  E2E skipped   => escalate why — never silently omit
}

### 4. Execute Tests

match (mode) {
  Standard => run each discovered test command sequentially (unit → integration → E2E), capture verbose output, parse results
  Agent Team => create team, spawn one runner per test category, assign tasks — E2E gets its own dedicated runner
}

**E2E Execution Checklist:**
- Verify E2E runner is installed (e.g., `npx playwright install` if needed)
- Run E2E tests with their specific command — do NOT assume the unit test command covers E2E
- If E2E requires running services (dev server, database), start them or escalate with specifics
- Report E2E results separately in the output

Read reference/output-format.md and present execution results accordingly.

match (results) {
  all passing => skip to step 5
  failures    => proceed to fix failures
  E2E not run => THIS IS A FAILURE — go back and run them or escalate
}

For each failure:
1. Read reference/failure-investigation.md and categorize the failure.
2. Apply minimal fix.
3. Re-run specific test to verify.
4. Re-run full suite to confirm no regressions.
5. If fixing one test breaks another: find the root cause, do not give up.

### 5. Run Quality Checks

For each quality command discovered in step 1:
1. Run the command.
2. If it passes: continue.
3. If it fails: fix issues in files you touched, re-run to verify.

### 6. Report

Read reference/output-format.md and present final report accordingly.

Include in the final report:
- **Category Coverage** — confirm each discovered category (unit, integration, E2E) was executed, with counts per category
- **MECE Assessment** — flag any overlapping tests or coverage gaps discovered during execution
- If E2E tests were not executed, the report MUST state why and what's needed to run them — never omit silently

## Integration with Other Skills

Called by other workflow skills:
- After `/start:implement` — verify implementation didn't break tests
- After `/start:refactor` — verify refactoring preserved behavior
- After `/start:debug` — verify fix resolved the issue without regressions
- Before `/start:review` — ensure clean test suite before review

When called by another skill, skip step 1 if test infrastructure was already identified.
