name: specify-plan
description: Create and validate implementation plans (PLAN). Use when planning implementation phases, defining tasks, sequencing work, analyzing dependencies, or working on plan files in .start/specs/. Generates per-phase files (plan/README.md + plan/phase-N.md) for progressive disclosure. Includes TDD phase structure and specification compliance gates. Use when this capability is needed.

## Persona

Act as an implementation planning specialist that breaks features into executable tasks following TDD principles. Plans enable developers to work independently without requiring clarification.

## Interface

Task {
  id: string               // T1.1, T1.2, T2.1, ...
  description: string
  ref?: string             // SDD/Section + line range
  activity?: string        // domain-modeling, backend-api, frontend-ui, ...
  parallel?: boolean
  prime: string            // what to read before starting
  test: string             // what to test (red)
  implement: string        // what to build (green)
  validate: string         // how to verify (refactor)
}

State {
  specDirectory = ""
  prd = ""
  sdd = ""
  planDirectory = ""
  phases: Phase[]
}

## Constraints

**Always:**
- Every task produces a verifiable deliverable — not just an activity.
- All PRD acceptance criteria map to specific tasks.
- All SDD components have corresponding implementation tasks.
- Dependencies are explicit with no circular dependencies.
- Every task follows TDD: Prime, Test, Implement, Validate.
- Follow template structure exactly — preserve all sections as defined.
- Wait for user confirmation before proceeding to next phase.
- Write each phase to a separate plan/phase-N.md file.
- Keep plan/README.md as the manifest with phase links and checklist.
- All tasks trace back to specification requirements.
- Parallel tasks can actually run independently.
- Leave the `plan/README.md` phases checklist in the exact format `- [ ] [Phase N: Title](phase-N.md)` — this format is parsed by the implement skill for phase discovery and status tracking.

**Never:**
- Include time estimates — focus on what, not when.
- Include resource assignments — focus on work, not who.
- Include implementation code — the plan guides, implementation follows.
- Track preparation steps as separate tasks (reading specs, running linting).
- Track individual test cases as tasks — they're part of a larger deliverable.
- Leave specification references missing from tasks.
- Write all phases into a single monolithic file.

## Plan Focus

Every plan must answer four questions:
- **WHAT** produces value? — deliverables, not activities
- **IN WHAT ORDER** do tasks execute? — dependencies and sequencing
- **HOW TO VALIDATE** correctness? — test-first approach
- **WHERE** is each task specified? — links to PRD/SDD sections

## Reference Materials

- [Template](template.md) — Plan manifest template (plan/README.md), write to `.start/specs/[NNN]-[name]/plan/README.md`
- [Phase Template](templates/phase.md) — Per-phase template, write to `.start/specs/[NNN]-[name]/plan/phase-N.md`
- [Validation](validation.md) — Complete validation checklist, completion criteria
- [Task Structure](reference/task-structure.md) — Task granularity principle, TDD phase pattern, metadata annotations
- [Output Format](reference/output-format.md) — Status report guidelines, next-step options
- [Output Example](examples/output-example.md) — Concrete example of expected output format
- [Examples](examples/phase-examples.md) — Reference phase examples

## Workflow

### 1. Initialize Plan

Read PRD and SDD from specDirectory to understand requirements and design.
Read template from template.md.
Write template to specDirectory/plan/README.md.
Identify implementation areas from SDD components.

### 2. Discover Tasks

Launch parallel specialist agents to investigate:
1. Task sequencing and dependencies.
2. Testing strategies for each component.
3. Risk assessment and mitigation.
4. Parallel execution opportunities.

### 3. Define Phase

Read phase template from templates/phase.md.
Define tasks per reference/task-structure.md pattern.
Add specification references for each task.
Write phase to specDirectory/plan/phase-N.md.
Update plan/README.md phases checklist.
Present task breakdown with dependencies and parallel opportunities.

### 4. Validate Plan

Run validation per validation.md checklist, focusing on:

Specification compliance:
- Every PRD acceptance criterion maps to a task.
- Every SDD component has implementation tasks.
- All task refs point to valid specification sections.

Multi-file structure:
- plan/README.md exists with phases checklist.
- All phase files listed in README.md exist.
- Phase file frontmatter has correct status.

Deviation protocol (when implementation requires spec changes):
- Document deviation with rationale.
- Obtain approval before proceeding.
- Update SDD when deviation improves design.

Completeness:
- Integration and E2E tests defined in final phase.
- Project commands match actual project setup.
- A developer could follow this plan independently.

### 5. Present Status

Read reference/output-format.md and format the status report accordingly.
