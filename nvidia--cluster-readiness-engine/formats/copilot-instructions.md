# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents (Claude Code and others) when working with code in this repository. `AGENTS.md` is an exact copy of this file; `make check-agents-sync` keeps the two in sync.

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
make manifests generate   # MUST run after editing *_types.go or kubebuilder markers
make test                 # Unit tests + integration tests (requires envtest)
make test-integration     # Integration tests only (envtest + golden files)
make lint                 # golangci-lint
make lint-fix             # Auto-fix lint issues
make build                # Build binary to bin/manager
make docker-build         # Build Docker image
make helm-package         # Package the Helm chart
```

Run a single unit test:
```bash
go test ./pkg/workload/ -run TestAdapterForSpec -v
```

Run a single integration test case:
```bash
KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS="$(bin/setup-envtest use -p path)" \
  go test ./cmd/integration/ -v -timeout 300s -count=1 -run TestIntegration/reconcile/job-checkpoint-restart
```

Update golden files after intentional changes. Unit and integration golden files regenerate separately:
```bash
TESTUTIL_UPDATE_EXPECTED=true go test ./pkg/report/   # unit goldens, per package
TESTUTIL_UPDATE_EXPECTED=true make test-integration   # cmd/integration/testdata/ only
```

### UAT Tests (Kind + KWOK)

UAT tests validate rendered catalog output against golden files using a Kind cluster with KWOK-simulated GPU nodes. Requires: Docker, Kind, Tilt, Go 1.24+.

```bash
# Full lifecycle (CI):
make setup-test-uat     # Create Kind cluster
make tilt-uat-ci        # Deploy infra (Kubeflow Trainer, KWOK, controller) — headless
make test-uat-run       # Run UAT tests against deployed cluster
make cleanup-test-uat   # Delete Kind cluster

# One-shot (handles everything):
make test-uat
```

For development iteration (faster feedback loop):
```bash
make setup-test-uat              # Once
make tilt-uat                    # Interactive Tilt (keep in another terminal, hot-reloads)
make test-uat-run                # Run as needed
```

Run a single UAT test:
```bash
kind get kubeconfig --name nvcre-test-uat > /tmp/kind-uat.kubeconfig
KUBECONFIG=/tmp/kind-uat.kubeconfig NVCRECTL=bin/nvcrectl \
  go test -tags=uat ./test/uat/ -v -timeout 900s -count=1 -run TestAWSGB200NCCL
```

UAT golden files are in `test/uat/testdata/<csp>/<gpu>/nccl/expected_pods.yaml`. When catalog entries change, tests write `.actual` files on failure — review the diff, then copy `.actual` over the golden file if correct.

**Note**: If `tilt-uat-ci` fails with Kubeflow Trainer timeout, retry — it's a race condition on first deploy. The second run typically succeeds since Kubeflow is already running.

## Architecture

Kubebuilder-based Kubernetes controller for GPU cluster burn-in certification. Single binary, six reconcilers.

### CRD Hierarchy (Certification → Workflow → Job)

Follows the Deployment → ReplicaSet → Pod composition pattern:

- **Certification** creates one Workflow per category from the catalog. Records failed nodes per category with a reason. Workflow named `<certName>-<domain>-<variant>`.
- **Workflow** creates a single Job from `spec.jobTemplate`. Applies orchestration target, manages iterations, creates dependency resources. Job named `<workflowName>-job`.
- **Job** creates a workload (TrainJob) via the adapter pattern. Manages health monitoring, goodput measurement, checkpoint restart.
- **GoodputMeasurement** watches a Job, parses pod logs via LogProfile regex patterns, computes goodput ratio.
- **BandwidthMeasurement** watches a Job, parses NCCL log output, and computes per-bus bandwidth metrics.
- **LogProfile** (cluster-scoped) defines regex patterns with named capture groups for parsing training framework logs.

There is no Remediation controller. ADR-061 removed it. NVCRE does not taint, cordon, or patch nodes; it records failed nodes with a reason (`HardwareFailureDetected`, `ThresholdViolation`, or `WorkloadFailed`) in the Certification status.

### Key Packages

- `pkg/workload/` — Adapter interface normalizing five training frameworks to `WorkloadPhase` (Running/Succeeded/Failed). `ForSpec()` factory selects adapter based on which `WorkloadSpec` field is set.
- `pkg/catalog/` — Maps `{domain, variant}` → WorkflowSpec builder via `init()` registration. Adding a category = one new Go file.
- `pkg/nodemonitor/` — `NodeFailureDetector` interface; the CEL implementation evaluates expressions against Node objects. Detectors are selected by which typed field is set on `Job.spec.nodeHealthMonitor` (same pattern as workload adapters), not by name lookup.
- `pkg/goodput/` — Log parsing (`parser.go`), goodput calculation (`calculator.go`), pod log reading (`reader.go` with `PodLogFetcher` interface for test injection).
- `pkg/orchestration/` — Node partitioning: simple (name-sorted chunking), topology-aware (greedy domain-based allocation), and bisection (used internally by `diagnose` for adaptive fault isolation).
- `pkg/gpu/` — GPU architecture detection and defaults (gpusPerNode, MNNVL).
- `pkg/naming/` — Resource naming conventions and helpers.
- `pkg/nccl/` — NCCL log parsing for bandwidth measurement results.
- `pkg/podlogs/` — Pod log fetching abstraction (`PodLogFetcher` interface).
- `pkg/podutil/` — Pod status inspection and readiness utilities.
- `pkg/controller/workflow_detect.go` — Auto-detects platform from `spec.providerID` and GPU architecture from `nvidia.com/gpu.product` label for override matching.

### Controller Patterns

- `setExclusiveCondition()` makes InProgress/Succeeded/Failed mutually exclusive at every tier
- Each tier uses `Owns()` for event-driven reconciliation; polling as safety net
- Configurable requeue intervals: tests use 1s, production uses 15s
- Child resource creation: deep-copy spec → set labels → `SetControllerReference()` → Create()
- Reason constants use tier-specific prefixes: `reasonWorkload*` (Job), `reasonJob*` (Workflow), `reasonWorkflow*` (Certification)

### Testing

Integration tests use envtest with golden file comparison in `cmd/integration/testdata/reconcile/`. Each test case is a directory with `input_client_objects.yaml`, `input_config.yaml`, and `expected.json`. `PodLogFetcher` interface enables deterministic goodput tests via `input_logs_*.txt` files.

Structured output in these packages MUST go through `testutil.TestCaseParser` (in `pkg/testutil/`) with testdata directories and golden files, the same pattern as integration tests but at the package level. A hand-maintained table of structured output is not accepted in them:

`pkg/catalog/`, `pkg/certification/`, `pkg/cluster/`, `pkg/controller/`, `pkg/goodput/`, `pkg/nodemonitor/cel/`, `pkg/orchestration/`, `pkg/platform/`, `pkg/podlogs/`, `pkg/render/`, `pkg/report/`, `pkg/workload/`, `pkg/workloadrun/`, `cmd/manager/`, `test/helm/`

Table tests remain fine in any package for nil-safety pins, concurrency guards, and single-value assertions, and for trivial helpers in `pkg/gpu/`, `pkg/naming/`, `pkg/nccl/`, `pkg/threshold/`, `pkg/numstr/`, `pkg/noderesults/`, `pkg/setup/`. Those exceptions are live inside required packages: `pkg/controller/status_test.go` and `pkg/controller/parser_cache_test.go` pin retry-budget and cache-identity behavior with tables. `test/releasepolicy/` and `test/docspolicy/` are table-driven by design. When in doubt, match the cases already in the package's `testdata/`.

The full testing guide is in `.claude/skills/cre-test/SKILL.md`: golden file rules, the integration test input format, and the canonical example. Read that file directly. It is plain Markdown and needs no particular tool.

Release-path workflows are tested in `test/releasepolicy/`. `attest.yml`'s input validation is shell embedded in YAML — nothing type-checks it, and a weakened guard would not break a build, it would just stop rejecting things. The tests extract that step from the workflow and execute it against a table of accept and reject cases, so the test cannot drift from the validation it covers:

```bash
go test ./test/releasepolicy/ -run TestAttestValidationRejects -v
```

## Critical Pitfalls

- **After modifying `*_types.go`**: Must run `make manifests generate` before anything else compiles (stale deepcopy). `make manifests` writes CRDs directly to `helm/cluster-readiness-engine/crds/` and RBAC to `helm/cluster-readiness-engine/templates/`.
- **Blank imports required**: `pkg/catalog` must be blank-imported in `cmd/nvcrectl/main.go` and test suites to trigger `init()` registration.
- **envtest has no GC controller**: Cascade deletion via OwnerReference won't work in tests. Controllers must explicitly delete child resources in `handleDeletion()`.
- **`runtime.RawExtension` with `json:",inline"`**: Loses sibling fields during marshal/unmarshal. Requires custom `MarshalJSON`/`UnmarshalJSON` on the parent struct (see `api/v1alpha1/dependency_json.go`).
- **Test timeout is 10s**: If requeue interval > 10s, status update tests will time out.
- **`Trainer.NumProcPerNode`** is `*intstr.IntOrString` — use `intstr.FromInt32()`, not `*int32`.
- **Never edit auto-generated files**: `helm/cluster-readiness-engine/crds/*.yaml`, `helm/cluster-readiness-engine/templates/role*.yaml`, `helm/cluster-readiness-engine/templates/*_role*.yaml`, `helm/cluster-readiness-engine/templates/service_account.yaml`, `**/zz_generated.*.go`, `PROJECT`.
- **Never remove scaffold markers**: `// +kubebuilder:scaffold:*` comments are used by the CLI.

## Development Workflow (MANDATORY)

Every feature, behavioral change, or non-trivial modification MUST follow this process. Do not skip steps.

### 1. Plan Mode First

Always start new features or significant changes in **plan mode** (`EnterPlanMode`). Explore the codebase, understand the existing patterns, and design your approach before writing any code. Present the plan to the user for approval.

### 2. Write an ADR

Before implementing, write an Architecture Decision Record in `docs/designs/`. Follow the existing format (see ADR-002 through ADR-015):

```
docs/designs/NNN-short-description.md
```

Structure: Context → Decision → Implementation → Rationale → Consequences → Alternatives Considered → Notes → References

The ADR must be **approved by the user** before implementation begins. The ADR should read as a forward-looking design document — not a retroactive justification.

### 3. Implement

Write the code. Follow existing patterns (adapter pattern, `setExclusiveCondition()`, tier-specific reason constants, `Owns()` watches, etc.). Refer to the ADR and the codebase architecture below.

### 4. Update Everything

After implementation, update **all** affected artifacts — do not stop partway:

- **Tests**: Add/update integration test cases in `cmd/integration/testdata/reconcile/` with golden files
- **Golden files**: Run `TESTUTIL_UPDATE_EXPECTED=true make test-integration` to regenerate. **NEVER blindly overwrite golden files when tests are failing** — investigate and fix the code or test inputs first. Only regenerate golden files when the new output is intentionally correct. For new tests that require golden file generation, thoroughly review the generated `expected.json` before considering the test complete. **NEVER silently regenerate golden files during implementation** — always stop and ask the user for explicit permission before regenerating any golden file, explaining what changed and why. **Always diagnose first**: before updating any integration golden file, read the existing expected.json, understand what fields are changing and why, and confirm the change is an expected consequence of the code changes — never jump straight to regeneration.
- **Documentation**: Update `docs/` files if API or behavior changed
- **Site**: The public docs site is built with Fern from `docs/` (site config in `fern/docs.yml`, nav in `docs/index.yml`). Update the relevant `docs/` pages if user-facing behavior changed, and add new pages to `docs/index.yml` so they appear in the published nav
- **Samples**: Update `config/samples/` if new fields or resources were added

### 5. Run Verification Until Green

Run the full verification suite and **do not stop until all commands pass**:

```bash
make manifests generate    # Regenerate CRDs and DeepCopy (MUST run after *_types.go changes)
make lint-fix              # Auto-fix lint issues
make build                 # Verify compilation
make test                  # Unit + integration tests
```

If tests fail, fix the issue and re-run. Do not present failing tests to the user. If you are stuck after two attempts, stop and ask the user for guidance.

### 5b. Do Not Push Without Confirmation

**Never run `git push` unless the user explicitly asks.** After committing, wait for the user to confirm before pushing. This applies to all branches.

### 6. Ask When Unsure

If you are uncertain about:
- Which pattern to follow → Read the relevant ADR in `docs/designs/`
- How a controller works → Read the source and existing tests
- What the user wants → **Stop and ask**. Do not guess at requirements.

Never assume. A question costs seconds; a wrong implementation costs a rewrite.

## Testing Catalog Config Changes with nvcrectl

When modifying catalog entries (`pkg/catalog/entries/`), use `nvcrectl certification render` to verify the rendered Workflow manifests are correct before committing.

### Build nvcrectl

```bash
go build -ldflags "-s -w" -o bin/nvcrectl ./cmd/nvcrectl/
```

### Create Test Certification YAMLs

Create a temp cert file per GPU architecture. Change `nvidia.com/gpu.product`, `enableMNNVL`, and `nodesPerJob` to match the target. Find valid `domain`/`variant` pairs from directory names under `pkg/catalog/entries/<domain>/<variant>/`.

```yaml
# /tmp/cert-gb300.yaml
apiVersion: nvcre.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: Certification
metadata:
  name: gpu-cluster-cert
spec:
  target:
    nodeSelector:
      nvidia.com/gpu.product: NVIDIA-GB300  # NVIDIA-GB200, NVIDIA-GB300, or NVIDIA-H100-80GB-HBM3
  nodesPerJob: 8
  enableMNNVL: true   # true for GB200/GB300 (multi-node NVLink), false for H100 and others
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: nvcrectl-pull-secret
  categories:
    - domain: training
      variant: nemotron5-8b
      options:
        maxSteps: 50
```

### Render and Verify

```bash
# Render only (works without a cluster, or when cluster arch doesn't match the cert)
./bin/nvcrectl certification render --platform aws /tmp/cert-gb300.yaml

# Render + dry-run (validates resources against the live cluster API server;
# kubeconfig context MUST point to a cluster matching the cert's target architecture)
./bin/nvcrectl certification render --platform aws /tmp/cert-gb300.yaml --dry-run
```

### What to Verify in Output

1. **Override tracking** — Check `nvcrectl.nvidia.com/applied-overrides` annotation to confirm the right overrides matched, and `detected-gpu-architecture`/`detected-platform` are correct.

2. **Architecture-specific env vars** — `FI_EFA_USE_DEVICE_RDMA` should ONLY appear for GB200 and H100 on AWS (EFA interconnect), NOT for GB300 (RoCE).

   `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `PATH` are **not** EFA markers. GB300 on AWS sets them on purpose (`pkg/catalog/entries/_lib/nccl/aws-gb300-roce-env.yaml`), pointing at `/opt/amazon/openmpi/lib`, which is correct on an AWS instance whatever the interconnect. Do not treat them as leakage.

3. **Resources by architecture**:
   - GB200: `hugepages-2Mi: 10256Mi`, `vpc.amazonaws.com/efa: 4`, `amazon-efa` hostPath volume
   - GB300: `roce-channel` resource claim with `roce.networking.k8s.aws`, NO hugepages, NO EFA
   - H100: `vpc.amazonaws.com/efa: 32`, NO hugepages, NO ComputeDomain

4. **Spot-check with grep**. Use only markers that really are EFA specific:

   ```bash
   # Should return NOTHING for GB300 (RoCE)
   ./bin/nvcrectl certification render --platform aws /tmp/cert-gb300.yaml 2>&1 \
     | grep -E "FI_EFA|hugepages|vpc.amazonaws.com/efa"

   # Should show all three for GB200 (EFA)
   ./bin/nvcrectl certification render --platform aws /tmp/cert-gb200.yaml 2>&1 \
     | grep -E "FI_EFA|hugepages|vpc.amazonaws.com/efa"

   # And GB300 should show RoCE instead
   ./bin/nvcrectl certification render --platform aws /tmp/cert-gb300.yaml 2>&1 | grep -c roce
   ```

   Rendered counts for `communication/nccl-all-reduce` on AWS, for reference:

   | Pattern | gb200 | gb300 |
   |---|---|---|
   | `FI_EFA` | 2 | 0 |
   | `hugepages` | 2 | 0 |
   | `vpc.amazonaws.com/efa` | 2 | 0 |
   | `roce` | 0 | 6 |

### Override Semantics (Critical)

- **`jobTemplate`** in an override uses strategic merge patch. **Arrays (like `env`) are REPLACED entirely**, not merged by name. If an override sets `jobTemplate.spec.workload.trainJob.trainer.env`, it wipes out the base env and replaces with only the listed vars.
- **`jobTemplatePatch`** uses RFC 6902 JSON Patch. Use `op: add` with `path: /spec/workload/trainJob/trainer/env/-` to **append** env vars without replacing the existing list. The `-` means "end of array".
- Overrides are applied **in order** as listed in the YAML. A `jobTemplatePatch` must come after any `jobTemplate` override that sets the env array, otherwise the appended vars get wiped.

## Git Configuration

- Commit to the `main` branch (not `master`).
- Sign every commit with both `-S` (cryptographic signature) and `-s` (DCO sign-off): `git commit -S -s -m "..."`.
- Author every commit as the human (the configured `git config user.name` / `user.email`), never as the agent.
- Do NOT add `Co-Authored-By` lines or any agent attribution (e.g. Claude Code, Codex, Copilot). This is organization policy.
- Do NOT add "Generated with Claude Code", "Created by Codex", or similar attribution to commit messages, PR bodies, PR comments, or code comments.

The reason is accountability, not credit. The human author takes full responsibility for every line they submit, including code an agent generated. Splitting authorship with a tool blurs that line, and the DCO sign-off is a certification a person makes, not a tool.

Nothing in CI inspects commit authorship, so these rules hold by convention. The DCO app (`probot.github.io/apps/dco`) runs on every PR and validates the `Signed-off-by` trailer only: a commit missing `-s` fails that check, but an attributed commit passes it. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#ai-assisted-contributions) for the accountability rules that go with AI-assisted work.

## Agent Permissions

**Always allowed** (no confirmation needed):
- Read any file in the repository.
- Edit code under `pkg/`, `cmd/`, `api/`, `test/`, and docs under `docs/`.
- Run `make lint`, `make test`, `make build`, and `make manifests generate`.

**Ask the user first**:
- Regenerate integration golden files (`TESTUTIL_UPDATE_EXPECTED=true`).
- Add or upgrade dependencies in `go.mod`.
- Change CRD schemas (`api/v1alpha1/*_types.go`).
- Create an ADR in `docs/designs/`.
- Push branches or open pull requests.

**Never do**:
- Never commit credentials, secrets, API keys, or tokens. Do not write them to code, tests, logs, or documentation. Use environment variables and Kubernetes Secrets instead.
- Never edit auto-generated files: `helm/cluster-readiness-engine/crds/*.yaml`, the generated `role*.yaml` and `service_account.yaml` templates, `**/zz_generated.*.go`, and `PROJECT`.
- Never remove `// +kubebuilder:scaffold:*` markers.
- Never create git tags. The user creates tags.
- Never push to `main`.
- Never attribute a commit or PR to an AI agent. No `Co-Authored-By` trailers, no "Generated with" footers, no agent name in the author field.

## Good and Bad Examples

```go
// Good: Trainer.NumProcPerNode is *intstr.IntOrString.
trainer.NumProcPerNode = ptr.To(intstr.FromInt32(8))

// Bad: does not compile. The field is not *int32.
trainer.NumProcPerNode = ptr.To(int32(8))
```

```go
// Good: use setExclusiveCondition so InProgress, Succeeded, and
// Failed stay mutually exclusive on every tier.
setExclusiveCondition(&job.Status.Conditions, condition)

// Bad: appending conditions directly leaves two phases true at once.
job.Status.Conditions = append(job.Status.Conditions, condition)
```
