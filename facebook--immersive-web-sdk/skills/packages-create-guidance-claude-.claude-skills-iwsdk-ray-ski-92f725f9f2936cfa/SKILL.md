# Ray Interaction

Point at and interact with objects or UI elements in the XR scene using the controller ray. The workflow has a **required core** (steps 1-4) and **optional extensions** that depend on whether the target is an object or UI element, and what kind of interaction is needed.

User request is in `$ARGUMENTS`.

## Required Core

These steps always execute in order.

### Step 1: Enter XR

Check session status. If not in an active XR session, accept and enter.

```
xr_get_session_status → if not sessionActive → xr_accept_session
```

### Step 2: Locate the target

**For scene objects:** Find a live entity by name or interaction component, then
query its component data.

```
ecs_find_entities({namePattern: target}) → ecs_query_entity(entityIndex)
```

**For UI elements:** start from the stable UIKitML identities instead of trying to
discover an internal panel component:

1. Read the UIKITML source file to find the element's `id` (e.g., `<button id="xr-button">`)
2. Find the manifest asset ID and the placed scene node whose `content.asset` uses it
3. In application code, resolve the placed `UIKitMLAsset` with
   `world.requireSceneObject(sceneNodeId)` and resolve the element with
   `requireElementById(elementId)`
4. Add an application-level test hook exposing the element's world target when the
   runtime tools need a precise point to aim at

If the element already has a name in the hierarchy, skip straight to getting its transform.

If the object is not found, report the available named objects and stop.

### Step 3: Get its transform

Read the target's Transform position from the queried entity or application test
hook from step 2.

```
ecs_query_entity(entityIndex) → Transform.position
```

### Step 4: Aim the controller

Point the controller at the target. Default to `"controller-right"` unless the user specified left. Do NOT move the controller — only rotate it.

```
xr_look_at({ device: "controller-right", target: { x, y, z } })
```

The controller ray is now pointing at the target. What happens next depends on the interaction type.

## Interaction Branches

Based on the user's intent and the target's components, choose ONE of the following.

### Branch A: Click / Select (objects with RayInteractable, or UI buttons)

For simple clicks, send an explicit trigger press and release. Use for UI buttons and objects that respond to the Pressed component.

```
xr_set_select_value({ device: "controller-right", value: 1 })
xr_set_select_value({ device: "controller-right", value: 0 })
```

This explicit press/release sequence is deterministic and makes the held state visible
between the two commands.

### Branch B: Distance Grab (objects with DistanceGrabbable)

DistanceGrabbable requires **press and hold** on the trigger (button index 0), not a quick select.

#### B1: Engage trigger

```
xr_set_gamepad_state({
  device: "controller-right",
  buttons: [{ index: 0, value: 1 }],
})
```

The object is now distance-grabbed. Behavior depends on the `movementMode`:

- **MoveFromTarget / MoveAtSource / RotateAtSource** — object stays remote, moves relative to controller movement
- **MoveTowardsTarget** — object flies into the controller's hand, then behaves like a proximity grab

#### B2: Move to destination (optional)

If the user wants to move the object somewhere, animate the controller to the destination.

```
xr_animate_to({
  device: "controller-right",
  position: { x, y, z },
  duration: 0.5,
})
```

If no destination specified but user asked to "move" or "bring" the object, animate to in front of the headset: `xr_get_transform({ "device": "headset" })` → place at `(head.x, head.y - 0.2, head.z - 0.5)`.

#### B3: Release trigger

```
xr_set_gamepad_state({
  device: "controller-right",
  buttons: [{ index: 0, value: 0 }],
})
```

#### B4: Return controller

Animate back to resting position.

```
xr_animate_to({
  device: "controller-right",
  position: { x: 0.2, y: 1.4, z: -0.3 },
  duration: 0.5,
})
```

Default resting positions: right `(0.2, 1.4, -0.3)`, left `(-0.2, 1.4, -0.3)`.

### Step 5: Verify (optional)

Take a screenshot to confirm the result.

```
browser_screenshot
```

`browser_screenshot` is runtime-only. If the editor is visible, the managed workspace
switches to runtime before capture.

## Notes

- **Click vs hold:** use `xr_set_select_value` 1→0 for quick clicks. Hold it at 1 while moving a DistanceGrabbable, then release with 0.
- **Trigger vs squeeze:** Ray interactions use the **trigger (button index 0)**. Proximity grabs (OneHandGrabbable/TwoHandsGrabbable) use **squeeze (button index 1)**. Don't mix them up.
- **UI element discovery:** use manifest asset ID → stable scene node ID → UIKitML
  element ID. Expose a test hook for the resolved element when a world-space aim target
  is needed. Guessing from panel offsets or transient entity indices is fragile.
- **DistanceGrabbable movement modes:** Check the entity's DistanceGrabbable component to see which `movementMode` is set. Use `ecs_query_entity` if unsure.
- **Don't move the controller to the target** — ray interactions work at a distance. Only rotate via `xr_look_at`, don't translate.
