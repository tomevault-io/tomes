# IWSDK project

A Vite + TypeScript or JavaScript app, but several things do **not** work the way
a normal Vite project works. Read this section before assuming anything.

Deeper material is installed in each selected harness's native path-scoped rule
format. Harnesses that use `AGENTS.md` also receive equivalent nested files near
the code they govern. Read the applicable scoped instructions before working in
that area.

## What is not standard Vite

**`iwsdk.config.json` is the project authority, not `vite.config.ts`.** It selects
the active scene, the asset module, the component module, and all XR/world
features. `vite.config.ts` only wires the plugin. Editing `iwsdk.config.json`
restarts Vite in place; the managed window remains open and its command bridges
reconnect automatically. Wait for `npx iwsdk dev status` to report
`browserCommandReady: true` before issuing browser-backed commands.

**`virtual:iwsdk-project` is a virtual module**, not a file. `src/index.ts` or
`src/index.js` imports it and passes it whole to `World.create()`. Do not
hand-build that options object.

**The dev server is CLI-managed.** Use `npx iwsdk dev up` (or `npm run dev`), not
`vite`. It launches a managed browser that hosts the MCP command bridge.
`--no-open` intentionally starts only the server: status reports
`browser.status: "not_launched"`, and browser-backed commands fail immediately
with `browser_not_launched` plus restart guidance. One managed window hosts two
roles, editor and runtime.

**`src/assets.ts`/`src/assets.js` is evaluated twice, in two different JS
realms** — once by the app runtime, once by the editor. It must be deterministic
and side-effect free: no `World`, no DOM, no timers, no reliance on shared object
identity.

**Static geometry lives in TypeScript, composition lives in JSON.** Scene JSON
never declares URLs, geometry or materials — only manifest IDs.

**Components must be declared in a system-free module** and exported from
`src/components.ts`/`src/components.js` via `defineComponents()`. The editor
imports that same manifest to build its inspector, so a component that is not in
it cannot be authored in scenes.

**Import Three.js from `@iwsdk/core`, never from `three`.** `@iwsdk/core`
re-exports all of Three; importing `three` directly creates a duplicate instance
and subtle breakage. Exception: `import type { GLTF } from 'three/addons/...'`.

## Traps that produce silent failures

## Verify before you claim it works

**Always `npx tsc --noEmit` before testing.** Type errors stop systems
initialising without necessarily logging anything in the browser.

Then check the right status for the task — these are not interchangeable:

- scene/editor work → `scene_get_state`
- XR device or session actions → `xr_get_session_status`
- server readiness → `npx iwsdk dev status` (XR availability is not a server signal)

When something is missing but the console is clean: call
`browser_get_console_logs` with only `count` (a `level` filter hides errors), then
`ecs_find_entities` to confirm the entity exists and carries the components you
expect.

The non-obvious part is which observation proves what: the **editor** render does
not run application systems, so anything driven by a system must be verified with
`browser_screenshot` (runtime), not `scene_screenshot` (editor).

## MCP and CLI are one surface, not two

Nearly every capability exists both ways — `scene_render_file` and
`npx iwsdk scene render-file`, `ecs_find_entities` and `npx iwsdk ecs find`.
Discover CLI actions with the bare domain or domain help (`npx iwsdk scene` or
`npx iwsdk scene --help`); both list that domain's actions.

**The CLI is not a fallback for a dead bridge.** Both routes drive the same
managed browser, so when `dev status` reports `browserConnected: false`,
every scene/ecs/xr/browser/ui command fails either way. Only `dev status`,
`dev logs` and `reference status` work without a browser.

Choose by the shape of the call, not by availability:

- **MCP** for one-off calls, and whenever you want the image returned inline.
- **CLI** when you need to loop or script — rendering six views, or sampling a
  value twice to measure a rate — or when the response is big enough to be worth
  filtering before it reaches context. A render of a scene containing an
  instanced pattern returns an id for every expanded instance.

CLI `--output-file` returns a **different payload shape** from the plain call:
the result nests under `data.result` instead of `data`, and `renderStats` and the
hashes are dropped. If you need a hash or triangle count, omit `--output-file`
and filter the JSON instead.

## Skills

Scene composition, UI authoring, physics, depth occlusion, grab and ray
interaction testing, ECS frame-stepping, and end-to-end planning each have a
project skill in the selected harness's standard skill directory. Their
descriptions handle routing, so they are not restated here.

The failure worth guarding against is improvising a domain that already has a
skill because the naive approach looks tractable. Before hand-authoring scene
JSON, a UIKitML panel, or a physics body, invoke the skill.

## Layout

```
iwsdk.config.json      project authority: scene, assets, components, world, dev
src/index.ts|js        World.create() + explicit system registration
src/assets.ts|js       defineAssets() — shared runtime/editor catalog
src/components.ts|js   defineComponents() — shared runtime/editor catalog
src/scene-assets/      *.scene-asset.ts|js — parentless Object3D prototypes
public/scenes/         *.iwsdk.scene.json — composition only
public/ui/             *.uikitml — runtime-loaded panels
```

No barrel `index.ts` files. Keep component declarations free of system, DOM and
renderer imports; systems import the declarations, never the reverse.

## Conventions

- Systems use queries, never manually tracked entity arrays.
- Never allocate in `update()`. Allocate in `init()` as class properties.
- Prefer `queries.x.subscribe('qualify', ...)` over polling state each frame.
- Register every subscription teardown in `this.cleanupFuncs`.
- Use `signal.peek()` in `update()`; `.value` adds per-frame subscription overhead.
- Load assets through `AssetManager` / the manifest, never a raw `GLTFLoader`.
- Create entities with `world.createTransformEntity(...)`, never `scene.add()`.
- Use the `RayInteractable` component, never a manual `Raycaster`.
- VR targets 72–90 fps: 11–14 ms per frame. Treat per-frame allocation as a bug.

## Deep reference

Harness-native scoped rules cover `public/scenes/**`, `public/ui/**`,
`src/assets.ts`, `src/scene-assets/**`, and `src/**/*.ts`. `AGENTS.md`-based
harnesses receive nested instruction files; Cursor and Copilot receive their
native rule formats. Skill procedures live in the selected harness's project
skill directory and state when they apply.
