# Using gtm-skills

## Overview

205 skills. 24 categories. Every GTM discipline. This is the master key.
The mistake: cloning the repo and not knowing where to start — loading random
skills, missing dependencies, or treating skills as documentation instead of
executable playbooks. This skill covers the complete usage guide: installation,
discovery, loading patterns, multi-skill workflows, and advanced tactics for
getting maximum value from the gtm-skills library.

### Skill Map: Winning by Design — Sales Process & GTM System

WbD organizes revenue as a system, not a funnel. Load skills by model:

| WbD Component | What It Covers | Load These Skills |
|---|---|---|
| **GTM Index (6 models)** | Revenue, Data, Math, Operating, Growth, GTM — score 1–10 | `gtm-system-architecture`, `gtm-metrics` |
| **GTM Playbook Kit** | Goal + Actions + Exit Criteria per stage | `pipeline-management` (anchor) |
| **SPICED** | Situation, Pain, Impact, Critical Event, Decision (discovery) | `pipeline-management`, `meeting-prep`, `founder-sales` |
| **MEDDICC** | Metrics, EB, Decision Criteria/Process, Pain, Champion, Competition (deal scoring) | `pipeline-management`, `meeting-prep`, `sales-coaching`, `multi-thread-orchestration` |
| **Bowtie** | Acquire → retain → expand (revenue doesn't end at Closed Won) | `gtm-system-architecture`, `customer-onboarding`, `expansion-selling` |
| **POD structures** | SDR:AE:CSM ratios by complexity | `sales-team-building` |
| **REKS coaching** | Results → Efforts → Knowledge → Skills | `sales-coaching`, `sales-team-building` |
| **Enablement layer** | Playbook, battlecards, talk tracks per stage | `sales-enablement`, `demo-scripts`, `objection-handling` |

**Full WbD sales process stack:**
```
gtm-context → gtm-system-architecture (score the 6 models)
→ pipeline-management (stages + SPICED + handoffs)
→ sales-enablement (playbook assets per stage)
→ sales-coaching (REKS + deal inspection)
→ sales-team-building (PODs + hiring when Operating Model ≥6)
```

**SPICED + MEDDICC rule:** They do not contradict. SPICED runs discovery
conversations; MEDDICC scores deal evidence. Same CRM fields — see
`pipeline-management` reconciliation table. Never use both as competing checklists.

**Gap Selling layer:** Keenan adds diagnostic depth — current/future/gap, root
cause, emotions, Problem Identification Chart. Use on discovery calls (`meeting-prep`
→ `keenan-gap-selling.md`); fold Impact into SPICED + MEDDICC Metrics.

### Skill Map: Outbound & Discovery Experts

Router index → `references/gtm-experts-outbound-index.md`

| Task | Skill | Lead expert / artifact |
|---|---|---|
| Discovery call prep | `meeting-prep` | Keenan Gap Selling + SPICED + MEDDICC gaps |
| Discovery stage gates | `pipeline-management` | Gap Selling exit criteria (no happy ears) |
| Sequence architecture | `cold-email-strategy` | Becc Holland structure · Guillaume multichannel · Jordan PQS/PVP |
| Write cold email copy | `cold-email-copywriting` | Becc 7 Pillars · Guillaume CTC · Crawford PVP bar |
| Low reply rates (good infra) | `cold-email-strategy` + `list-building` | Jordan Crawford FIND — fix message before volume |
| lemlist campaign setup | `lemlist-setup` | Guillaume playbook (canonical multichannel) |
| Email + LinkedIn coordination | `multi-channel-outreach` | Guillaume · Becc sequence structure |
| SDR KPI / inbound-outbound conflict | `sales-team-building` | Becc Holland lead weighting |
| Infra at scale / deliverability | `email-deliverability`, `domain-infrastructure` | Eric Nowoslawski — `eric-nowoslawski-outbound.md` |
| Creative Ideas / offer-led AI copy | `cold-email-copywriting`, `clay-automation` | Eric Nowoslawski Crawl Walk Run |
| Outbound unit economics gate | `cold-email-strategy` | Eric TAM/LTV/CAC:LTV criteria |

**Creative outbound stack (reply rate rescue):**
```
list-building (PQS from won deals) → cold-email-strategy (FIND + triggers)
→ cold-email-copywriting (PVP/CTC copy) → lemlist-setup or sending-platforms
```

**Discovery stack:**
```
meeting-prep (Gap Selling + SPICED questions) → pipeline-management (stage evidence)
→ sales-coaching (MEDDICC deal review)
```

**WbD + agency rule:** Do not hire agencies until Operating Model ≥6.
Load `pipeline-management` before `hiring-agencies` — agencies execute your
playbook, they do not write it.

**Full Roberge stack (building the machine):**
```

→ sales-team-building → hiring-by-role → sales-coaching → gtm-metrics
```

### Skill Map: Survival to Thrival — Enterprise Sales

*From Survival to Thrival* (Lemkin + Roberge) defines two phases. Enterprise is a Thrival-stage motion — do not skip Survival.

**Phase 1 — Survival ($0–$2M ARR):** Founder is the sales team. Prove repeatability before hiring.

| Task | Skill | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Establish context | `gtm-context` | Every downstream skill needs ICP, motion, and constraints |
| Founder selling | `founder-sales` | Survival phase core — close 10–20 deals yourself first |
| ICP definition | `icp-scoring`, `positioning-messaging` | Know who buys and why before scaling |
| Discovery & demos | `meeting-prep`, `demo-scripts` | SPICED/MEDDIC qualification from day one |
| Pricing & packaging | `pricing-strategy`, `deal-desk` | ACV determines motion — enterprise needs $50K+ ACV path |
| Solo/bootstrap path | `solo-founder-gtm` | If no funding, tighter Survival constraints |

**Phase 2 — Thrival ($2M–$10M+ ARR):** Build the repeatable sales machine. Roberge's territory.

| Task | Skill | Why |
|---|---|---|
| First sales hires | `sales-team-building` | Correct hire sequence by ARR — AE before SDR, no VP too early |
| Sales process | `pipeline-management` | Stage goals + exit criteria — inspect the process, not just results |
| Enablement | `sales-enablement` | Playbook, battlecards, onboarding — train at scale |
| Coaching | `sales-coaching`, `team-management` | REKS diagnostics, deal reviews |
| RevOps foundation | `gtm-metrics`, `crm-integration` | Data model before headcount |

**Phase 3 — Enterprise upmarket (Thrival extension):** Long cycles, buying committees, security gates.

| Task | Skill | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Tier segmentation | `icp-targeting-tiers` | Enterprise ≠ mid-market — different ACV, cycle, stakeholders |
| ABM program | `abm-strategy`, `account-selection` | Named accounts, tier scoring, channel orchestration |
| Multi-threading | `multi-thread-orchestration` | Survive champion departure — engage the buying committee |
| Economic buyer | `meeting-prep`, `roi-calculator`, `deal-desk` | MEDDIC + business case for $100K+ deals |
| Security unblock | `soc2-compliance`, `data-privacy-compliance`, `security-assessments` | Enterprise procurement gates |
| GTM data exchange / rep hygiene | `deal-desk`, `customer-onboarding`, `revenue-team-onboarding`, `references/gtm-data-exchange-playbook.md` | Safe customer data handling in sales + CS |
| Transparency | `transparency-selling`, `objection-handling` | Enterprise buyers reward honesty over hype |

**Survival → Thrival → Enterprise load sequence:**
```
Survival:   gtm-context → founder-sales → meeting-prep → pricing-strategy
Thrival:    sales-team-building → pipeline-management → sales-enablement → sales-coaching
Enterprise: icp-targeting-tiers → abm-strategy → multi-thread-orchestration → roi-calculator → soc2-compliance
```

### Skill Map: Journey / PMF / Scale Gates

Founder company journey: **idea → PMF search → GTM fit → scale → optimize → exit optionality**.
Canonical home: `saas-outcomes` (journey + exit); `solo-founder-gtm` (PMF + scale gates).

| Task | Skill | Artifact |
|---|---|---|
| Where am I on the journey? | `saas-outcomes` | `journey-planning-worksheet.md` |
| Stage go/no-go gates | `saas-outcomes` | `journey-stage-gates.md` |
| Test product-market fit | `solo-founder-gtm` | `pmf-testing-playbook.md` |
| PMF signal checklist | `solo-founder-gtm` | `pmf-signal-checklist.md` |
| Ready to scale headcount/spend? | `solo-founder-gtm` | `scale-readiness-gates.md` |
| Stop scaling (anti-patterns) | `solo-founder-gtm` | `when-not-to-scale.md` |
| Exit realistic vs distraction? | `saas-outcomes` | `exit-potential-scorecard.md` |
| Bootstrap capital discipline | `saas-outcomes` | `bootstrap-founder-playbook.md`, `bootstrap-capital-plan.md` |
| M&A prep (if score ≥4.0) | `exiting-company` | `buyer-readiness-checklist.md` |
| Earn-out / LOI structure | `exiting-company` | `negotiating-earn-out.md`, `earn-out-term-sheet-review.md` |
| Hold vs sell economics | `financial-modeling` | `unit-economics-exit-bridge.md` |
| Stage-appropriate spend | `gtm-spend-management` | `spend-governance.md` |
| Hire after scale gates pass | `sales-team-building` | hiring sequence by ARR |

**Journey load sequence:**
```
gtm-context → saas-outcomes (journey-stage-gates) → solo-founder-gtm (PMF tests)
→ scale-readiness-gates → sales-team-building (if go) → gtm-spend-management
→ saas-outcomes (exit-potential-scorecard) → exiting-company (if active optionality)
→ exiting-company (negotiating-earn-out) if LOI includes deferred consideration
```

**Pattern 32 shortcut (earn-out or bootstrap exit):** `bootstrap-founder-playbook.md` OR `negotiating-earn-out.md` → `benchmark-reconciliation.md` → `valuation-sensitivity-table.md` / `earn-out-term-sheet-review.md`

**Go / no-go rule:** Do not load `sales-team-building` until `scale-readiness-gates.md` passes.
If `when-not-to-scale.md` stop signals active — fix churn/economics first.

### Quick Reference: Top 10 Most-Used Skills

| # | Skill | Use For |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `cold-email-strategy` | Building outreach sequences |
| 2 | `pitch-deck-builder` | Investor and sales presentations |
| 3 | `founder-sales` | Founder-led sales motion |
| 4 | `fundraising-strategy` | Raising capital |
| 5 | `vibe-marketing` | AI-powered marketing at scale |
| 6 | `financial-modeling` | P&L, runway, DCF valuation |
| 7 | `gtm-metrics` | SaaS metrics dashboard |
| 8 | `lead-finding` | Prospecting and list building |
| 9 | `sales-enablement` | Decks, one-pagers, battlecards |
| 10 | `solo-founder-gtm` | Bootstrapper GTM playbook |

## Loading and Combining Skills

### Single Skill
```
"Load the founder-sales skill and help me with [task]"
```

### Multiple Skills (Workflow)
```
"I need to: 1) find leads, 2) write cold emails, 3) set up domains.
Load lead-finding, cold-email-copywriting, and domain-infrastructure."
```

### Dependency Chain (Auto-Load)
Skills declare dependencies in their frontmatter. Your agent should load
dependencies automatically. Example: `founder-sales` depends on `pricing-strategy`
and `sales-enablement`. When you load `founder-sales`, your agent should
also load its dependencies.

### The "Full Stack" Pattern
For complex GTM projects, load the entire stack:
```
"Build a complete outbound engine for [company]. Load:
- lead-finding, lead-enrichment, email-finding, contact-verification (prospecting)
- cold-email-strategy, email-deliverability, domain-infrastructure (outbound)
- clay-automation (automation)
- gtm-metrics (analytics)"
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Pattern 1: Research → Build → Launch
```
1. competitive-intel + positioning-messaging (research the market)
2. pitch-deck-builder + pricing-strategy (build the assets)
3. launch-planning + content-marketing (launch)
```

### Pattern 2: Hire → Onboard → Manage
```
1. gtm-role-descriptions (JD + org + IC comp templates — H1 2026 bands)
2. founder-comp-playbook (founder: afford hire, value package, negotiate)
3. executive-compensation (VP/CRO clauses + Sam Jacobs / Pavilion gates)
4. gtm-recruiting (source, close, offer negotiate)
5. job-posting-strategy (distribute) + hiring-by-role (interviewer + candidate questions, re:Work scorecard)
6. revenue-team-onboarding (onboarding questions both sides, 30-60-90, Slack, certification)
7. employment-compliance (offer letter) + gtm-leadership (manage, PIP/fire/resignation handoff)
8. team-management + sales-coaching (1:1s, REKS — Jacco van der Kooij / WbD)
```

### Pattern 10: Reviews & Advocacy (G2 / TrustRadius)
```
1. review-platforms (profile, generation cadence, response playbook)
2. customer-marketing (case studies, reference program)
3. competitive-intel (competitor review themes → battlecards)
4. inbound-triage (G2 intent → CRM)
```

### Pattern 11: GTM Stack Finance & Spend
```
1. revops-tech-stack (what you need — consolidate first)
2. gtm-tool-cost-model (seat + credit + cloud TCO)
3. gtm-spend-management (Ramp, vendor roster, approvals, renewals)
4. financial-modeling (OpEx in P&L)
5. vendor-contracts (renewal negotiation)
```

### Pattern 13: Sales Coaching System (REKS → MEDDICC → JOLT)
```
1. pipeline-management (stages + MEDDICC gates + SPICED fields)
2. sales-enablement (playbook reps execute)
3. sales-coaching (REKS diagnose — Jacco van der Kooij / WbD)
4. meeting-prep + demo-scripts (SPICED / Barrows skill drills)
5. buyer-indecision (JOLT when late-stage stall — Dixon/McKenna)
6. gtm-leadership (PIP if 30-day coaching plan flat)
```

**Founder-as-coach:** `sales-coaching` (founder-coaching reference) until manager hired.  
**Ramp:** `revenue-team-onboarding` weeks 1–4 → `sales-coaching` call rubric.

### Pattern 12: Bootstrap vs Venture Outcome
```
1. saas-outcomes (end goal, exit-metrics-matrix, bootstrap-vs-vc-paths, bootstrap-founder-playbook)
2. saas-metrics-calculator (metric-definitions-exit-weight)
3. solo-founder-gtm (bootstrap-capital-plan) OR fundraising-strategy (vc-milestone-gates)
4. financial-modeling (unit-economics-exit-bridge)
5. exiting-company (valuation-drivers, buyer-readiness, diligence pack)
```

### Pattern 15: Exit Readiness & Valuation
```
1. saas-outcomes (path + exit-metrics-matrix)
2. saas-metrics-calculator (formulas + benchmarks)
3. financial-modeling (P&L → ARR/EBITDA multiple bridge)
4. exiting-company (scorecard, sensitivity table, diligence pack)
5. equity-management (cap table cleanup)
6. exiting-company (negotiating-earn-out + earn-out-term-sheet-review) if LOI has deferred consideration
```

### Pattern 32: Founder Exit Economics (Earn-Out + Bootstrap Paths)
```
1. saas-outcomes (bootstrap-founder-playbook, bootstrap-vs-vc-paths, exit-potential-scorecard)
2. solo-founder-gtm (when-not-to-scale, spend-by-stage, bootstrap-capital-plan)
3. financial-modeling (unit-economics-exit-bridge, valuation-sensitivity-table)
4. exiting-company (negotiating-earn-out, earn-out-term-sheet-review, buyer-readiness)
5. fundraising-strategy (bootstrap vs raise — vc-milestone-gates)
6. founder-comp-playbook (post-close retention comp if earn-out + employment)
7. references/benchmark-reconciliation.md (bootstrap multiples + earn-out vs upfront)
8. deal-desk/references/legal-gtm-playbook.md (counsel handoff — Pattern 29)
```

**Triggers:** "negotiate earn-out", "earnout term sheet", "bootstrap founder exit",
"MicroAcquire sale", "walk away from LOI", "seller note", "rollover equity",
"retention bonus vs earn-out", "bootstrap capital plan".

1. social-selling (LinkedIn trust + SSI baseline)
2. sales-coaching (Three Plays, relationship map, trust scorecard — Seidl)
3. pipeline-management (MEDDICC evidence per stakeholder thread)
4. multi-thread-orchestration (champion-only anti-pattern)

```

**When to use:** $100K+ ACV, 6+ month cycles, multi-stakeholder enterprise.
**Pair with:** Pattern 14 (Benioff enterprise CRM) · Chris Walker (dark social awareness).

### Pattern 14: Enterprise GTM (Marc Benioff)

3. customer-onboarding (sales-to-CS data handoff, no email re-requests)
4. revops-tech-stack (where data may live in the GTM stack)
5. cold-email-strategy (anti-pattern: customer PII in sequences)
6. soc2-compliance + security-assessments (founder-led — building trust artifacts, not rep hygiene)
```

Load canonical SOP: `references/gtm-data-exchange-playbook.md`. Enterprise
security review timing: `references/security-questionnaire-deal-guide.md`.

### Pattern 9: Stuck Late-Stage Deal (JOLT)
```

4. objection-handling (if price/value pushback, not indecision)
```

### Pattern 3: Data → Decision → Action
```
1. gtm-metrics + event-analytics (collect data)
2. cs-analytics-dashboards + financial-modeling (make decisions)
3. expansion-selling + churn-prevention (take action)
```

### Pattern 4: AI-First GTM (The Vibe Stack)

2. vibe-marketing → Generate campaigns, content, creative
3. ai-content-creation → Scale blog, social, email production
4. ai-video-creation → Produce video without a video team
```

### Pattern 5: WbD Sales Process Build

2. cold-email-copywriting (REPLY messaging, brevity rules)
3. domain-infrastructure + email-deliverability + sending-platforms (scale safely)
4. clay-automation OR signal-scoring (trigger feeds → SEP enrollment)
5. ai-sdr-setup (pilot guardrails: draft-only week 1, human handoff on positive replies)
6. reply-handling (all replies = signs of life; AE triple-touch <90 sec)
7. sales-team-building (TQ ramp in 30 days; ~200 accounts/SDR/month benchmark)
```

**Rule:** Automate only after ICP + messaging proven. Machines think/do; humans feel/engage. RevOps orchestrates bots — see `references/experts.md` → Justin Michael.

### Pattern 15b: Phone-First Cold Calling & Bucketing

```
1. list-building + signal-scoring (Gilkey Phone Intent + Jordan Crawford PQS)
2. cold-calling (primary — references/cold-calling-experts-index.md)
   → joey-gilkey-bucketing.md · ryan-reisert-cold-calling.md
   → ronen-pessar-cold-calling.md · tom-slocum-cold-calling.md
3. pipeline-management (dispositions → pipeline tiers; Reisert buckets → CRM stages)
4. multi-channel-outreach (email/LI complementary touches)
5. sales-team-building + revenue-team-onboarding (pilot before SDR scale; phone ramp)
```

**Two bucketing systems:** Gilkey = outcome dispositions. Reisert = daily CRM priority. Phone experts ≠ email experts — cross-link `cold-email-strategy` for written cadence only.

### Pattern 15c: High-Scale Cold Email Infrastructure (Eric Nowoslawski)

```
1. cold-email-strategy (unit economics gate — eric-nowoslawski-outbound.md)

4. cold-email-copywriting (Creative Ideas / AI Specificity offer-led campaigns)
5. clay-automation (Crawl Walk Run rollout)

5. email-deliverability + sending-platforms (Eric Nowoslawski infra before scale)
6. multi-channel-outreach (channel-native touches — not email paste to LinkedIn)
7. reply-handling (positive reply → immediate call routing)
```

**Rule:** Data quality before copy scale — *"If your outbound isn't converting, it's probably not your copy. It's your data."* Pair with Jordan Crawford (PQS/PVP research) for segment depth; Guillaume (multichannel cadence) or Justin Michael (SEP automation) for scale; Eric Nowoslawski for infra at volume. Expert router → `references/gtm-experts-outbound-index.md`.

### Pattern 6: Clay GTM Stack
```
1. clay-automation (process: when to build, data quality)
2. clay-toolkit — tools/clay-toolkit (table + LeadMagic waterfall)
3. clay-loops-toolkit — tools/clay-loops-toolkit (signal loops)
4. ai-prompts-toolkit (Claygent/LLM prompts P01–P10)
5. leadmagic-toolkit + leadmagic-waterfall (Find → Verify → Enrich columns)
6. `sequencing-toolkit` OR platform sequencer skill OR `crm-toolkit` (output — verify gate before enroll)
7. signal play skill (funding/job-change/hiring message)
```

**Tool vs process:** `tools/clay-*` = column/table config. `automation/clay-automation` = rollout.

### Pattern 6b: n8n Orchestration (Inbound / Outbound / MCP)
```
1. n8n-automation (n8n vs Clay vs MCP decision)
2. n8n-toolkit (pick flow ID: INB/OUT/SIG/LIF/REV/MCP)
3. Motion skill (inbound-triage, reply-handling, signal play)
4. mcp-setup + leadmagic-mcp (if agent triggers MCP-01 webhook)
5. crm-toolkit + proactive-alerts (CRM fields + Slack)
```

Clay enriches; n8n routes at SLA; MCP agents draft/research — never loop
500 API calls in chat; POST approved jobs to n8n.

### Pattern 7: Agency Pilot → In-House
```
1. pipeline-management + gtm-context (document process first)
2. hiring-agencies (evaluate, 90-day pilot, weekly scorecard)
3. cold-email-strategy or clay-automation (channel-specific standards)
4. sales-team-building (graduate to hire when pilot proves ROI)
```

### Pattern 8: Survival → Thrival → Enterprise (Lemkin + Roberge)
```
1. gtm-context + icp-scoring (define who you sell to)
2. founder-sales + meeting-prep (Survival — founder closes, documents the motion)
3. pipeline-management + sales-enablement (Thrival — repeatable process + playbook)
4. sales-team-building + hiring-by-role (Thrival — hire for Roberge traits, train for skills)
5. icp-targeting-tiers + abm-strategy + multi-thread-orchestration (Enterprise — upmarket)
6. roi-calculator + deal-desk + soc2-compliance (Enterprise — economic buyer + procurement)
```

```
1. references/force-management-playbook.md (cadence, reporting, pod worksheet)
2. sales-team-building (POD design, hiring sequence, compensation)
3. gtm-leadership (monthly GTM scorecard, quarterly territory/quota)
4. sales-enablement (Command of the Message talk tracks)
5. pipeline-management + meeting-prep (MEDDICC gates)
6. gtm-metrics + financial-modeling (unit economics ↔ headcount)
```

### Pattern 25: B2B SEO Stack (Schwartz + Fishkin + Ahrefs)
```
1. seo-strategy + references/seo-strategy-playbook.md (keyword tiers, measurement)
2. pillar-pages (hub + cluster architecture)
3. pseo-strategy (programmatic templates — thin-content gates)
4. faq-seo + aeo-strategy (schema + AI search)
5. citation-harvesting (LLM mention tracking)
6. content-marketing + content-syndication (distribution — Walker frequency)
```

### Pattern 26: Demand Creation (Chris Walker)
```
1. references/chris-walker-mental-models.md (dark social, frequency, 90-day eval)
2. content-marketing (ungated education, channel stacking)
3. paid-social-strategy (LinkedIn education, not form-fill)
4. podcast-gtm + content-syndication (dark social amplifiers)
5. attribution + gtm-metrics (cohort revenue, not last-click ROAS)
6. seo-strategy (measurable demand layer)
```

**Contrast Pattern 27:** Walker = unmeasurable dark social. HubSpot inbound = lifecycle + flywheel capture. Run both; reconcile in `references/benchmark-reconciliation.md` (inbound vs demand gen).

### Pattern 27: Inbound Flywheel (Dharmesh Shah / HubSpot)
```
1. references/dharmesh-shah-hubspot-inbound.md (flywheel, attract-engage-delight, freemium entry)
2. content-marketing + seo-strategy (Attract — pillar + cluster)
3. landing-pages + freemium-optimization (permission-based conversion)
4. inbound-triage + mql-nurture (Engage — speed-to-lead, enrichment on form fill)
5. customer-marketing + referral-programs + review-platforms (Delight — advocacy fuels flywheel)
6. expansion-selling + gtm-metrics (NRR as flywheel fuel — Meritech benchmarks for scale narrative)
7. hubspot-setup OR crm-integration (lifecycle stages, CRM config)
```

**Pair with:** Pattern 20 (visitor ID — measurable intent) · Pattern 26 (dark social awareness) · Mark Roberge (sales machine when hiring).
**Contrast:** Chris Walker rejects lead-gen industrial complex; HubSpot inbound still uses MQL→SQL when **fit** is proven — qualify hard, don't optimize form volume alone.

### Pattern 28: HR GTM / People Ops for Revenue Teams (Stacey Nordwall)
```
1. gtm-role-descriptions/references/hr-gtm-playbook.md (canonical — onboarding, manager enablement, remote GTM)
2. gtm-role-descriptions + references/comp-benchmarks.md (Bridge Group bands; Pavilion validate)
3. hiring-by-role (structured interviews — re:Work, Roberge traits)

6. executive-compensation + founder-comp-playbook (VP+ and payroll % ARR)
7. sales-team-building (hire sequence, POD ratios)
8. executive-compensation/references/gtm-compensation-strategy.md (Pattern 35 — full comp design)
```

**Triggers:** "HR for sales team", "People Ops GTM", "revenue comp bands", "SDR ramp HR", "remote sales team onboarding", "Culture Amp onboarding".  
**Pair with:** Pattern 2 (hire → onboard) · Pattern 35 (comp plan design) · `references/benchmark-reconciliation.md` (ramp + comp alignment).  
**Contrast:** Nordwall = employee experience systems; Roberge = ramp metrics; Sam Jacobs = exec comp; Pattern 35 = full IC→CRO strategy.

### Pattern 29: Legal GTM / Commercial Counsel (Eunice Buhler + Ironclad)
```
1. deal-desk/references/legal-gtm-playbook.md (canonical — sales-legal alignment, swimlanes)

3. references/security-questionnaire-deal-guide.md (when security review enters deal)
4. references/gtm-data-exchange-playbook.md (DPA timing, data channels)
5. soc2-compliance + security-assessments (artifact build — founder-led)
6. vendor-contracts (vendor-side MSAs/DPAs)
7. employment-compliance (commission plans, SDR classification — not MSA)
```

**Triggers:** "MSA redlines", "when to sign DPA", "sales legal alignment", "deal desk approvals", "commercial counsel", "Ironclad CLM".  
**Pair with:** Pattern 16 (customer data exchange) — same phase gates, different lens (legal velocity vs data hygiene).  
**Disclaimer:** GTM practitioner guidance — escalate binding terms to counsel.

### Pattern 30: RevOps Automation Maturity (Jen Igartua / Go Nimbly)
```
1. references/gtm-automation-expert-playbook.md (canonical — maturity 0–4, human/machine split)

8. gtm-metrics (pipeline impact — not automation vanity)
```

**Triggers:** "RevOps automation", "GTM workflow design", "automation maturity", "fix Zapier sprawl", "AI agents RevOps", "Go Nimbly".  
**Pair with:** Pattern 6/6b (Clay/n8n build) · Pattern 7 (agency → in-house).  
**Contrast:** Pattern 30 = orchestration strategy. Pattern 23 (Justin Michael) = outbound human+machine. Pattern 15c (Eric) = email infra. Pattern 17 (Pat) = enrichment copy. Do not merge.

### Pattern 31: CRO Enterprise Strategy (John McMahon + Snowflake + Databricks)
```
1. gtm-leadership/references/cro-enterprise-strategy.md (canonical — CRO 90-day, inspection, board metrics)
2. gtm-leadership (hire/fire CRO, difficult conversations, comp approval)
3. sales-team-building (A players, manager-before-rep, hybrid inside/field)
4. pipeline-management (MEDDICC inspection, three-view forecast, Gap Selling anti–happy ears)
5. gtm-metrics + public-company-gtm-metrics.md (5-quarter model, productivity per rep, Meritech)
6. executive-compensation (consumption-aligned CRO gates — Slootman pattern)
7. expansion-selling (Snowflake consumption land-expand, Databricks workload expansion)
8. references/force-management-playbook.md (territory/quota true-up)

```

**Triggers:** "CRO strategy", "John McMahon", "enterprise sales leadership", "Snowflake GTM", "consumption sales comp", "Databricks enterprise", "board forecast CRO", "inspect what you expect", "5-quarter model".  
**Pair with:** Pattern 5/13 (MEDDICC discovery) · Pattern 14 (land-expand) · Pattern 28 (HR ramp) · Meritech/Henry Schuck public metrics.  
**Contrast:** McMahon = CRO systems altitude. Jon Barrows = rep tactical skills. Roberge = early-stage hire/train. Lemkin = when *not* to hire VP.

### Pattern 18: Lifecycle Stages & Activation Monitoring
```
1. references/gtm-lifecycle-stages.md (canonical 7 stages + Bowtie + team ramp)
2. references/activation-playbook.md (first value event, TTA benchmarks, audit)
3. references/lifecycle-metrics-by-stage.md (formulas + R/Y/G thresholds)
4. skills/analytics/gtm-metrics/templates/lifecycle-monitoring-dashboard.md (weekly/monthly cadence)
5. skills/analytics/gtm-metrics/templates/stage-health-scorecard.md (leadership rollup)
6. Stage skills — load by need (see routing table below)
```

**Stage → skill routing (do not duplicate stage defs in skills):**

| Stage | Primary skills | Monitoring artifact |
|---|---|---|
| Awareness | `content-marketing`, `seo-strategy`, `paid-social-strategy`, `customer-marketing`, `social-selling` | `lifecycle-monitoring-dashboard` (Awareness row) · `b2b-influencer-strategy.md` |
| Acquisition | `mql-nurture`, `inbound-triage`, `attribution` | `lifecycle-metrics-by-stage` (Acquisition) |

| Referral | `referral-programs`, `customer-marketing`, `review-platforms` | `stage-health-scorecard` (Referral) |

**Founder journey overlay:** `saas-outcomes/references/journey-stage-gates.md` gates company stage; Pattern 18 gates customer lifecycle health.  
**Revenue team parallel:** `revenue-team-onboarding` (Hire → Ramp → Productivity) — see `gtm-lifecycle-stages.md` team table.  
**Router:** `references/lifecycle-skill-index.md`

### Pattern 19: GTM Project Management & RACI
```
1. gtm-operations (canonical PM home — lightweight vs heavyweight, cadence, milestones)
2. gtm-operations/templates/gtm-project-charter.md + raci-matrix-template.md (one A per row)
3. campaign-governance (if launch — naming/UTM RACI rows; do not duplicate UTM spec)
4. revops-tech-stack (if migration/vendor — Phase 4c + RACI Examples 2/4)
5. gtm-spend-management (if vendor — spend-approval-matrix)
6. gtm-leadership + team-design-gtm-projects (launch pod, DRI span of control)
7. clickup-gtm-workspace OR gtm-organization-principles (SSOT for tasks/docs/data)
8. revenue-team-onboarding (if onboarding cohort project)
```

**Triggers:** "campaign launch project", "CRM migration RACI", "ClickUp for RevOps",
"QBR prep project", "who owns UTM vs CRM", "organize GTM docs".  
**Refs:** [Atlassian RACI](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/raci) · [PMI RACI](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/raci-matrix-responsibility-assignment-7039) · [RevOps Co-op PM webinar](https://www.revopscoop.com/webinar-series/revops-project-management).

**Leader development:** `gtm-leadership` + Pavilion (`startup-communities`) for peer groups.

### Pattern 20: Visitor Identification & Intent Routing
```
1. website-visitor-identification (canonical — person vs business, vendors, privacy)
2. 1p-tagging-pixels (consent before visitor ID scripts; UTM source)
3. icp-scoring (filter before CRM write or sales alert)
4. inbound-triage (company ID → MQL path + speed-to-lead SLAs)
5. cold-email-strategy (person ID → guardrailed trigger branch only)
6. revops-tech-stack + gtm-spend-management (one company ID + one person ID max)
7. campaign-governance (UTM + visitor source attribution)
```

**Privacy:** `website-visitor-identification/references/visitor-id-privacy-gtm.md`
(not legal advice). **Measurable counterpart** to Chris Walker dark social (Pattern 26) —
visitor ID is attributable; dark social is not. Pair Pattern 26 + 20.

### Pattern 21: B2B Influencer & Creator GTM (Aneesh Lal / Wishly Group)
```
1. references/aneesh-wishly-b2b-influencer.md (canonical expert — ICP selection, bundles)

```

**Triggers:** "B2B influencer program", "LinkedIn creator partnership", "Wishly Group",
"creator ROI", "employee advocacy vs influencers".  
**Lifecycle:** Awareness stage → `references/gtm-lifecycle-stages.md`.  
**Pair with:** Pattern 26 (demand creation) · `strategic-gifting` (physical ABM touch) ·
`customer-marketing` → `community-selling-varun.md` (creator flywheel from community).

2. **When to Use** — Trigger phrases that activate this skill
3. **Authoritative Foundations** — Named experts and frameworks cited
4. **Step-by-Step Process** — Numbered phases with concrete outputs
5. **Output Format** — What the deliverable looks like
6. **Quality Checklist** — Verifiable checkboxes before considering it done
7. **Common Pitfalls** — Numbered mistakes with root cause + fix

- **Authority-anchored** — Names specific practitioners and frameworks
- **Executable** — Step-by-step. You can follow it without asking questions
- **Pitfall-aware** — Teaches what goes wrong, not just what goes right
- **Artifact-producing** — Every skill produces something (document, deck, calculator, dashboard)
- **Non-fluff** — No guru nonsense. No AI-generated filler. No "one weird trick."

CI enforces this via `scripts/validate-skills.js` (agentskills.io spec + GTM bar):

| Requirement | Every skill |
|---|---|
| Frontmatter | `name` matches directory; `description` has triggers; `metadata.frameworks` ≥ 3 |
| Authority | `## Authoritative Foundations` with named sources (no decoration filler) |
| Process | Step-by-step, implementation checklist, or workflow section |
| Artifact triad | `references/framework-notes.md`, `templates/output-template.md`, `scripts/check-output.py` |
| Execution Artifacts | SKILL.md lists all three paths above |
| References | Every `` `references/...` `` and `` `skills/...` `` path resolves |

Repair scripts: `npm run fix:authority`, `npm run fix:artifacts`, `npm run sync:artifacts`.
Release gate: `npm run verify`.

## Quality Check

Before delivering, verify:

- [ ] Output matches the user's stated request
- [ ] Named frameworks or sources are reflected in the recommendation
- [ ] The deliverable is specific enough for an agent to execute
- [ ] Any assumptions, risks, or dependencies are explicit
- [ ] No unsupported claims, invented facts, or private/internal references are included

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Generic output.** The agent produces advice that could apply to any company. Fix: tie the work to the user's ICP, motion, stage, and constraints.
2. **Missing operating detail.** The answer explains what matters but not what to do. Fix: include concrete steps, templates, fields, or decision rules.
3. **No verification step.** The workflow ends before checking quality. Fix: include a checklist or acceptance criteria.

## Execution Artifacts

- `references/framework-notes.md` — Named frameworks and reference tables
- `templates/output-template.md` — Deliverable shell for agent output
- `scripts/check-output.py` — Lightweight deliverable validator
- `references/gtm-experts-outbound-index.md` — Outbound + discovery expert router (email + phone stacks)
- `references/cold-calling-experts-index.md` — Phone-first expert router (Gilkey, Reisert, Pessar, Slocum)
- `references/experts.md` — Full expert bios and subsidiary maps
- `references/pitfalls-index.md` — Repo-wide `## Common Pitfalls` aggregator (generated; see `scripts/generate-pitfalls-index.js`)
