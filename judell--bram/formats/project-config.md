# Bram

You are running in the terminal of a Tauri desktop shell that puts a real terminal next to an XMLUI surface. The user can see the target app while talking to you, so use it.

## Target app

When the user asks for something that benefits from structured output or structured input, edit `Main.xmlui` or files under `components/` so the target app renders it. A filesystem watcher reloads the iframe automatically when you save, so you do not need to ask the user to refresh.

Examples:

- Show tables, lists, charts, or other structured results in the target app.
- Use selectors, forms, step flows, or other structured input when the user needs to choose or confirm something.
- Prefer XMLUI-native interaction patterns instead of pushing everything through chat.

## Working In XMLUI Surfaces

Both panes here are XMLUI, and most edits land in `.xmlui` files.

- Avoid raw browser JS in event handlers.
- Prefer XMLUI-native abstractions such as `delay`, `debounce`, `Timer`, `DataSource`, and `ChangeListener`.
- Read `app/__shell/conventions.md` for the authoritative Bram-specific workflow, including the worklist lifecycle and approval flow.
- When editing Bram itself (this repo), also read `docs/developing-bram.md` — code organization (helpers.js / Globals.xs / window), the xs-engine failure modes, the post-edit error grep, push-over-polling, and the build vs. hot-reload boundary.
- When a markup choice is non-obvious, cite the XMLUI docs URL for the component or howto you are using.

## Worklist Coordination

`resources/worklist.json` is the canonical surface for coordinating multi-step work between you and the user. Use it whenever you would otherwise enumerate a small set of independently approvable changes in prose.

The full proposed -> applied -> committed flow, authorization payloads, mutate/resolve behavior, and edge cases live in `app/__shell/conventions.md`. Do not duplicate that whole policy here; treat it as the source of truth.

## Files You Will Edit Most

- `Main.xmlui` - the main XMLUI surface.
- `components/*.xmlui` - workspace panels and supporting UI.
- `config.json` - XMLUI app configuration.
- `resources/*.svg` - custom icons registered in `config.json`.
- `app/__shell/helpers.js` - window helpers loaded by `index.html`.

## Files To Leave Alone Unless Asked

- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Rust backend.
- `app/main.js` and `app/index.html` - parent shell wiring.
- `app/vendor/*` - vendored libraries.

## Inspector And Debugging

The target app mounts an Inspector in the AppHeader profile menu slot. Use it when you are debugging interactions before assuming the markup is wrong.

When a UI issue needs deeper inspection, ask the user to reproduce it with the Inspector open and export a trace, then analyze the trace instead of guessing from the markup.

## Architectural Background

The deeper background for Bram's shell architecture, runtime behavior, and gotchas lives in `~/.agents/scout/projects/claude-code-desktop.md`. Read it if a mechanism here surprises you.

<!-- bram:start -->
This repo is driven through Bram. The canonical worklist gate is carried by codex's `developer_instructions` (top-level in `~/.codex/config.toml`, installed by Bram Setup) and enforced at runtime by a `PreToolUse` hook installed under `~/.bram`. Read `app/__shell/conventions.md` for the full conventions, including opt-out phrases, the two-stage proposed → applied → committed flow, approval payload shape, loopback lifecycle calls, and edge cases.

Quick summary so you can act in this turn:

- First response to a change request must be **(a)** a clarifying question, **(b)** a write to `resources/worklist.json` proposing items (each with non-empty `id`, `file` or `files`, `before`, and `after`), or **(c)** read-only investigation explicitly prefaced *"I don't yet have enough context to propose; I need to check X first"* — and the very next action after that check must be a worklist write, not narration of a plan.
- Mutations (`apply_patch`, `Bash`, `mcp__filesystem__write/edit/create/move`, etc.) on paths not covered by a proposed/applied worklist item are blocked at runtime. Following the convention avoids hitting that wall.
- Approval is structured only: `approved: {"items":[...]}` for applying, a second `approved:` to authorize commit. Don't infer authorization from free-text replies.
