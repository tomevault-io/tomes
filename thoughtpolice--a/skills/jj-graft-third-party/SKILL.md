# Jj Graft Third Party

## Overview

Integrate third-party repository history into the monorepo by adding git remotes and creating workspaces that point to upstream branches. This connects external repository history to the main repo through jj's virtual `root()` commit, enabling local modifications and patch testing while maintaining the relationship with upstream.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Testing patches to upstream projects before submitting them
- Making local modifications to third-party code that need to be tracked
- Maintaining a fork of a dependency with upstream tracking
- Developing features that require changes to both the monorepo and a dependency
- Experimenting with modifications to third-party libraries

**Do not use when:** Simply examining source code without modifications (use `jj-clone-third-party` instead).

## Workflow

### 1. Add the Remote Repository

Add a git remote for the upstream repository:

```bash
jj git remote add <remote-name> <repository-url>
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Add tokio as a remote
jj git remote add tokio https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio

# Add serde as a remote
jj git remote add serde https://github.com/serde-rs/serde

# Add custom library
jj git remote add mylib https://github.com/someorg/mylib
```

**Best practice:** Use descriptive remote names that match the project name for clarity.

### 2. Fetch from the Remote

Fetch the remote repository's history:

```bash
jj git fetch --remote=<remote-name>
```

**Examples:**
```bash
jj git fetch --remote=tokio
jj git fetch --remote=serde
```

This imports the remote's git history into the jj repository. The history becomes accessible but doesn't affect working copies yet.

### 3. Create a Workspace Pointing to the Remote Branch

Create a workspace in `work/` that points to the remote's main branch:

```bash
jj workspace add \
  --name=<workspace-name> \
  -r <branch>@<remote-name> \
  work/<directory-name>
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Create workspace for tokio's main branch
jj workspace add \
  --name=tokio \
  -r main@tokio \
  work/tokio

# Create workspace for serde's master branch
jj workspace add \
  --name=serde \
  -r master@serde \
  work/serde

# Create workspace for a specific tag or commit
jj workspace add \
  --name=mylib-v2 \
  -r v2.0.0@mylib \
  work/mylib
```

**Important:** The branch name must match what the upstream repository uses (commonly `main`, `master`, or `trunk`). Use `jj git fetch --remote=<name>` output to see available branches.

### 4. Work in the Workspace

Navigate to the workspace and make changes:

```bash
cd work/<directory-name>

# Make modifications to the code
# Test changes
# Create commits as normal with jj

# View the integrated history
jj log
```

The workspace is a full working copy with the third-party history connected to the main repository. Changes made here create new commits on top of the upstream history.

### 5. Sync with Upstream (Optional)

Update the workspace with latest upstream changes:

```bash
# Fetch latest changes from remote
jj git fetch --remote=<remote-name>

# From within the workspace, rebase onto latest upstream
cd work/<directory-name>
jj rebase -d <branch>@<remote-name>
```

### 6. Clean Up When Done

When finished with the workspace:

```bash
# Forget the workspace (keeps commits in the main repo)
jj workspace forget <workspace-name>

# Remove the directory
rm -rf work/<directory-name>

# Optionally remove the remote if no longer needed
jj git remote remove <remote-name>
```

**Important:** `jj workspace forget` removes the workspace reference but preserves all commits. The commits remain in the repository's history and can be accessed via `jj log`.

## Advanced Patterns

### Testing Patches Before Upstream Submission

1. Create grafted workspace pointing to upstream
2. Make changes and test thoroughly in the workspace
3. Generate patch files or create a branch for submission:
   ```bash
   cd work/<directory-name>
   jj git export  # Export to git format if needed
   ```

### Maintaining a Long-Term Fork

1. Graft the upstream repository
2. Create a named branch for local modifications:
   ```bash
   cd work/<directory-name>
   jj branch create <fork-branch-name>
   ```
3. Periodically sync with upstream and rebase local changes

### Comparing Local Changes to Upstream

View differences between local modifications and upstream:

```bash
cd work/<directory-name>
jj diff -r <branch>@<remote-name>
```

## Best Practices

### Remote Naming

Use descriptive remote names matching the project:
- `tokio` for tokio-rs/tokio
- `serde` for serde-rs/serde
- `buck2` for facebook/buck2

### Workspace Naming

Match workspace names to remote names for consistency:
```bash
jj workspace add --name=tokio -r main@tokio work/tokio
```

### Branch Discovery

Check available branches after fetching:
```bash
jj git fetch --remote=<remote-name>
# Look for "remote: <remote-name>/branch-name" in output
```

Common branch names: `main`, `master`, `trunk`, `develop`

### Commit Organization

Keep local modifications in separate, well-documented commits on top of upstream to make patch generation easier.

## Troubleshooting

See `references/troubleshooting.md` for common issues and solutions.

## Limitations

- **Requires network access:** Fetching from remotes requires internet connectivity
- **Workspace management overhead:** Must track workspace lifecycle and cleanup
- **Potential merge conflicts:** Syncing with upstream may require conflict resolution
- **Storage overhead:** Fetching large repositories adds to repository size
