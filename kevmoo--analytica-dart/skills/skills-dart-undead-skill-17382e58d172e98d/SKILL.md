# Dart Undead (`dart-undead`)

Deterministic reachability and dead/unused declaration analysis for Dart and
Flutter packages using `pkg:undead`.

---

## 1. When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when auditing codebase health, trimming dead weight from mature
packages, identifying orphaned internal abstractions, or cleaning up standalone
applications and CLI tools.

Unlike basic lexical lints (`unused_element`, `unused_field`) which only detect
unused file-private (`_`) identifiers, `undead` builds a whole-package
reachability graph from designated entrypoint roots down to all internal
declarations.

### Trigger Indicators

- **Orphaned Internal Utilities**: Functions, classes, or mixins under
  `lib/src/` unreachable from public API barrels or internal entrypoints.
- **Dead Application Features**: Unreachable views, controllers, or services in
  standalone CLI tools or Flutter apps.
- **Orphaned Test Fixtures**: Dead `Fake*` or `Mock*` fixtures left behind after
  features were refactored.
- **Pre-Release API Pruning**: Verifying whether newly introduced experimental
  helpers are actually wired up before public release.

### When NOT to Use

- **Single-File Private Lints**: Rely on standard `dart analyze` for simple
  local variable or private parameter lints.
- **Code Formatting or Lint Rules**: Use standard `dart format` or `dart fix`.
- **Non-Dart / Non-Flutter Projects**: Tool exclusively operates on Dart ASTs.

---

## 2. Automated Execution & Scope Resolution

Execute the official package CLI directly in the terminal to retrieve
reachability findings deterministically:

```bash
dart run undead@^0.1.1 [options] [target_path]
```

> [!NOTE] **Pre-Flight Package Resolution Gate**: `package:analyzer` requires
> `.dart_tool/package_config.json` to resolve `package:<name>/...` imports. If
> packages are unresolved, pass `--pub-get` to automatically run `dart pub get`
> or `flutter pub get`. If encountering `.dart_tool` atomic rename errors in
> sandboxed environments, pass `--no-precompile` (e.g.
> `dart run --no-precompile undead@^0.1.1`).

### Execution Modes

#### Mode 1: Library Package (Default / Open-World)

Preserves all non-`src` `lib/**` exports as public API roots. Analyzes whether
internal declarations (`lib/src/**`) are reachable from exported barrels or
tests:

```bash
# Markdown output for human review
dart run undead@^0.1.1

# Machine-readable JSON output for agent automation
dart run undead@^0.1.1 --format=json
```

#### Mode 2: Closed Application (`--mode=closed-app`)

Traces execution strictly from executable entrypoints (`bin/**`,
`lib/main.dart`, `lib/main_*.dart`). Treats unreferenced public declarations as
dead:

```bash
dart run undead@^0.1.1 --mode=closed-app
```

#### Mode 3: Example Code Handling (`--example-mode`)

Controls how code in `example/` is treated during reachability analysis:

- `demonstration` (Default): `example/` code is treated as a consumer root;
  example files are never suggested for deletion.
- `strict`: Analyzes reachability within `example/` itself.
- `skip`: Ignores `example/` completely during analysis.

```bash
dart run undead@^0.1.1 --example-mode=demonstration
```

## 3. Critical Safety Guardrails & Deletion Invariants

> [!CAUTION] **Audit Before Deleting**: Never delete declarations autonomously
> without reviewing safety invariants and verifying against the test suite.

### Invariant 1: Sealed Class Hierarchy Protection

Direct subtypes of live `sealed` classes (via `extends`, `implements`, `with`,
or `enum`) must **NEVER** be deleted, even if unreferenced elsewhere. Deleting a
sealed subtype breaks Dart 3 exhaustive pattern matching across all `switch`
expressions.

### Invariant 2: Co-Invoked Test Hazard Protection

When a test file invokes both live and dead declarations:

- **Isolated Dead Tests**: Test blocks referencing _only_ dead code can be
  safely pruned alongside the dead target.
- **Co-Invoked Test Hazard**: When a single test function or widget test
  exercises both live and dead code, **do not delete the test**. Refactor the
  test body to remove only the dead assertions.

### Invariant 3: Framework Entrypoints & Pragmas

Ensure framework-specific roots are not falsely classified as dead:

- **Build Runner**: Builder factories and generator entrypoints in `build.yaml`.
- **VM Entrypoints**: Declarations annotated with `@pragma('vm:entry-point')`.
- **JS Interop**: External JavaScript facades (`@JS()`). Pass
  `--ignore-external-bindings` if pruning libraries with public interop headers.

### Invariant 4: Custom Suppression Syntax

To suppress intentional dead code or API placeholders without deleting:

- **Declaration Level**: `// undead:ignore` (placed directly above declaration).
- **File Level**: `// undead:ignore_for_file` (placed at top of file).
- _(Note: The standard `// ignore: unreachable_from_main` is strictly for the
  built-in Dart analyzer lint rule; `pkg:undead` requires `// undead:ignore`)._

### Invariant 5: Dynamic Invocation & Non-AST Reference Check

Static AST analysis (`pkg:undead`) only traces typed Dart import trees. It
cannot see declarations referenced through runtime meta-programming:

- Dynamic isolate spawners (`dart.runInIsolate`, `Isolate.spawnUri`)
- Code-generation string templates (`'''import "package:.../foo.dart";'''`)
- JS / WASM compilation targets and runtime asset bootstrap runners
- Build hooks and `build.yaml` references

**The Pre-Deletion Check Protocol:**

1. Before deleting any candidate file or top-level declaration in `lib/src/`,
   perform a literal string search (`grep_search "<filename_or_symbol>"`) across
   the repository.
2. If text matches exist outside the target file itself, **inspect and
   understand the match context** before deleting:
   - **KEEP**: The match is an active runtime string template, dynamic isolate
     entrypoint, or compilation target. Protect it with `// undead:ignore`.
   - **PRUNE**: The match is merely a doc comment, obsolete README reference, or
     dead test fixture that should be deleted alongside the target.

### Invariant 6: Monorepo & External Entrypoint Protection

In multi-package workspaces where internal implementation libraries export
entrypoints consumed by sibling CLI wrappers or test runners:

- Include sibling packages and root integration test folders using
  `--extra-roots` or enable `--workspace-discovery`.
- If an unexported function is an intended external entrypoint, protect it with
  `// undead:ignore` (and `// ignore: unreachable_from_main` if analyzer lint is
  active).

### Invariant 7: Cohesive Subsystem Pruning

When pruning dead code, avoid partial or purely cosmetic deletions that leave
larger unreferenced subsystems intact:

- Delete all verified unreferenced internal classes, functions, and files in
  `lib/src/` (e.g., unreferenced listener classes, unused event sinks, obsolete
  scaffold runners) in one cohesive pass.
- Remove orphaned imports, associated dead private helpers, and obsolete test
  fixtures concurrently.

## 4. The 2-Stage Triage & Confirmation Protocol

To prevent accidental deletions of public APIs or breaking downstream consumers,
follow this strict 2-stage workflow:

### Stage 1: Read-Only Audit & Reporting (Mandatory Stop)

Run `dart run undead@^0.1.1 --format=markdown` (or `--format=json`).

**Mandatory Persistent Artifact**: You MUST create a structured Markdown
artifact named `undead_triage_report.md` in
`<appDataDir>/brain/<conversation-id>/`. The artifact must include:

1. **Target Summary**: Package name, analysis mode (`library` vs `closed-app`),
   and total undead declarations detected.
2. **Actionable Findings Table**: Clickable file link, line number, declaration
   type (`class`, `function`, `method`, `variable`), and name. Must include code
   snippets.
3. **Safety Annotations**: Highlight any `sealed` subtypes, co-invoked test
   hazards, or public exports.

**Visible Chat Pre-Render**: You MUST render a high-level summary and a direct
clickable link to the triage report artifact in visible chat BEFORE invoking the
confirmation gate.

### Stage 2: Interactive User Confirmation Gate

**Anti-Blind-Modal Invariant**: Strictly FORBID calling `ask_question` in the
same step as an unrendered report without the report already existing on disk
and in chat. The question prompt in `ask_question` should explicitly reference
the generated triage artifact (e.g., "Based on the findings in
[undead_triage_report.md](...)...").

Pause execution and prompt the user (via interactive choice or chat) to select
the desired remediation scope:

1. **(Recommended) Prune All Verified Dead Subsystems & Files**: Concurrently
   delete all unreferenced internal classes, functions, and files in
   `lib/src/**` and isolated dead test files.
2. **Prune Application Entrypoints**: Target dead features in a closed app
   (`--mode=closed-app`).
3. **Suppress Findings**: Add `// undead:ignore` comments to intentional
   placeholders.
4. **Report-Only / Exit**: Acknowledge findings without code mutations.

> **Explicit Bypass & Non-Interactive Fallback**:
>
> - **Direct Directives**: Skip Stage 1 pause if given explicit remediation
>   instructions (e.g., "Prune dead code in `pkgs/foo` using `dart-undead`").
> - **Non-Interactive Execution**: In unattended or automated evaluation
>   workflows (e.g. `evalin` or subagents), proceed with Option 1 (Prune All
>   Verified Dead Subsystems) automatically after verifying baseline tests pass.

---

## 5. Pre & Post Deletion Verification Protocol

Always wrap code deletions in a strict test and analysis sandwich:

1. **Pre-Flight Baseline**:
   - Check `pubspec.yaml`: if `sdk: flutter` is declared, run `flutter test`;
     otherwise run `dart test`.
   - Confirm test suite is 100% green before touching code.
2. **Surgical Deletion**: Remove the flagged declaration and any orphaned
   imports associated with it.
3. **Post-Flight Verification**:
   - Run `flutter analyze` or `dart analyze` to ensure zero compilation or
     unresolved reference errors.
   - Run `flutter test` or `dart test` to confirm all remaining tests pass.
   - **Monorepo Downstream Gate**: In multi-package repositories, run tests
     across all dependent workspace packages and root integration tests before
     staging.
   - **Repository Policies**: If the repository enforces changelog tracking,
     update `CHANGELOG.md` alongside the change.
4. **Clean Diff Staging**: Inspect modifications using `git diff --stat` to
   ensure only intended declarations were removed.

---

## 6. Pull Request & Commit Provenance Protocol

When staging pruned code and preparing a commit message or Pull Request:

### 1. User Confirmation Gate

- **Interactive Sessions**: Before writing the PR description or commit body,
  explicitly prompt the user in chat or via the harness confirmation tool (e.g.
  `ask_question`) whether to include a **Tool Provenance & Reproduction block**.
- **User Prompt Inclusion**: When the user explicitly requests inclusion (or
  confirms via prompt), append the standardized markdown block below. In
  unattended or automated workflows, output the summary to chat or step
  summaries rather than modifying commit bodies without user confirmation.

### 2. Standardized Provenance Block Format

When confirmed by the user, include the following markdown block in the PR
description or commit body so reviewers understand where the deletions
originated and can rerun the reachability analysis locally:

````markdown
### 🤖 Tool Provenance & Reproduction

Dead code detection and reachability analysis performed with
[`undead`](https://pub.dev/packages/undead) (`v{version}`).

To reproduce or re-run this reachability audit locally:

```bash
{exact_command_line}
```
````

### 3. Version Resolution

Determine the package version dynamically:

- Check `pubspec.lock` in the workspace or run
  `dart run undead@^0.1.1 --version`.
- If invoked with a specific version constraint (e.g. `undead@^0.1.1`), use that
  exact version.
