# Dart Dedupe (`dart-dedupe`)

High-performance structural code duplication and clone detection engine and
refactoring protocol for Dart and Flutter repositories using `pkg:dedupe`.

---

## 1. When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when auditing codebase redundancy, identifying copy-paste blocks,
preventing duplication regressions in pull requests, or evaluating shared
utility and abstraction candidates across Dart packages.

Unlike basic lexical diffs, `dedupe` tokenizes and analyzes Dart source code to
detect:

- **Identical Clones**: Exact token-for-token copies across files.
- **Structural Clones**: Clones matching after normalizing string literals and
  numeric constants (`--ignore-literals`).
- **Parameterized Clones**: Clones matching after normalizing variable and type
  identifiers (`--ignore-identifiers`).
- **Gapped / Near-Miss Clones**: Type-3 clones matching with internal statement
  insertions, deletions, or edits via MinHash & LSH shingling
  (`--bucket=gapped`).

### Trigger Indicators

- **Copy-pasted utilities**: Identical or nearly identical helper functions
  duplicated across multiple files or classes.
- **Redundant serialization / parsing**: Repeated manual JSON decoders, record
  mappers, or data transformation pipelines.
- **PR / CL Duplication Regressions**: Catching newly introduced duplicate code
  before merging pull requests.

### When NOT to Use

- **Single-File Private Variable Lints**: Use standard `dart analyze` for simple
  unused variables or parameters.
- **Code Formatting**: Use `dart format`.
- **Non-Dart Projects**: Tool operates strictly on Dart syntax.

## 2. Automated Execution & Scope Resolution

Run the official package CLI directly:

```bash
dart run dedupe@^0.1.0 [options] [target_path]
```

### Execution Modes

#### Mode 1: Full Repository / Directory Scan

```bash
# Markdown summary with clickable file links
dart run dedupe@^0.1.0

# Machine-readable JSON output for agent pipelines
dart run dedupe@^0.1.0 --format=json

# Write JSON report to file alongside human stdout
dart run dedupe@^0.1.0 --json-output=report.json
```

#### Mode 2: PR / Git Diff Delta Scan (`--git-diff`)

Focus strictly on code modified in a branch or PR:

```bash
# In Git checkouts:
dart run dedupe@^0.1.0 --git-diff=origin/main

# Filter report strictly to clusters intersecting modified lines:
dart run dedupe@^0.1.0 --git-diff=origin/main --only-changed

# Fail CI if diff duplication exceeds 5%:
dart run dedupe@^0.1.0 --git-diff=origin/main --fail-threshold=5
```

## 3. The "Actionable vs. Necessary" Architectural Gate

**Do not treat every duplicate finding as a mandatory refactoring target.**
Evaluate each candidate cluster before modifying code:

### ✅ Actionable Duplication (Refactor & Extract)

- **Copy-pasted helpers or decoders:** Identical algorithms, database record
  parsers, or conversion utilities scattered across multiple classes or files.
- **Shared contract declarations:** Common `typedef` contracts, data models, or
  record shapes duplicated across platform stubs (extract to a shared library).
- **Repetitive CLI orchestration:** Copy-pasted external process invocations or
  JSON decoding blocks where schema updates would risk drift.
- **Code generator scaffolding:** Repetitive string builders or verbose AST
  instantiations that can be cleanly condensed into parameterized emitters.

### 🛑 Necessary Duplication (Reject Refactoring & Preserve)

- **Type-unsafe polymorphic AST targets:** When similar-looking classes (such as
  AST statement variants) do not share a common type interface. Using `dynamic`
  sacrifices compile-time type safety for negligible line reduction.
- **Performance-critical specialized solver loops:** Symmetric horizontal vs.
  vertical grid traversals where unifying orthogonal strides into a single
  abstraction would require allocating closures or virtual calls in tight loops.
- **Speculative wrapping of standalone entry points:** Abstracting trivial
  4-to-6 line `try/catch` fallback formatting across unrelated standalone CLI
  entry points (`bin/<script>.dart`).
- **Code generator template strings:** Repetitive structural patterns in
  multiline source code generation templates (e.g. `build_runner` code
  emitters).
- **DAMP Test Boilerplate:** Repetitive setup structures in table-driven unit
  tests.

### Invariant: Exhaustive Cluster Adoption

When extracting a shared helper, mixin, or base class for an actionable
duplicate cluster:

- **Mandatory Full-Cluster Scope**: Within a target package or subsystem, you
  MUST apply the shared abstraction across **ALL participating files** in that
  cluster in the same refactoring pass. Do not refactor only 1 file while
  leaving the remaining N - 1 files with duplicate logic.
- **Subsystem Consolidation**: If multiple sibling classes share multiple
  duplicate clusters (e.g. description formatting, error handling, or stream
  lifecycle), design a unified shared base class or mixin consolidating all
  shared clusters at once.
- **Encapsulation & Directory Placement**: Place extracted internal shared
  abstractions under `lib/src/` (e.g. `lib/src/shared/` or `lib/src/common/`).
  Never place internal helpers directly in the public `lib/` root.

---

## 4. The 2-Stage Triage & Confirmation Protocol

To prevent unwanted diff bloat and preserve codebase stability, adhere to this
strict 2-stage workflow:

### Stage 1: Read-Only Audit & Reporting (Mandatory Stop)

Run `dart run dedupe@^0.1.0 --format=markdown` (or `--format=json`).

**Mandatory Persistent Artifact**: You MUST create a structured Markdown
artifact named `dedupe_triage_report.md` in
`<appDataDir>/brain/<conversation-id>/`. The artifact must include:

1. **Target Summary**: Files analyzed, total lines, duplication percentage, and
   estimated lines saved.
2. **Top Duplicate Clusters**: Clickable file links, line ranges, token counts,
   clone classification category (`logic`, `data`, `boilerplate`), and bucket
   (`identical`, `structural`, `parameterized`, `gapped`). Must include code
   snippets.
3. **Actionability Annotations**: Highlight recommended extraction strategy or
   mark as "Necessary Duplication (Preserve)".
4. **Prioritization**: Rank by highest token volume and widest file footprint
   first.

**Visible Chat Pre-Render**: You MUST render a high-level summary and a direct
clickable link to the triage report artifact in visible chat BEFORE invoking the
confirmation gate.

### Stage 2: Interactive User Confirmation Gate

**Anti-Blind-Modal Invariant**: Strictly FORBID calling `ask_question` in the
same step as an unrendered report without the report already existing on disk
and in chat. The question prompt in `ask_question` should explicitly reference
the generated triage artifact (e.g., "Based on the findings in
[dedupe_triage_report.md](...)...").

Pause execution and prompt the user (via interactive choice or chat) to select
the desired remediation scope:

1. **(Recommended) Refactor Top Actionable Cluster Across All Files**:
   Consolidate the highest-impact duplicate cluster and refactor 100% of the
   participating files in that cluster.
2. **Subsystem Base Refactor**: Consolidate multiple related duplicate clusters
   across sibling classes into a unified shared base/mixin.
3. **Report-Only / Exit**: Acknowledge findings without code mutations.

> **Explicit Bypass & Non-Interactive Fallback**:
>
> - **Direct Directives**: Skip Stage 1 pause if given explicit remediation
>   instructions (e.g., "Deduplicate clusters in `pkgs/foo` using
>   `dart-dedupe`").
> - **Non-Interactive Execution**: In unattended or automated evaluation
>   workflows (e.g. `evalin` or subagents), proceed with Option 1 (Refactor Top
>   Actionable Cluster Across All Files) automatically after verifying baseline
>   tests pass.

## 5. Pre & Post Refactor Verification Protocol

Wrap all deduplication refactoring in a strict verification sandwich:

1. **Pre-Flight Baseline**:
   - Check `pubspec.yaml`: if `sdk: flutter` is declared, run `flutter test`;
     otherwise run `dart test`.
   - Confirm test suite is 100% green before touching code.
2. **Surgical Modification**: Extract shared functions or helper classes under
   `lib/src/` cleanly.
3. **Verify Post-Refactor Health**:
   - Run `flutter analyze` or `dart analyze --fatal-infos`.
   - Run `flutter test` or `dart test`.
   - **Monorepo Downstream Gate**: In multi-package workspaces, run tests across
     all dependent packages.
4. **Zero-Clone Confirmation**: Re-run `dart run dedupe@^0.1.0` to confirm the
   target cluster was eliminated.
5. **Local Staging**: Stage verified diffs locally (`git add .`).

---

## 6. Pull Request & Commit Provenance Protocol

When staging deduplicated code and preparing a commit message or Pull Request:

### 1. User Confirmation Gate

- **Interactive Sessions**: Before writing the PR description or commit body,
  explicitly prompt the user in chat or via the harness confirmation tool (e.g.
  `ask_question`) whether to include a **Tool Provenance & Reproduction block**.
- **User Prompt Inclusion**: When the user explicitly requests inclusion (or
  confirms via prompt), append the standardized markdown block below. In
  unattended or automated workflows, output the summary to chat or step
  summaries rather than modifying commit bodies without user confirmation.

### 2. Standardized Provenance Block Format

When confirmed by the user, include the following markdown block in the PR
description or commit body:

````markdown
### 🤖 Tool Provenance & Reproduction

Structural duplication analysis performed with
[`dedupe`](https://pub.dev/packages/dedupe) (`v{version}`).

To reproduce or re-run this duplication scan locally:

```bash
{exact_command_line}
```
````

### 3. Version Resolution

Determine the package version dynamically:

- Check `pubspec.lock` in the workspace or run
  `dart run dedupe@^0.1.0 --version`.
- If invoked with a specific version constraint (e.g. `dedupe@^0.1.0`), use that
  exact version.
