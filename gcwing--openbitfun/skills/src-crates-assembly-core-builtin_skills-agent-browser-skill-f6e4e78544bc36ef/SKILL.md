name: agent-browser
description: Browser automation CLI for AI agents. Use when the user needs to interact with websites, including navigating pages, filling forms, clicking buttons, taking screenshots, extracting data, testing web apps, or automating any browser task. Triggers include requests to "open a website", "fill out a form", "click a button", "take a screenshot", "scrape data from a page", "test this web app", "login to a site", "automate browser actions", or any task requiring programmatic web interaction. Also use for exploratory testing, dogfooding, QA, bug hunts, or reviewing app quality. Also use for automating Electron desktop apps (VS Code, Slack, Discord, Notion, Spotify), checking Slack unreads, sending Slack messages, searching Slack conversations, running browser automation in Vercel Sandbox microVMs, or using AWS Bedrock AgentCore cloud browsers. Prefer OpenBitFun's ControlHub browser domain for web automation when it is available; use agent-browser only when ControlHub is unavailable or for supported Electron automation, and use OpenBitFun ComputerUse for native desktop UI that agent-browser cannot reach. Use when this capability is needed.

# agent-browser

Fast browser automation CLI for AI agents. Chrome/Chromium via CDP with accessibility-tree snapshots and compact `@eN` element refs.

`ControlHub`'s browser domain is OpenBitFun's default path for ordinary web pages, so this skill is opt-in and you are reading it because it was invoked explicitly — proceed with agent-browser for this task. It is the right tool for Electron desktop apps, Slack workspace automation, and cloud browsers, which `ControlHub` does not cover. The two stacks use separate browser instances, element refs, and login state, so do not mix them within one task.

Install only after user approval: `npm i -g agent-browser@0.32.3 && agent-browser install`

If the CLI is unavailable and the user declines installation, explain the missing prerequisite and offer a non-browser fallback; do not silently switch tools.

## Start here

This file is a discovery stub, not the usage guide. Before running any `agent-browser` command, load the actual workflow content from the CLI:

```bash
agent-browser skills get core             # start here — workflows, common patterns, troubleshooting
agent-browser skills get core --full      # include full command reference and templates
```

The CLI serves skill content that always matches the installed version, so instructions never go stale. The content in this stub cannot change between releases, which is why it just points at `skills get core`.

## Specialized skills

Load a specialized skill when the task falls outside browser web pages:

```bash
agent-browser skills get electron          # Electron desktop apps (VS Code, Slack, Discord, ...)
agent-browser skills get slack             # Slack workspace automation
agent-browser skills get dogfood           # Exploratory testing / QA / bug hunts
agent-browser skills get derive-client     # Record a HAR, derive a standalone API client for a site
agent-browser skills get vercel-sandbox    # agent-browser inside Vercel Sandbox microVMs
agent-browser skills get agentcore         # AWS Bedrock AgentCore cloud browsers
```

Run `agent-browser skills list` to see everything available on the installed version.

## Why agent-browser

- Fast native Rust CLI, not a Node.js wrapper
- Works with any AI agent (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Continue, Windsurf, etc.)
- Chrome/Chromium via CDP with no Playwright or Puppeteer dependency
- Accessibility-tree snapshots with element refs for reliable interaction
- Sessions, authentication vault, state persistence, video recording
- Specialized skills for Electron apps, Slack, exploratory testing, cloud providers

## Observability Dashboard

The dashboard runs independently of browser sessions on port 4848 and can also be opened through a proxied or forwarded URL such as `https://dashboard.agent-browser.localhost`. Agents should stay on the dashboard origin: session tabs, status, and stream traffic are proxied internally, so session ports do not need to be exposed.
