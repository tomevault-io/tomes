# Address PR Feedback

Systematically address unresolved review feedback on a pull request.

## Input

Primary input: the PR number or URL.

Optional last parameter: `-- <additional context>`

Interpret `$ARGUMENTS` as one of:
- `<pr-number>`
- `<pr-url>`
- `<pr-number> -- <additional context>`
- `<pr-url> -- <additional context>`
- `-- <additional context>`

If no PR input is provided, detect it from the current branch: `gh pr view --json number`.
Use any additional context to prioritize reviewer concerns, constraints, or follow-up expectations.

## Process

### Step 1: Fetch Unresolved Threads

**Use GraphQL** — the REST API does NOT expose `isResolved` status on review threads.

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query {
  repository(owner: "<OWNER>", name: "<REPO>") {
    pullRequest(number: <PR_NUMBER>) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          isResolved
          isOutdated
          path
          line
          id
          comments(first: 10) {
            nodes {
              id
              body
              author { login }
              url
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

Filter for unresolved threads: `select(.isResolved == false)`.

### Step 2: Process Each Thread

For each unresolved thread, read the file and surrounding context, then categorize. Incorporate any optional additional context when choosing how to respond:
- **Actionable** — code change needed
- **Question** — respond with explanation
- **Discussion** — assess if change improves code
- **Already addressed** — change was made but thread not resolved
- **Won't fix** — explain why current approach is preferred
- **Follow-up** — valid improvement, out of scope — create linked issue

### Step 3: Address and Reply Individually

**Address each thread immediately, then reply before moving to the next.** Do not batch.

For each thread:

1. **Make the change** (if actionable)
2. **Run lint/format/checks**
3. **Commit**: `git commit -m "fix: address PR feedback — <brief description>"`
4. **Reply to the thread**:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input: {
    pullRequestReviewThreadId: "<THREAD_ID>"
    body: "<response>"
  }) {
    comment { id }
  }
}'
```

Reply format by category:
- **Actionable**: "Fixed in `<sha>`. <what changed>"
- **Question**: "<answer with code references>"
- **Discussion**: "<decision and reasoning>"
- **Already addressed**: "Addressed in `<sha>`."
- **Won't fix**: "Keeping current approach because <reason>."
- **Follow-up**: "Created #<num> to track this."

### Step 4: Create Follow-up Issues

For valid out-of-scope improvements:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "<description>" \
  --body "Identified during PR review of #<PR_NUMBER>.

> <reviewer's comment>

Proposed solution: <what should be done>"
```

### Step 5: Push and Summarize

```bash
git push
```

Report: feedback items addressed, commits created, follow-up issues created, items needing human decision.

## Guidelines

- **GraphQL for discovery** — REST API doesn't show resolution status
- **Reply individually** — keeps discussions organized and threads resolvable
- **Reply immediately** — address, reply, then move to next thread
- **Be specific** — reference commits, line numbers, and code
- **Test changes** — run checks before committing
- **Granular commits** — one per logical change

## Related Skills

**If the feedback required substantial changes:** Use `forge-reflect` for one more self-review before re-requesting review.

## Example Usage

```
/forge-address-pr-feedback 123
/forge-address-pr-feedback 123 -- prioritize security comments and avoid broad refactors
/forge-address-pr-feedback https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
/forge-address-pr-feedback
```
