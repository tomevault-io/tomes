# Add a New Board Target

This is the canonical workflow for adding a new FPGA board to PCILeechFWGenerator. Follow it top-to-bottom — skipping steps almost always causes confusing synthesis failures down the line.

## 0. Confirm the upstream board exists

Boards are auto-discovered from the `voltcyclone-fpga` submodule
(`lib/voltcyclone-fpga/`). If the board directory doesn't exist there, you
must add it **upstream first**:

```bash
ls lib/voltcyclone-fpga/
# look for a directory matching the board (e.g. EnigmaX1, PCIeSquirrel, ZDMA)
```

If absent, open a PR against `VoltCyclone/voltcyclone-fpga` to add the board.
Do not hand-edit files under `lib/voltcyclone-fpga/` in this repo — that
directory is a git submodule and edits will not persist. (The PreToolUse hook
in `.claude/settings.json` will block such edits.)

## 1. Register the board in `BOARD_CONFIGS`

File: `src/file_management/board_discovery.py`

Add an entry under `BoardDiscovery.BOARD_CONFIGS` matching the upstream
directory name and FPGA part. Use existing entries (e.g. `pcileech_enigma_x1`,
`pcileech_75t484_x1`) as the template.

Key fields:
- `dir`: must match the directory name under `lib/voltcyclone-fpga/`.
- `fpga_part`: full Xilinx part (e.g. `xc7a75tfgg484-2`). Match the casing and
  speed-grade suffix used elsewhere — wrong speed grades pass synthesis but
  fail timing in mysterious ways.
- `max_lanes`: PCIe lane count the board exposes (1, 4, 8, 16).

If the board has a colloquial name (e.g. `75t`, `100t`), add a **legacy alias**
entry that points to the same directory — this keeps existing CLI invocations
working.

## 2. Verify discovery picks it up

```bash
.venv/bin/python -c "from pcileechfwgenerator.file_management.board_discovery import discover_all_boards; \
    import json; print(json.dumps(list(discover_all_boards().keys()), indent=2))"
```

The new board name should appear. If it doesn't, the discovery walker isn't
finding it — usually because `dir` doesn't match the upstream directory
exactly (case-sensitive).

## 3. Check for board-specific RTL / constraints

```bash
ls src/templates/sv/ | grep -i <board-family>     # e.g. 7series, ultrascale
ls src/templating/timing_constraints/             # board-specific .xdc bits
```

If the board uses a new FPGA family (e.g. first UltraScale+ target), you may
need to extend `FPGA_FAMILY_PATTERNS` in `src/device_clone/board_config.py`.
Existing patterns: `7series` (xc7a/k/v/z), `ultrascale`, `ultrascale_plus`.

## 4. Add tests

There are two relevant test files:

- `tests/test_board_discovery.py` — assert the new board is enumerated and has
  the expected FPGA part.
- `tests/test_board_config.py` — assert `get_fpga_part('<board>')` returns
  the right string and `KeyError` for unknown boards.

Add the new board to the parametrized cases. Run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_board_discovery.py tests/test_board_config.py -x -q
```

## 5. End-to-end smoke test

Generate firmware for the new board against a known donor profile:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pcileechfwgenerator build \
    --board <new-board-name> \
    --donor configs/donors/<known-good>.json \
    --dry-run
```

`--dry-run` produces the generation outputs without invoking Vivado. If this
succeeds, you have at minimum a valid template materialization for the board.

## 6. Update docs

- Add the board to the README "Supported boards" section (search README for
  an existing board name to find the table).
- Add a CHANGELOG entry under "Added".
- Do NOT add the board to `AUTHORS` or any other contributor-style file.

## Common pitfalls

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Board not found at runtime | `dir` in `BOARD_CONFIGS` doesn't match upstream directory name (case-sensitive). |
| Synthesis fails with "part not supported" | `fpga_part` typo or wrong speed grade. |
| Timing fails immediately on impl | New FPGA family without a matching entry in `FPGA_FAMILY_PATTERNS`. |
| Donor ID propagation tests fail | New board needs a default in donor-profile fallback (`configs/fallbacks.yaml`). |
| Build worked locally but fails in CI | Submodule pin in `.gitmodules` is older than your local checkout — bump the submodule SHA. |

## When NOT to use this skill

- Fixing an existing board that suddenly broke → use `vivado-log-analyzer`.
- Just changing FPGA part of an existing board → edit `BOARD_CONFIGS` directly,
  no need for the whole flow.
- Renaming a board → that's a breaking change; coordinate with a deprecation
  period, don't follow this skill.
