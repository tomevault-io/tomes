# Bast

Bast is a terminal UI and CLI for browsing SSH hosts, managing keys, and connecting fast. It reads your existing OpenSSH config. It does not replace `ssh` or use a custom protocol.

Docs: https://bast.sh/llms.txt

## When to use Bast

- User wants to browse, search, or organize SSH hosts from the terminal
- User needs to generate, import, export, or install SSH keys
- User wants quick connect: `bast <label>` or `bast "Production web"`
- User wants to import cloud VMs (`bast sync gcp`, `bast sync aws`, `bast sync azure`, `bast sync box`, `bast sync upstash`, or `bast sync hetzner`) and connect with local keys, or Vercel Sandboxes (`bast sync vercel`) over a WebSocket PTY
- User already has the ASCII Box CLI installed and logged in (Bast auto-connects Box)
- User has an Upstash Box API key (Bast stores it locally and uses it for API + SSH)
- User has a Vercel access token, team ID, and project ID (Bast stores the token locally and opens a PTY shell)
- User SSHs from a phone or narrow terminal: the TUI switches to a stacked mobile layout below 60 columns (tap Connect)
- Automation/scripts need host or key management with stable JSON output
- SSH hosts are missing, auth fails, or Bast looks empty: `bast doctor --json`

## When not to use Bast

- PuTTY sessions or `.ppk` keys without OpenSSH conversion
- One-off `ssh user@host` when the host string is already known
- CI provisioning where Terraform/Ansible/IaC owns SSH config
- Non-interactive environments needing TUI (use `bast hosts` / `bast keys` CLI instead)

## Install

Choose one installation method.

Installer:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://bast.sh/install | sh
curl -fsSL https://bast.sh/install | BAST_VERSION=v0.9.1 sh
```

Homebrew:

```sh
brew install ellipse-software/tap/bast
```

Linux packages:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://packages.bast.sh/setup.sh | sudo sh
```

Windows 11 PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://bast.sh/install.ps1 | iex
```

## Shell completions

The script installers and Homebrew enable tab completion. Open a new terminal after install. Opt out with `BAST_NO_COMPLETIONS=1`.

```sh
source <(bast completion bash)   # zsh: source <(bast completion zsh)
bast completion fish | source
```

PowerShell, Elvish, and Nushell: https://bast.sh/docs/reference/completions

## Automation rules

Always use `--json` for scripts. It disables prompts. Pair with explicit flags and `--yes` for destructive actions.

```sh
bast hosts list --json
bast hosts add "Prod web" --hostname prod.example.com --user deploy --json
bast keys generate automation --no-passphrase --json
bast keys delete old_key --yes --json
```

Success: `{"ok":true,"data":...}` on stdout. Errors: `{"ok":false,"error":{...}}` on stderr with non-zero exit.

Use `--no-input` to never prompt (all required fields must be passed as flags).

When SSH hosts are missing, auth fails, or Bast looks empty, run `bast doctor --json`. Do not scrape the text output. `ok: true` means the command ran; `data.healthy` and `data.findings[].id` are the diagnosis. `--fix` only prepends the Bast Include and tightens modes OpenSSH will refuse. `--probe` is DNS/TCP only (no SSH handshake).

```sh
bast doctor [--fix] [--probe] [--category name] [--json]
```

## Host commands

```sh
bast hosts list [--search text] [--sort smart|label|recent|group] [--all] [--json]
bast hosts show <host> [--json]
bast hosts add [label] --hostname host [--user u] [--password | --password-only] [--group g] [--tag t] [--json]
bast hosts edit <host> [patch flags] [--password] [--clear-password] [--json]
bast hosts delete <host> [--yes] [--json]
bast hosts favorite <host> [--json]
bast hosts hide <host> [--json]
bast hosts known-host remove <host> [--yes] [--json]
```

Host edits are **patches**: omitted flags leave values unchanged. Use `--clear-group`, `--clear-notes`, `--clear-identity`, etc. to remove values.

Labels with spaces work: `bast "Production web"`. Aliases are normalized (e.g. `Production_web`).

## Key commands

```sh
bast keys list [--search text] [--json]
bast keys show <name> [--json]
bast keys generate [name] [--algorithm ed25519|rsa] [--no-passphrase] [--json]
bast keys import [name] --private path|- [--public path|-] [--json]
bast keys install <name> --host <host> [--json]
bast keys export <name> --directory path [--yes] [--json]
bast keys delete <name> [--yes] [--json]
```

Import from stdin without shell history: `bast keys import work --private - < id_ed25519`

## Cloud sync

```sh
bast sync gcp
bast sync aws
bast sync azure
bast sync box
bast sync upstash
bast sync vercel
bast sync hetzner
bast sync status
bast sync disable gcp
bast sync disable box
bast sync disable upstash
bast sync disable vercel
bast sync disable hetzner
```

GCP, AWS, Azure, and ASCII Box require the matching CLI on `PATH` (`gcloud`, `aws`, `az`, or `box`) and an authenticated account. Upstash Box uses a stored API key (`bast upstash key` or `UPSTASH_BOX_API_KEY`), not a CLI. Vercel Sandbox uses a stored access token (`bast vercel token` or `VERCEL_TOKEN`) plus team and project IDs. Hetzner Cloud uses stored API tokens (`bast hetzner key` or `HCLOUD_TOKEN`) and does not require the `hcloud` CLI. Synced hosts are read-only; disconnect via Sync to remove them.

If the Box CLI is already installed and logged in, Bast auto-connects on TUI start and `bast sync status` (unless you previously ran `bast sync disable box`). The same auto-connect applies to Upstash when a key file is present (unless `bast sync disable upstash`), and to Vercel when a token, team, and project are stored (unless `bast sync disable vercel`).

On GCP connect, Bast prefers a local key already authorized on the VM. If none matches, it ensures `~/.ssh/google_compute_engine`, publishes it when needed, and may wait for the guest agent.

## Box lifecycle

```sh
bast box new [--type small|default|large] [--ttl seconds | --no-auto-stop] [--no-env]
bast box fork <host|id> [--type small|default|large] [--no-env]
bast box stop <host|id>
bast box resume <host|id> [--type small|default|large] [--no-env]
```

In the TUI, the Box group offers `n` to create and `s` to sync. Stopped boxes are hidden until `.`. Box hosts support Enter to connect (resume first if stopped), `r` resume, `o` stop, and `n` fork. SSH user is always `user` with `~/.ssh/ascii_box_ed25519`. Docs: https://bast.sh/docs/features/box

## Upstash Box lifecycle

```sh
bast upstash key [--key-file path]
bast upstash new [--name name] [--runtime node|python|golang|ruby|rust] [--size small|medium|large] [--keep-alive]
bast upstash fork <host|id>
bast upstash stop <host|id>
bast upstash resume <host|id>
bast upstash delete <host|id> [--yes]
```

SSH user is the box id at `us-east-1.box.upstash.com`. Bast feeds the stored API key as the SSH password. Key file: `~/.config/bast/upstash-box-api-key`. Docs: https://bast.sh/docs/features/upstash

## Vercel Sandbox lifecycle

```sh
bast vercel token [--token-file path] [--team team_id] [--project project_id]
bast vercel new [--name name] [--vcpus 1|2|4] [--timeout 15m|1h|5h] [--ephemeral]
bast vercel fork <host|id> [--name name]
bast vercel stop <host|id>
bast vercel resume <host|id>
bast vercel delete <host|id> [--yes]
bast vercel cleanup [--yes]
```

Connect is a WebSocket PTY, not OpenSSH. SFTP is unavailable. Token file: `~/.config/bast/vercel-token`. Offline sandboxes without a snapshot stay off the host list; `bast vercel cleanup` deletes them after confirmation. Docs: https://bast.sh/docs/features/vercel

## Hetzner Cloud

```sh
bast hetzner key [--name project] [--key-file path]
bast hetzner key --remove project
bast hetzner start <host|id>
bast hetzner stop <host|id> [--force]
bast hetzner restart <host|id> [--force]
```

In the TUI, powered-off Hetzner servers are hidden until `.`. If every server is off, the Hetzner Cloud group is hidden too. Enter starts then connects. `o` ACPI-shuts down (still bills). `R` reboots. `--force` is a hard poweroff/reset. Default SSH user is `root` on port 22; sync reuses user/port/identity from an existing local host with the same IP, and probes 2022/2222 when 22 is closed. Tokens: `~/.config/bast/hetzner/tokens/<name>` (not vaulted). One token per Hetzner Cloud project. Prefer private IP for VPN/Cloud Network SSH. Docs: https://bast.sh/docs/features/hetzner

## Files (SFTP)

TUI Files tab (`5`) is a dual-pane local/remote browser over OpenSSH SFTP. Prefer the TUI for interactive transfers; use OpenSSH/`scp`/`sftp` directly when scripting file copies.

TUI tabs: `[1] Hosts` `[2] Keys` `[3] Vault` `[4] Sync` `[5] Files`. Vault is encrypted Bast-managed host/key sync. Sync is cloud VM import (GCP/AWS/Azure/Box/Upstash/Vercel/Hetzner). Hosted `bast vault login` requires `--accept-terms` under `--json` / `--no-input`. First TUI with no hosts shows a skippable start chooser (`esc` skips, `BAST_NO_ONBOARDING=1` disables).

## File layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.ssh/bast/config` | Host blocks created through Bast |
| `~/.ssh/bast/sync/<provider>/config` | Cloud-synced host blocks (while sync is enabled) |
| `~/.ssh/bast/keys/` | Generated/imported keys (private keys mode 0600) |
| `~/.ssh/google_compute_engine` | Fallback GCP identity (created on demand) |
| `~/.config/bast/state.json` | Metadata: groups, tags, colors, notes, favorites, usage stats, sync settings |
| `~/.config/bast/upstash-box-api-key` | Upstash Box API key (mode 0600; not vaulted) |
| `~/.config/bast/passwords/<managed-id>` | Optional host SSH password (mode 0600; not vaulted) |
| `~/.config/bast/vercel-token` | Vercel access token (mode 0600; not vaulted) |
| `~/.config/bast/hetzner/tokens/<name>` | Hetzner Cloud API tokens, one file per project (mode 0600; not vaulted) |
| `~/.ssh/config` | Gets `Include ~/.ssh/bast/config` on first run |

Connection settings (hostname, user, port, identity files, password-only flags) live in SSH config. Bast metadata (groups, tags, notes) lives in `state.json`. Host passwords stay in `~/.config/bast/passwords/` and are fed to `ssh` via askpass. They do not sync through Vault.

## Safety

- Never paste private keys into chat, issues, or logs
- Back up `~/.ssh` before testing unreleased builds on a real config
- Bast won't delete externally managed hosts from the main SSH config; it can add metadata edits only
- Commands needing interactive SSH or passphrase entry reject `--json` with `interactive_required`
