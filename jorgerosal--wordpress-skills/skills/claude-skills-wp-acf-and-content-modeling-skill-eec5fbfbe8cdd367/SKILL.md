# WordPress ACF and Content Modeling Skill

## Overview

Systematic review skill for WordPress projects that rely on Advanced Custom Fields and custom content architecture. **Core principle:** a healthy WordPress content model is durable, query-aware, editor-friendly, and predictable to migrate. Review focuses on CPT and taxonomy design, field-group boundaries, naming consistency, storage strategy, ACF JSON synchronization, and the long-term cost of meta-heavy patterns. Report findings grouped by file or subsystem with severity labels (`CRITICAL`, `WARNING`, `INFO`), line references where possible, and concrete remediation guidance.

## When to Use

**Use when:**
- Auditing a plugin or theme that registers custom post types, taxonomies, or ACF field groups
- Reviewing `acf_add_local_field_group()` or field group JSON exports
- Checking whether repeaters / flexible content are the right fit for the content problem
- Evaluating options pages, relationship fields, clone fields, or block field groups
- Investigating slow admin screens or expensive `meta_query` usage in content-heavy builds
- Planning a new content model for an editorial site, directory, landing-page builder, or headless setup
- Reviewing ACF JSON sync, field key drift, or environment-to-environment portability

**Don't use for:**
- Generic plugin architecture without meaningful ACF/content-model work (use `wp-plugin-development`)
- Pure REST route design (use `wp-rest-api-development`)
- Gutenberg block implementation details unrelated to field modeling (use `wp-block-development`)
- Performance audits not tied to content schema or metadata access (use `wp-performance-review`)
- WooCommerce domain modeling (use `wp-woocommerce-dev` unless the issue is truly generic ACF modeling)

## Review Workflow

Follow this seven-step workflow.

1. **Identify the model boundary**
   - What is the real domain: articles, locations, staff, products, events, landing pages, settings, or reusable content fragments?
   - Determine whether the model is single-site, multisite, or headless-facing.
   - Inventory CPTs, taxonomies, options pages, and field groups before evaluating implementation quality.

2. **Check core content entities first**
   - Validate each CPT has a clear purpose and does not merely duplicate posts/pages without a reason.
   - Check whether taxonomies model classification and relationships better than extra text/meta fields.
   - Flag overloaded post types used as catch-alls for unrelated content.

3. **Review field-group architecture**
   - Inspect location rules, naming conventions, instructions, conditional logic, defaults, and required flags.
   - Check whether field groups are split by editorial task instead of becoming giant monoliths.
   - Verify repeaters and flexible content are used intentionally, not as a substitute for missing entity design.

4. **Scan for CRITICAL patterns**
   - Field names or data shapes changed without a migration path.
   - Environment-specific field keys relied on directly in code.
   - Content that should be relational or taxonomic stored as plain text blobs.
   - Massive `meta_query` dependence for core archive/search behavior with no mitigation.
   - Flexible-content or repeater structures used where separate entities are clearly required.
   - Options-page values treated as request-specific content without cache or invalidation awareness.

5. **Check WARNING patterns**
   - Ambiguous field names (`title`, `image`, `link`) with no domain prefix or context.
   - Duplicate field groups or cloned definitions drifting across environments.
   - Relationship/post object fields with no return-format consistency.
   - Fields exposed to editors with weak instructions, no defaults, or unclear conditional logic.
   - ACF JSON enabled inconsistently or committed unreliably.
   - Repeater-heavy landing pages likely to become impossible to query, reuse, or migrate.

6. **Note INFO improvements**
   - Taxonomies could improve filtering, SEO, or editorial consistency.
   - An options page could replace duplicated per-page settings.
   - A custom table may be justified for high-volume structured data.
   - Shared components may benefit from clone fields or a reusable block strategy.
   - Field instructions, tabs, and groups could reduce editor error rates.

7. **Report with context-aware severity**
   - Enterprise/editorial site: prioritize governance, migration safety, query behavior, and authoring ergonomics.
   - Marketing/landing-page builder: prioritize maintainability and editorial constraints over abstract purity.
   - Headless site: prioritize schema stability, API exposure shape, and relationship modeling.
   - Add cross-skill notes when findings should be followed by `wp-rest-api-development`, `wp-performance-review`, or `wp-block-development`.

## Model-Level Checks

### Content Type Design (ACF-01)

**CRITICAL**
- Multiple unrelated business concepts forced into one CPT with flags like `type`, `layout`, or `kind` doing all the work
- A CPT exists only to simulate grouped fields that belong on an existing content type
- Important relational content stored in serialized arrays or long text fields instead of structured entities

**WARNING**
- CPT labels, supports, or archive behavior do not match editorial intent
- Post types rely on custom fields for primary titles or slugs when core title/slug should carry that job
- Content discoverability depends entirely on custom sorting/meta instead of taxonomy or date semantics

**INFO**
- A taxonomy may be better than another boolean/select field
- A small reusable post type may simplify repeated section content or shared landing-page fragments

### Taxonomy Design (ACF-02)

**CRITICAL**
- Taxonomy-worthy classification modeled as free-text fields, causing duplicate spellings and broken filters
- Relationship semantics forced into repeated text/select fields instead of terms or relationship fields

**WARNING**
- Taxonomies are too broad, mixing audience, topic, location, and workflow state in one structure
- A hierarchical taxonomy is used where flat tagging would be simpler, or vice versa
- Term metadata is added for core entity content that likely deserves its own entity instead

**INFO**
- Taxonomies can often replace fragile editor-entered labels and improve queryability

### Field Naming and Schema Stability (ACF-03)

**CRITICAL**
- Code depends on field keys like `field_123abc` instead of stable field names when not required
- Field names renamed with no migration or backward-compatibility handling
- Two unrelated fields share nearly identical names across contexts, leading to template confusion

**WARNING**
- Names are too generic (`title`, `cta`, `copy`, `image`) and lose meaning outside one template
- Prefixing is inconsistent across domains (`hero_`, `event_`, `team_` mixed unpredictably)
- Return formats vary silently between field groups for the same conceptual field

**INFO**
- Prefix related fields by domain or component to improve grepability and future migrations

### Repeater and Flexible Content Usage (ACF-04)

**CRITICAL**
- Flexible content is used as a full site-builder without governance, creating untestable content permutations
- Repeaters hold data that needs independent URLs, reuse, ownership, or filtering
- Huge nested repeaters are queried or transformed as if they were relational tables

**WARNING**
- Repeater rows have no min/max limits or editor guidance
- Flexible content layouts overlap heavily and indicate missing design-system discipline
- Deep nesting makes migrations, previews, and template maintenance brittle

**INFO**
- Consider dedicated entities, synced patterns, or block-based composition for reusable structures

### Relationship Fields and Return Formats (ACF-05)

**CRITICAL**
- Relationship/post-object fields used without a stable expected return format in code
- Bidirectional relationships are assumed but never maintained consistently

**WARNING**
- Templates call `get_field()` repeatedly inside loops when values could be normalized once
- Relationship field queries are not constrained, making editorial selection noisy and error-prone
- IDs vs objects vs arrays are mixed casually across code paths

**INFO**
- Normalize field access through view-model helpers or DTO-like mappers when templates become repetitive

### Options Pages and Global Settings (ACF-06)

**CRITICAL**
- Frequently changing request-level content is stored globally and expected to vary per page/user/context
- Critical runtime configuration is edited through ACF options with no validation or deployment discipline

**WARNING**
- Sitewide content is duplicated across pages instead of centralized in options/global entities
- Options pages mix marketing copy, integration secrets, and editorial settings in one screen
- Code assumes options always exist and never handles empty defaults

**INFO**
- Split options pages by responsibility and add defaults/instructions for resilience

### ACF JSON and Environment Sync (ACF-07)

**CRITICAL**
- Field-group changes exist only in the database with no committed JSON or export path
- Team workflow routinely overwrites field definitions because sync direction is unclear

**WARNING**
- `acf-json` is committed inconsistently or partially
- Field groups are edited in production without a promotion path
- Local JSON path configuration differs between environments without documentation

**INFO**
- Keep `acf-json` under version control and treat DB-only edits as temporary until exported

### Meta Query and Storage Performance (ACF-08)

**CRITICAL**
- Primary archive/search behavior depends on multiple unindexed `meta_query` clauses at scale
- Repeater/flexible content values are mined through `LIKE` queries for business-critical views
- Numeric/date filtering uses string comparison semantics or inconsistent storage formats

**WARNING**
- Content modeling encourages many joins against `postmeta` for every request
- Derived/aggregated values are recalculated from nested ACF data on each page load
- Query behavior assumes ACF fields are cheap just because the admin UI is convenient

**INFO**
- Promote high-volume query keys into taxonomies, dedicated lookup tables, or precomputed indexes when needed

## Review Heuristics

### Good ACF signs
- Field groups align with clear editorial tasks or components
- CPTs and taxonomies reflect real business entities
- Names are stable, descriptive, and domain-prefixed
- ACF JSON is committed and environment sync is intentional
- Relationship fields and return formats are normalized in code
- Meta usage supports the scale and query patterns of the site

### Common anti-patterns
- “Everything is a page with flexible content forever”
- “Everything is post meta even when it should be taxonomy or a dedicated entity”
- “Editors can build anything” without constraints or safe defaults
- “We query repeater internals directly”
- “We changed field names and hoped templates would keep working”

- `references/acf-json-and-field-group-guide.md`
- `references/meta-query-and-performance.md`

## Final Reminder

This skill should not reward ACF usage merely because it works in the admin. Prefer models that stay understandable after the site doubles in content, editors, and integrations.
