# Codex Headless WordPress and WPGraphQL Review

## Purpose

Use this skill when Codex should review a decoupled WordPress stack that exposes content through WPGraphQL and serves it through a separate frontend such as Next.js, Gatsby, Remix, or another JS application.

## Focus Areas

- Schema boundaries and content modeling
- Resolver/query performance and pagination
- Preview, draft, and auth correctness
- Caching, persisted queries, builds, and revalidation

## Workflow

1. Identify WPGraphQL schema extensions, frontend query documents, and preview/build flows.
2. Check data boundaries and unpublished-content exposure first.
3. Review resolver efficiency, pagination, and over-fetching risks.
4. Load only the shared references needed from `../../claude-skills/wp-headless-and-wpgraphql/references/`.
5. Report findings with severity, file references, impact, and safer patterns.
