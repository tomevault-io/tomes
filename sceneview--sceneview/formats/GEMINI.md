# SceneView — Claude Code guide

## Project purpose

SceneView is an **AI-first SDK**: its primary goal is to enable Claude (and other AI
assistants) to help developers build 3D and AR apps in Jetpack Compose. Every design
decision — API surface, documentation, samples, `llms.txt` — should be optimized so
that when a developer asks an AI "build me an AR app", the AI can produce correct,
complete, working code on the first try.

**Implication for contributors:** when adding or changing APIs, always ask "can an AI
read the docs and generate correct code for this?" If not, simplify the API or improve
the documentation until it can.

> **Start here.** Read [`.claude/STATE.md`](.claude/STATE.md) for *where we are* and
> [`.claude/workflows/README.md`](.claude/workflows/README.md) for *how we work* (the v2
> working methodology). This file holds stable project facts only — never session state.

## QUALITY RULES (MANDATORY — every session, every commit)

**ZERO TOLERANCE for bugs reaching the user.** Every change must be verified before push.

### Before EVERY push to main:
1. **Compile check**: `./gradlew :sceneview:compileReleaseKotlin :arsceneview:compileReleaseKotlin`
2. **Unit tests**: `./gradlew :sceneview:testDebugUnitTest :arsceneview:testDebugUnitTest`
3. **Bundle build** (if store-affecting): `./gradlew :samples:android-demo:bundleRelease`
4. **Website JS** (if website changed): `node -c website-static/js/sceneview.js`
5. **Full gate**: `bash .claude/scripts/pre-push-check.sh`

### Rules:
- NEVER push code that doesn't compile
- NEVER push without running tests
- NEVER modify website JS without validating syntax
- NEVER deploy to stores without verifying the bundle builds locally first
- When an agent modifies code, ALWAYS verify compilation before committing
- If a review finds blockers, fix them ALL before pushing — no exceptions
- If you bump `gradle/libs.versions.toml` → `filament = "X.Y.Z"`, you MUST recompile every `.filamat` blob in the same PR with the matching `matc` toolchain — see [CONTRIBUTING.md "Filament runtime ↔ .filamat ABI invariant"](CONTRIBUTING.md#filament-runtime---filamat-abi-invariant). v4.1.0 shipped split halves and crashed 10 demos at runtime.

### Quality plan: `.claude/plans/v4.0-quality-plan.md`

## Device QA

The **autonomous device-QA harness** (umbrella [#1560](https://github.com/sceneview/sceneview/issues/1560))
drives the demo apps **like a real user** — taps, swipes, camera-orbit drags,
navigation — and asserts no crash across every platform, unattended (no
screenshot-by-screenshot loop). CI-green plus self-review is not enough: a demo
can compile, pass unit tests, and still crash the moment it renders on a device.

### Run it

```bash
# Full cross-platform pass — every platform feasible on this host.
bash .claude/scripts/device-qa.sh --platform=all

# One platform, or a fast per-category subset.
bash .claude/scripts/device-qa.sh --platform=android
bash .claude/scripts/device-qa.sh --platform=web --fast
```

`device-qa.sh` is the single orchestrator entrypoint. It boots the
emulator/simulator each leg needs, builds + installs the demo app, delegates to
the per-platform harness, and aggregates every verdict into one
`device-qa-report.json` at the repo root (override the directory with `--out`).
Exit status is non-zero if any selected platform failed. Flags: `--platform=android|ios|web|ar|all`,
`--fast` (per-category subset, not the full catalog), `--ci` (treat a skipped
platform as a failure), `--out <dir>`.

### What each leg covers

| Leg | Harness | Drives | Report |
|---|---|---|---|
| `android` | Maestro flows `.maestro/android/` via `qa-android-demos.sh` | All 53 demos on an emulator | `device-qa-report.json` |
| `ios` | Maestro flows `.maestro/ios/` via `ios-device-qa.sh` | 63 deep-linkable demos on a simulator (AR = launch-only smoke) | `device-qa-report.json` |
| `web` | Playwright suite `samples/web-demo/tests/` | Browser 3D viewer + every catalog tab | `web-qa-summary.json` |
| `ar` | `ar-replay-qa.sh` + `ARReplayHarnessTest` | Every Android AR demo replayed against recorded ARCore sessions — no physical device | `ar-qa-summary.json` |

See [`.maestro/README.md`](.maestro/README.md) for the Maestro flow layout and
known limitations (no pinch gesture → 3D zoom is driven via deep-link param).

**iOS leg status — CI-wired since #2833 (2026-07-20), advisory.** `device-qa.yml`
now defines an `ios` job (Maestro / Simulator; routed to the self-hosted
`sceneview-mac` runner when its heartbeat is fresh, `macos-15` otherwise), the
nightly runs it via `device-qa.sh --platform=ios --fast --ci`, and
`render-tests.yml`'s iOS job drives the `SceneViewDemoUITests` UI-testing
target with real `XCTAttachment` screenshots. The leg is in the default
ADVISORY set — a red ios leg is a `WARN`, not a release block. Caveat: on the
self-hosted Mac the leg is disk-gated (< 10 GB free → honest advisory skip),
so keep the host's disk above the gate for real coverage.

### Release-checkpoint mandate

**A full device-QA pass runs at every release checkpoint, before tagging.**
No release ships with a red *blocking* leg in `device-qa-report.json`. The
gate is enforced in two places — keep both honest:

- `release-checklist.sh` **section 14** reads the report's graded
  `releaseGate.verdict` and fails the checklist on a `blocked` verdict (or a
  missing report).
- The `/release` skill (**Step 6.5**) runs `device-qa.sh --platform=all`
  before the tag step.

#### Release-gate policy for `continue-on-error` legs (#1651)

The legs are **graded**, because they are not equally reliable:

| Leg | CI behaviour | Release gate |
|---|---|---|
| `web` | NOT `continue-on-error` — a red leg fails the workflow | **BLOCKING** — a red web leg is a release `FAIL` |
| `android`, `ar` | `continue-on-error: true` (flaky SwiftShader emulator, #1643) | **ADVISORY** — a red leg is a `WARN`, never a silent pass, never a hard block |

`device-qa.sh` tags each leg `advisory: true|false` (default advisory set:
`android,ar,ios,web-perf,sketchfab,arcore-cloud`, override with
`--advisory=<csv>`) and pre-computes
`releaseGate.verdict` in `device-qa-report.json`:

- `clear` — every leg passed → checklist `PASS`.
- `warn` — an advisory leg (android/ar) did not pass → checklist `WARN`
  ("advisory leg(s) did not pass: … — review before tagging"). A human sees
  it, but it does not block the release.
- `blocked` — a blocking leg (web) failed → checklist `FAIL`, hard block.

Advisory legs stay non-blocking until #1643/#1645 make the emulator reliably
green; then promote them to blocking by shrinking the `--advisory=` set. A red
*blocking* leg means a demo crashes for a real user — fix it before tagging,
no exceptions.

#### Android Vitals release-gate (#1691)

Device-QA validates the demo app on **emulators** *before* release. Android
Vitals is the complementary post-release signal: the **real crash & ANR rate**
across live Play Store users.

- `release-checklist.sh` **section 15** runs `.claude/scripts/play-vitals.sh`,
  which queries the **Play Developer Reporting API** for
  `io.github.sceneview.demo` and grades the 28-day user-perceived crash & ANR
  rates against Google Play's bad-behaviour thresholds (crash 1.09%, ANR 0.47%).
- **Advisory-first**: the gate is `WARN`-only by default and never freezes a
  release. A missing `PLAY_STORE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` secret, the 403 you get
  before the read-only **"View app quality information"** Play Console
  permission is granted, or a fresh app with no data all degrade to `WARN`.
  Set `PLAY_VITALS_HARD=1` to promote a hard-threshold breach to a release
  blocker once the numbers are trusted.
- Reuses the existing deploy service account — **no new write scope**.

#### Play Store reviews → triage issues (#1692)

`maintenance.yml`'s `play-reviews` job runs daily, ingesting Play Store
ratings + written reviews via the Android Publisher `reviews.list` API (same
deploy service account, read-only). Reviews matching a crash/bug signal —
or 1-star reviews with a real comment — auto-open a **de-duplicated** triage
issue (keyed by the stable Play `reviewId`) with the review text, device, and
app version. **Documented API gaps:** `reviews.list` only returns reviews from
≈the last week, and install counts are not exposed by any queryable Play API
(only bulk CSV reports) — both are surfaced honestly rather than faked.

## About

SceneView provides 3D and AR as declarative UI for Android (Jetpack Compose, Filament,
ARCore) and Apple platforms (SwiftUI, RealityKit, ARKit) — iOS, macOS, and visionOS —
with shared logic in Kotlin Multiplatform.

## Full API reference

See [`llms.txt`](./llms.txt) at the repo root for the complete, machine-readable API reference:
composable signatures, node types, resource loading, threading rules, and common patterns.

## Design System

See [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) for the complete design system: colors, typography, spacing,
radius, shadows, motion, breakpoints, and component patterns.

**Rules:**
- Always read `DESIGN.md` before generating any UI code (website, app, docs)
- Use CSS custom properties — never hardcode color/spacing/radius values
- Support both light and dark modes
- Follow Material 3 Expressive patterns

**The demo-app UI is reference-driven, not tool-generated.** Do NOT use Stitch, v0, or
Figma to author the demo app's Compose/SwiftUI chrome — that path shipped a poor UI in
v4.1.0 (generic cards, flat hierarchy) because a web-oriented design tool does not know
it is framing a 3D Filament viewport. Instead, design natively against `DESIGN.md` tokens,
anchored on real reference apps (Sketchfab mobile, Polycam, Reality Composer, Apple Quick
Look, Google Scene Viewer), then verify visually on device/emulator before every push.
The "Spatial Studio"-style redesign that this method produced is the bar to clear.

Design tools stay fine for **marketing** surfaces (store screenshots, website hero shots),
where pixel precision has real ROI — never for the app chrome itself.

## When writing any SceneView code

- Use `SceneView { }` for 3D-only scenes (`io.github.sceneview:sceneview:4.25.0`)
- Use `ARSceneView { }` for augmented reality (`io.github.sceneview:arsceneview:4.25.0`)
- Declare nodes as composables inside the trailing content block — not imperatively
- Load models with `rememberModelInstance(modelLoader, "models/file.glb")` — returns `null`
  while loading, always handle the null case
- `LightNode`'s `apply` is a **named parameter** (`apply = { intensity(…) }`), not a trailing lambda
- For AR record-replay debugging, use `rememberARRecorder()` to capture sessions and
  `ARSceneView(playbackDataset = file)` to replay them — see `llms.txt` "AR Recording & Playback"

## Critical threading rule

Filament JNI calls must run on the **main thread**. Never call `modelLoader.createModel*`
or `materialLoader.*` from a background coroutine directly.
`rememberModelInstance` handles this correctly — use it in composables.
For imperative code, use `modelLoader.loadModelInstanceAsync`.

## Android CLI (preferred for agent-driven QA)

Google's [`android` CLI](https://developer.android.com/tools/agents/android-cli)
(tested against **v1.0.15498356** — stable, Google I/O May 2026, adds the
`android studio *` subcommands; the Journeys-from-CLI that Google's docs
announce is **NOT in this binary** (no `journeys` command — verified on-device
2026-07-09) — and still compatible with the first-release **v0.7.15411012**,
April 2026) is the agent-focused
front-end for `adb` / `uiautomator` / `emulator` / `sdkmanager`. Install note:
`dl.google.com/.../latest/` still serves **0.7**; reaching 1.0 requires running
`android update` afterwards (global upgrade — the unpacked payload in
`~/.android/bin` is shared, no side-by-side). SceneView's QA scripts
and CI install it on the fly and use it for:

- `android layout --device=<serial> -o ui.json --pretty` — JSON UI tree with
  **precomputed `center` coords** per node (no `uiautomator dump` XML parsing, no
  `bounds` regex). `--diff` returns only nodes changed since the last invocation.
- `android screen capture --output ui.png` — PNG screenshot that bypasses the adb
  shell PTY, so it doesn't suffer the **LF/CRLF translation that the legacy
  `adb shell screencap -p > file` form does** (modern `adb exec-out screencap` also
  bypasses the PTY and is fine).
- `android screen capture --annotate` + `android screen resolve --screenshot=ui.png
  --string="tap #5"` — visual-label tapping (the AI-first workflow this CLI exists for).
- `android run --apks=app.apk --activity=pkg/.Main` — install + launch in one call.

**When to use what:**
- Screenshots, UI dumps, install+launch → `android` CLI (via `.claude/scripts/lib/android-cli.sh`)
- `input tap/swipe/keyevent`, `am force-stop`, `pm grant`, `emu sensor set`, `logcat`,
  `adb pull` → still `adb` — the CLI has no equivalent as of v1.0 (was already the
  case in v0.7)

The helper auto-installs the CLI to `~/.local/bin/android` on first use and falls back to
`adb` if the install fails or on multi-device hosts (the `screen capture` subcommand
had no `--device` flag through v0.7 — re-verify on v1.0 — but `android layout
--device=<serial>` does work). The helper installs v1.0 via Homebrew when the
formula is available, else falls back to the direct dl.google.com download.
Telemetry is disabled via `--no-metrics` on every invocation.

**SceneView agent skills.** This repo ships three platform-specific agent
skills under [`agents/`](agents/) — see [`agents/REGISTRY.md`](agents/REGISTRY.md):

- [`agents/sceneview/SKILL.md`](agents/sceneview/SKILL.md) — Android (Jetpack Compose + ARCore)
- [`agents/sceneview-ios/SKILL.md`](agents/sceneview-ios/SKILL.md) — Apple (SwiftUI + RealityKit, iOS/macOS/visionOS)
- [`agents/sceneview-web/SKILL.md`](agents/sceneview-web/SKILL.md) — Web (Filament.js + WebXR)

Install them with:

```bash
bash .claude/scripts/install-sceneview-skill.sh        # Android
bash .claude/scripts/install-sceneview-ios-skill.sh    # iOS / macOS / visionOS
bash .claude/scripts/install-sceneview-web-skill.sh    # Web
```

After install, `android skills list` shows `sceneview`, `sceneview-ios` and
`sceneview-web` under the `xr` category, making the API contract, recipes, and
migration guide available to any AI agent on the host.
`bash .claude/scripts/android-env-check.sh --fix` installs the Android skill plus
the `android` CLI itself. The Android skill's Google `android-cli` registry
submission (issue #1082) is tracked in [`agents/REGISTRY.md`](agents/REGISTRY.md).

**Emulator-first QA (mandatory).** Routine demo QA runs on a reusable ARCore-ready
emulator — **never on a personal device**. Bootstrap it once on a fresh host:

```bash
bash .claude/scripts/setup-ar-emulator.sh
```

This creates/configures a `Pixel_7a` AVD (virtualscene back camera, emulated front
camera for Augmented Faces, 4 GB RAM, host GPU), boots it headless, and installs
Google Play Services for AR. Re-run anytime — it's idempotent. `--check` inspects
state read-only; `--clean` wipes and recreates. The emulator covers all 3D demos
and AR UI/state QA. AR features that need real world tracking (Cloud Anchor,
Streetscape/VPS, face mesh against a live face) still need a physical-device
AR Record — request one rather than driving someone's personal phone over USB.

**Golden boot snapshot — faster, deterministic QA (#1672).** The QA AVD's
userdata partition fills up after ~6 runs and Filament viewports turn black.
Seed a clean post-install boot snapshot once; every subsequent run cold-boots
from it with `-no-snapshot-save` (loads the warm state, never writes back), so
runs start identical and the partition never degrades:

```bash
bash .claude/scripts/setup-ar-emulator.sh --clean --seed-snapshot   # seed once
bash .claude/scripts/setup-ar-emulator.sh                           # restores 'qa-clean'
bash .claude/scripts/setup-ar-emulator.sh --no-snapshot             # force cold boot
```

Only the base-port emulator restores the snapshot (`-snapshot` is incompatible
with the `-read-only` pool peers); `--clean` drops the snapshot; CI is
unaffected (the GitHub emulator action has its own snapshot caching). See
[`.maestro/README.md`](.maestro/README.md) for the full rationale and the
Android Studio Journeys assessment (not adopted — blocked on an AGP 9.0.0 bump).

**Rosetta x86_64 AR rig — a probe that answered NO, kept as evidence (#2758).**

> ⛔ **Do not reach for this expecting live-camera AR QA — it was measured and it
> does not work.** The rig was built to test whether an x86_64 guest escapes the
> arm64 AR dead end. On a quiet host it *does* boot (ActivityManager registered at

>
> 1. **Same camera topology as arm64.** `dumpsys -t 300 media.camera` →

ARCore ships **no arm64 emulator build** (#2754): live-camera AR sessions can
never start on the default arm64 AVD, so AR demos there run in `qa_mode`
fallback only. The x86_64-under-Rosetta rig was the candidate escape hatch:

```bash
bash .claude/scripts/setup-ar-emulator.sh --rosetta            # provision + boot
bash .claude/scripts/setup-ar-emulator.sh --check --rosetta    # read-only rig report
```

This installs the Intel (darwin_x64) emulator bundle outside the SDK tree,
the `android-34;google_apis;x86_64` system image, creates AVD `Pixel_7a_x86`
(virtualscene back camera), boots it on **reserved port 5584 — outside the QA
pool's allocation range** (see `EMU_POOL_PORT_EXCLUDE_FROM`; 5584 is the last
console port inside adb's supported `[5555,5586]` window — higher ports make
the emulator warn that "ADB may not function properly", and the first rig
attempts on 5600 did see `adb shell` wedge mid-boot), and side-loads the
`_x86_for_emulator` ARCore APK — an install that, measured, kills `system_server`
on this guest. The run ends with the #2755 camera-topology probe, whose measured
answer here is ids `"1"`/`"10"` and no `0`. ~9 GB one-time payload,
disk-gated up front. The x86 guest runs under pure-software TCG (Apple
Silicon cannot hardware-accelerate an x86 guest), so expect a **~45 min
first boot** (measured) and ~5-10x-slower interaction, and never leased to
standard QA runs. `--clean
--rosetta` recreates only the x86 AVD — the arm64 AVD and its `qa-clean`
snapshot are never touched.

⚠️ **The rig needs the host to itself.** Its 3 GB guest gets no hardware
acceleration, so once the host starts swapping, the guest's pages go out and
boot progress collapses — the wait loop keeps reporting `adb: offline` while
qemu RSS *falls*. Observed on a 16 GB M3: a second, unrelated emulator
(2 GB, another session) booting five seconds after the rig pushed the host to
~5 GB of swap and neither guest made progress. The RAM gate cannot prevent
this on its own — two sessions measuring free RAM at the same instant both
pass it. Before a rig run: check `adb devices` for other emulators, and treat
falling qemu RSS as the signal to stop and retry on a quiet host.

**Visible (windowed) emulator — opt-in (#1660).** The emulator boots **headless
by default** (`-no-window`), which is marginally lighter on the host (skips the
skin-window draw + window-server compositing). To watch it locally, opt in:

```bash
bash .claude/scripts/setup-ar-emulator.sh --window   # windowed, this run
EMU_VISIBLE=1 bash .claude/scripts/setup-ar-emulator.sh   # equivalent env var
```

`--window` simply sets `EMU_VISIBLE=1`. The guest VM cost (RAM, pool, leases) is
identical either way — only the host window draw differs — so the default stays
headless and resource-safe. **Local only:** CI (`device-qa.yml`) never sets this
and stays headless (GitHub runners have no display).

**RAM-budgeted adaptive emulator pool (#1647 → #1654).** The harness runs an
**adaptive pool** of emulators — as many as live host RAM safely allows, with a
floor of 1 and never a rigid barrier. #1647's strict-single design is superseded:
parallel sessions / agents no longer serialise behind one emulator when the host
has RAM to spare. `setup-ar-emulator.sh` (via `lib/emulator-select.sh`):
- **computes a RAM-budgeted cap** —
  `max_emulators = floor((free_RAM − EMU_HOST_HEADROOM_MB) / EMU_RAM_BUDGET_PER_EMU_MB)`,
  clamped to `[1, EMU_POOL_MAX]` (defaults: headroom 2048 MB, budget 3072 MB/emu,
  `EMU_POOL_MAX=3`). On a RAM-tight host this resolves to 1 naturally — physics,
  not policy;
- **leases from a per-emulator pool** — each running emulator has a lease file
  (`${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/sceneview-device-qa-emu/<serial>.lease`, owner pid inside). A
  caller leases a free running emulator; else, if the running count is below the
  live cap, boots a new one on a distinct `-port` (5554, 5556, …) so emulators
  coexist; else waits (bounded) for a lease to free;
- **re-gates RAM before every boot** — free RAM is re-read immediately before
  each boot and the boot is refused below `EMU_MIN_FREE_RAM_MB` (default 3072 MB)
  even when the cap said there was room. Memory safety is the hard invariant —
  the pool never pushes the host into RAM exhaustion;
- **right-sizes `-memory`** — scales the guest memory flag to RAM headroom,
  clamped to `[EMU_MEMORY_FLOOR_MB, EMU_MEMORY_CEILING_MB]` (2048–4096 MB);
- **reclaims stale leases** — a lease whose owner pid is dead AND whose serial is
  gone from `adb devices` is reclaimed automatically.
Every threshold is env-overridable. `setup-ar-emulator.sh --check` reports pool
state (running count, computed cap, free RAM, active leases). The QA scripts
(`device-qa.sh`, `qa-android-demos.sh`, `ar-replay-qa.sh`) pin `ANDROID_SERIAL`
to the leased emulator so the right device is targeted when the pool has several.

`--check` now also reports host free RAM and whether a running emulator would be
reused. This is why parallel Claude Code sessions running device-QA on the same
RAM-constrained Mac no longer contend for emulator resources.

## Self-hosted macOS runner (opt-in)

GitHub-hosted `macos-15` runners cost ~10x ubuntu per-minute and have no KVM.
SceneView ships **6 jobs on `macos-15`** (`ios.yml`, `bridge-ios-compile.yml`,
`rn-ios-compile.yml`, `app-store.yml` × 2, `render-tests.yml`). The iOS Maestro
device-QA leg (#1601) is CI-wired since #2833 — nightly via `device-qa.yml`,
routed to the self-hosted `sceneview-mac` runner when its heartbeat is fresh
(see the "iOS leg status" note under "Device QA" above). The self-hosted
runner is what makes that leg affordable per-run.

Inspired by [Zach Rattner's M4 Mac cluster
playbook](https://zachrattner.com/projects/m4-mac-cluster) (8 Mac minis, $35k/yr
saved vs GCP, 4-min builds → 40s) — SceneView's scale doesn't justify a
cluster, but a single self-hosted Mac with **transparent fallback** is a
strict win.

### Install

```bash
brew install gh
gh auth login --scopes "repo,workflow"   # PAT needs Variables:write
bash .claude/scripts/setup-self-hosted-runner.sh
bash .claude/scripts/setup-self-hosted-runner.sh --check
```

The installer (a) downloads `actions/runner` for `osx-arm64`/`osx-x64`
into `~/sceneview-runner/` (deliberately *outside* `~/Library/Application
Support/` — that path contains a space, and the runner's generated step
scripts get invoked as `/bin/bash -e <path>` which splits on space and
fails with `No such file or directory`; v2 hit exactly this on the
pilot bridge-ios-compile run id 26418464635), (b) registers it with
label `sceneview-mac`, (c) writes a user LaunchAgent plist directly
and `launchctl bootstrap`s it (the v1 attempt to delegate to
`actions/runner`'s `svc.sh` was a dead end — `svc.sh` shells out to
the deprecated `launchctl load` which fails with `Input/output error`
on macOS 11+, see actions/runner issue 1424).
The plist uses `KeepAlive=true` so the runner survives reboots, login,
sleep/wake, and the runner's own auto-update cycle (the runner exits
to install a new version, launchd restarts it, new version takes over —
verified working). (d) installs a second launchd heartbeat plist that
fires `runner-heartbeat.sh` every 300s. The heartbeat pings
`/repos/.../actions/runners` to confirm the runner is *actually*
online, then updates two repo variables: `SELF_HOSTED_MACOS_ONLINE`
(`"true"`/`"false"`) and `SELF_HOSTED_MACOS_LAST_SEEN` (ISO 8601 UTC).

### Opt a workflow in — single line

Workflows route to self-hosted only when the heartbeat is fresh, and fall
back to `macos-15` automatically when the Mac is asleep, off, or the runner
process is dead (heartbeat sets `ONLINE=false` if `runner.status != "online"`):

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    # Was:  runs-on: macos-15
    runs-on: ${{ vars.SELF_HOSTED_MACOS_ONLINE == 'true' && 'sceneview-mac' || 'macos-15' }}
    steps:
      - ...
```

That's the whole change per workflow. **No composite action, no reusable
workflow, no pre-job** — `runs-on` accepts expressions since GitHub Actions
late-2024. Thomas opts workflows in one at a time as confidence grows; no
existing workflow is modified by this commit.

### Safety net

- Heartbeat refuses to mark `ONLINE=true` when the runner service status is
  anything other than `"online"` (dead service / failed boot / runner mid
  auto-update → workflows route to `macos-15`).
- `KeepAlive=true` on the runner LaunchAgent means a crashed runner is
  re-launched within `ThrottleInterval` (30s). The runner's auto-update
  cycle (exit → launchd restart → new version) is invisible to consumers.
- On `--uninstall`, both LaunchAgents are `launchctl bootout`-ed, any
  rogue `run.sh` is `pkill`-ed, and `ONLINE` is forced to `false` so no
  stale routing survives.
- `--check` prints `.runner` config, both LaunchAgent loaded states with
  `state =` + `last exit code` excerpts, recent heartbeat log, GitHub-side
  runner status (live API call), and both repo variables — single source
  of truth.
- Heartbeat interval (300s) is well under any reasonable workflow queue
  timeout. After `pmset sleepnow` the runner is paused; on wake launchd
  re-validates `KeepAlive` and the runner re-connects to GitHub within a
  few seconds; the heartbeat picks up the offline → online transition at
  the next tick.

## @claude mention bot (GitHub Action)

[`.github/workflows/claude.yml`](.github/workflows/claude.yml) runs the official
[`anthropics/claude-code-action@v1`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action)
whenever a contributor drops **`@claude`** in any of:

- a new issue body or title
- an issue comment
- a PR review or PR review comment

Claude reads the repo (full git history), the issue/PR context, and replies in
place — proposing a fix, opening a PR, or answering questions. Open-source
contributors benefit too; they don't need an Anthropic account.

**Auth — OAuth via Claude Max** (no per-call API spend). Generate the token
once on a logged-in machine and push it to the repo secret:

```bash
claude setup-token                                                    # outputs an OAuth token
gh secret set CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN -R sceneview/sceneview -b "<token>"
```

The token is long-lived; rotate via the same flow if revoked. Cost is on
Thomas's Max quota; gate every fire with an explicit `@claude` mention so
Dependabot etc. never trigger it. Concurrency is keyed per issue/PR — a second
mention cancels a still-running earlier reply.

## Documentation drift (docs ↔ API) — two-tier policy

SceneView is AI-first: the prose docs (`llms.txt`, KDoc, `docs/docs/*`,
`samples/recipes/*`) are the surface an AI reads to generate user code, so
stale docs make an AI emit stale code. Keeping them in sync is enforced at
**two complementary tiers** — neither alone is enough:

1. **Per-PR — advisory, deterministic, cheap.** `check-doc-drift.sh` runs in
   `ci.yml` → `repo-hygiene` and WARNs (in the job step summary) when a PR
   changed a public-API source file *and* added/removed/retyped a public
   declaration without touching the relevant doc surface. **Non-blocking by
   design**: it is a heuristic, and blocking a heuristic guarantees false
   positives that erode trust (consistent with the repo's advisory-first
   stance on flaky device-QA legs). It reminds the author; it never freezes
   the PR. `/document` covers the KDoc half on demand.
2. **Weekly — deep, agent-driven, safe.** [`doc-audit.yml`](.github/workflows/doc-audit.yml)
   fires every Monday 07:17 UTC (and `workflow_dispatch`). It seeds an Opus
   agent with `check-doc-drift.sh --audit` (a repo-wide candidate-drift
   worklist) plus the week's `git log`, the agent reasons over the four
   surfaces against the *current* API, and opens a **DRAFT** PR with concrete
   doc patches (or a single de-duplicated tracking issue when a patch is not
   safe). Draft + human review means a wrong prose patch can never land
   silently — this is where the "auto-fix" power lives, not on every PR.

Alongside the two heuristic tiers, one surface gets a **deterministic,
blocking gate**: `gpt/knowledge-*.md` is GENERATED from `llms.txt` by
`tools/generate-gpt-knowledge.js`, and `ci.yml` → `repo-hygiene` fails when
the committed files drift (`--check`). Generated files can be gated hard
because there is no false-positive risk — never hand-edit them;
`sync-versions.sh --fix` regenerates them on every version bump (#2724).

Why not block per-PR or auto-fix per-PR? Blocking frustrates internal-only
refactors that get mis-classified; per-PR auto-fix is costly on every PR and a
green "bot fixed docs" check invites rubber-stamping a subtly-wrong prose
patch. The weekly draft-PR concentrates the cost and keeps a human in the loop.

## Changelog entries

**Changelog entries go in `changelog.d/`, not `CHANGELOG.md`.** Each PR adds one
fragment file `changelog.d/<issue-or-pr>-<slug>.md` with its release-note
bullet(s) and a `<!-- category: Fixed -->` tag (Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed/
Tests/Docs). Distinct filenames mean parallel PRs never conflict on the
changelog. At release time `bash .claude/scripts/collate-changelog.sh X.Y.Z`
collates every fragment into a new `## vX.Y.Z` section and deletes them. Never
hand-edit the `## Unreleased` anchor — it is kept empty for backward-compat.
See [`changelog.d/README.md`](changelog.d/README.md).

## Version Location Map

**Source of truth:** `gradle.properties` -> `VERSION_NAME=X.Y.Z`

Every file below MUST be updated when bumping the version. Use `/version-bump` or `bash .claude/scripts/sync-versions.sh --fix`.

| Category | File | Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| **Android** | `gradle.properties` (root) | `VERSION_NAME=X.Y.Z` |
| | `sceneview/gradle.properties` | `VERSION_NAME=X.Y.Z` |
| | `arsceneview/gradle.properties` | `VERSION_NAME=X.Y.Z` |
| | `sceneview-core/gradle.properties` | `VERSION_NAME=X.Y.Z` |
| **npm** | `sceneview-web/package.json` | `"version": "X.Y.Z"` |
| | `react-native/react-native-sceneview/package.json` | `"version": "X.Y.Z"` |
| **Flutter** | `flutter/sceneview_flutter/pubspec.yaml` | `version: X.Y.Z` |
| | `flutter/.../android/build.gradle` | `version 'X.Y.Z'` |
| | `flutter/.../ios/flutter_sceneview.podspec` | `s.version = 'X.Y.Z'` |
| **Docs** | `llms.txt` | `io.github.sceneview:sceneview:X.Y.Z` |
| | `README.md` | install snippets |
| | `CLAUDE.md` | code examples section |
| | `docs/docs/index.md` | install snippets |
| | `docs/docs/quickstart.md` | dependency snippets |
| | `docs/docs/llms-full.txt` | artifact versions |
| | `docs/docs/cheatsheet.md` | install snippets |
| | `docs/docs/platforms.md` | install line |
| | `docs/docs/android-xr.md` | install snippets |
| | `docs/docs/migration.md` | "upgrade to" version |
| | `gpt/knowledge-*.md` (×4) | GENERATED from `llms.txt` — `node tools/generate-gpt-knowledge.js`, never hand-edit; `sync-versions.sh --fix` regenerates (#2724) |
| **Website** | `website-static/index.html` | softwareVersion, badge, code |
| | `sceneview.github.io/index.html` | deployed version (separate repo) |
| **Samples** | `samples/android-demo/build.gradle` | versionName default |
| | `samples/ios-demo/SceneViewDemo.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` | `MARKETING_VERSION = X.Y.Z` (iOS + macOS App Store marketing version — the `SceneViewDemo` app target, both Debug & Release configs; the test target's `1.0` is a placeholder, leave it) |
| | `sceneview/Module.md` | version ref |
| **Swift** | `SceneViewSwift/` uses git tag `vX.Y.Z` | not a file version |

> The `io.github.sceneview:(ar)sceneview:X.Y.Z` lines in

**Automation:**
- `bash .claude/scripts/sync-versions.sh` — checks all 30+ locations
- `bash .claude/scripts/sync-versions.sh --fix` — auto-fixes mismatches
- Claude Code plugin marketplace lives in [`sceneview/claude-marketplace`](https://github.com/sceneview/claude-marketplace) — run `bash scripts/sync-plugin-versions.sh` from THAT repo
- `bash .claude/scripts/quality-gate.sh` — full pre-push quality gate
- `bash .claude/scripts/cross-platform-check.sh` — API parity across platforms
- `bash .claude/scripts/release-checklist.sh` — pre-release validation

## Session continuity

> **Where are we right now? → [`.claude/STATE.md`](.claude/STATE.md).**
> That gitignored file is the single live source of truth: `NOW` (released version ·
> what just shipped · what's broken), the `IN-FLIGHT` claim ledger, `NEXT` (<=6 issue
> links), and the `BOOTSTRAP` commands a fresh session runs (<2 min). **CLAUDE.md carries
> zero session state** — never add a "Current state" block here again. Done items move to
> `.claude/handoff.md`; the backlog lives in GitHub issues.

> **How do we work? → [`.claude/workflows/README.md`](.claude/workflows/README.md).**
> The canonical methodology (v2): principles, the unified lifecycle, the 5 tooling layers,
> the parallelism model, autonomy boundaries, quality gates, the saved-workflow index, and
> the claim protocol (`.claude/scripts/claim.sh`) that kills the #2300 dup-implementation race.

### Latest release: see `gradle.properties`

**The source-of-truth version is always `VERSION_NAME` in the root `gradle.properties`** —
read that file, never hardcode a version. Treat it as the latest published version across
all surfaces (Maven Central, npm `sceneview-web`, SPM tag `vX.Y.Z`, web CDN);
`gradle.properties` is authoritative if anything disagrees. `/store-status` verifies the
REAL live versions (CI-green != live).

### Older session logs

Chronological history (the "why did we do X") lives in `.claude/handoff.md` (gitignored,
append-only, rotated to `.claude/handoff-archive/YYYY-QN.md` at 400 lines). `git log` / PR
descriptions are the permanent record; durable cross-session *rules* live in agent memory
(`MEMORY.md` index). Run `/handoff` at session end to reconcile STATE.md -> handoff, and
`/sync-check` before a PR / at session end (never claim "everything is good" without it).

---

## Long-running session rules

Based on [Anthropic harness design for long-running apps](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/harness-design-long-running-apps).

### Context management
- **Read `.claude/handoff.md` at session start** — structured handoff artifact
- **Update `.claude/handoff.md` at session end** — what was done, decisions, next steps
- **Context resets > compaction** — when context gets long, start a fresh session with handoff
- **Don't prematurely wrap up** — if approaching context limits, hand off cleanly instead

### Separate generator from evaluator
- **Never self-evaluate** — run `/review --score` (independent evaluator) as a separate step
- Evaluators should be skeptical; generators should be creative
- If any evaluation criterion scores 1-2/5, it's BLOCKING — fix before pushing

### Sprint contracts
- Before starting a feature chunk, define **what "done" looks like**
- Use the sprint contract template in `.claude/handoff.md`
- Prevents scope creep and ensures alignment

### Decomposition
- **One feature at a time** — break complex work into discrete chunks
- Each chunk should compile, test, and be commitable independently
- Don't attempt end-to-end execution of large features in one go

### Criteria-driven quality
- Use measurable criteria (compile? tests pass? review checklist?)
- Weight criteria: Safety (3x) > Correctness (3x) > API consistency (2x) > Completeness (2x) > Minimality (1x)
- Explicit > vague — "tests pass" beats "looks good"

### Complexity hygiene
- Every harness component encodes an assumption about model limitations
- Regularly stress-test: does this hook/check still add value?
- Remove scaffolding that newer model capabilities make unnecessary

### Available evaluator commands
| Command | Role |
|---|---|
| `/review` | Independent review — `low` checklist · `high` adversarial triptych · `--score` weighted eval · `--coverage` test gaps (absorbs the former `/evaluate` + `/test`) |
| `/sync-check` | Repo + published-artifact sync (`--published-only` = the former `/publish-check`) |
| `/store-status` | Real live store / Maven / npm versions (CI-green != live) |
| `/contribute` | Full contribution workflow |
| `/version-bump` | Coordinated version update across all platforms |
| `/release` | Full release lifecycle (bump, changelog, tag, publish) |
| `/maintain` | Daily maintenance sweep (CI, issues, deps, quality) |
| `/handoff` | End-of-session continuity (reconcile STATE.md -> handoff) |

Multi-agent **saved workflows** (`.claude/workflows/`, run via the Workflow tool):
`triptych`, `fix-issue-batch`, `audit-sweep`, `release-checkpoint`, `device-qa-orchestrate`,
`doc-drift-fix`, `store-status`, `phase2-reconcile`. See `.claude/workflows/README.md`.

## Automation ecosystem

### Hooks (settings.json)

Hooks trigger automatically on specific Claude Code actions:

| Trigger | When | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-commit version check | `git commit` | Blocks if VERSION_NAME mismatches across modules |
| Post-edit gradle.properties | Any gradle.properties edit | Reminds to update ALL version locations |
| Post-edit Android API | Edit in `sceneview/src/` | Reminds to check SceneViewSwift + llms.txt |
| Post-edit Swift API | Edit in `SceneViewSwift/Sources/` | Reminds to check Android + llms.txt |
| Post-push reminder | `git push` | Reminds to update CLAUDE.md and website |

### Scripts (.claude/scripts/)

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `sync-versions.sh` | Scan ALL version declarations, report/fix mismatches (the single source of truth for the version-location list) |
| `claim.sh` | Atomic issue-claim registry that kills the #2300 dup-implementation race. Primary lock = GitHub `in-progress` label (cross-host); local mirror = the `STATE.md` IN-FLIGHT ledger. `<issue#>` / `--check` / `--release` / `--list` / `--force`. macOS-safe (sleepless `mkdir` lock, no `flock`) |
| `check-saved-workflows.sh` | Static validator for the `.claude/workflows/*.js` saved workflows (async-wrapped `node --check` + meta block + resume-safety). Distinct from `check-workflow-scripts.sh`, which validates the CI YAML |
| `cross-platform-check.sh` | Compare Android vs iOS vs Web API surface, report gaps |
| `release-checklist.sh` | Pre-release validation (versions, changelog, tests, etc.). Section 16 runs `store-preflight.sh` (advisory) |
| `store-preflight.sh` | Read-only App Store Connect preflight (#2612 P1) — detects the human-only store blockers that silently 403 a deploy: an expired Apple agreement (`REQUIRED_AGREEMENTS_MISSING_OR_EXPIRED` canary), an App Review rejection, cert/profile expiry (< `CERT_EXPIRY_WARN_DAYS`, default 30), and (since #2731) an open never-submitted reviewSubmission (`READY_FOR_REVIEW`/`UNRESOLVED_ISSUES`) — the silent-submission signature the IOS-scoped version-state probe alone can't see. Signs the ASC ES256 JWT with openssl only; reuses `app-store.yml`'s ASC secrets (no new scope); SKIPs honestly without creds. Advisory-first — a blocker hard-blocks only under `GATE_HARD=1`. Wired into `release-checklist.sh` §16, the `/store-status` command doc (probe-set wiring is a P1 follow-up), and a daily `maintenance.yml` job. Self-tested by `test-store-preflight.sh` (in `repo-hygiene`) |
| `store-sync/play_listing.py` | Play listing sync/diff as code (#2612 P2) — the single code path for `play-store.yml`'s `sync-listing` job (`--apply`) and local read-only drift diffs (`--dry-run` default: listing text + per-image SHA-256 vs the live store, probe edit abandoned). SKIPs honestly without creds. Self-tested by `test-store-sync.sh` (repo-hygiene) |
| `store-sync/asc_listing.py` | App Store listing drift diff + screenshot upload (#2612 P2). `--dry-run` (default, read-only) diffs live ASC text fields + screenshot `sourceFileChecksum` against `samples/ios-demo/distribution/app-store/` + `appstore-screenshots/`; `--apply-screenshots` uploads the repo screenshots (reserve → chunked PUT → commit `uploaded:true` + MD5) to the **editable** version, replacing each display-type set (delete-then-upload; a failed delete is fatal *before* any upload, so a half-replaced set can't happen). Live order is *expected* to follow repo filename order — Apple does not promise creation order, so the script PROBES it after upload and warns instead of asserting. Never creates a version — SKIPs honestly when none is editable, so `app-store.yml`'s repaired submit step (#2731) stays untouched. Listing TEXT stays owned by that step. CI caller = its OWN workflow `app-store-screenshots.yml` (ubuntu, dispatch-only, no Xcode) — deliberately NOT a job in `app-store.yml`, whose `deploy-ios`/`deploy-macos` are gated only on `*_ready`, so a screenshot dispatch there would also build and upload a TestFlight build (caught in PR #2781 review). Flag abbreviations are disabled on both store-sync scripts: `--apply` must not resolve into an upload. Same ASC env aliases as `store-preflight.sh`. **`--dry-run` is also the daily read-only `maintenance.yml` `asc-listing-drift` job** (#2612 P2 Phase C step 0, sibling of `store-preflight`) — the first CI caller of the ASC read-only path. It prints a `sourceFileChecksum` **provenance verdict** (`confirmed`/`unattested-match`/`md5-shaped`/`absent`/`other`/…): the MD5 keying the screenshot diff rests on is *measured, not assumed* (true by construction for anything this script uploaded — Apple echoes what we declare — so only console-sourced live sets are an honest sample). A repo-MD5 match therefore reports `unattested-match`, **not** `confirmed`, unless the operator attests provenance with `--screenshots-are-console-sourced` (which covers the draft too, and names its own source in the log so an inherited env var can't attest invisibly); without that gate a single `app-store-screenshots.yml` dispatch would have made the verdict permanently green on a tautology (caught in PR #2811 review). The probe also samples the **editable draft**'s screenshot sets and stamps every set with the version it was read from (`APP_IPHONE_67 @4.23.0`, `… @draft 4.24.0`), because a console upload lands on the draft — and that draft keeps its screenshots when it ships, so a set being live proves nothing about who uploaded it. Phase C's drift gate (release-checklist §17 + drift-dedup issue) stays **unwired** until the verdict reads `confirmed` |
| `lib/android-cli.sh` | Shared helpers for Google's `android` CLI (screenshot, layout, install+launch) with `adb` fallback |
| `setup-ar-emulator.sh` | Bootstrap a reusable ARCore-ready `Pixel_7a` emulator (virtualscene camera, 4 GB RAM, host GPU, ARCore APK). Idempotent — `--check` (read-only, reports pool + snapshot state + camera-id topology, #2754), `--clean` (wipe+recreate), `--seed-snapshot` (seed the golden `qa-clean` boot snapshot), `--no-snapshot` (force cold boot), `--rosetta` (provision/boot the separate x86_64-under-Rosetta AR rig on reserved port 5584 — ⛔ **measured NOT to deliver live-camera AR**: no camera HAL id `0`, ARCore install kills `system_server`, nothing renders; kept as a reproducible probe, #2758). RAM-budgeted adaptive emulator pool (#1647 → #1654): leases a free running emulator, or boots a new one on a distinct `-port` when the live RAM-budgeted cap has room and free RAM clears the hard safety gate, or waits for a lease to free. Boot snapshots (#1672): once seeded, the base-port emulator cold-boots from the immutable `qa-clean` snapshot — faster and deterministic, and fixes the userdata storage-degradation bug. **Use this for routine QA — never QA on a personal device.** |
| `lib/emulator-select.sh` | Sourced helper for `setup-ar-emulator.sh` / `device-qa.sh` / `qa-android-demos.sh` — RAM monitoring (`vm_stat`/`/proc/meminfo`), RAM-budgeted pool-cap computation, a per-emulator lease registry, RAM-scaled `-memory`, multi-port boot, and stale-lease reclaim. The adaptive pool runs as many emulators as live host RAM safely allows (floor 1, `EMU_POOL_MAX` ceiling), superseding #1647's strict-single design (#1654). |
| `qa-android-demos.sh` | QA loop over every demo — uses `android layout`/`screen capture` for the UI dump and screenshots |
| `capture-play-store-screenshots.sh` | Play Store screenshot capture — `android screen capture` (no LF/CRLF corruption) |
| `visual-check.sh` | Before/after baseline capture — Android via `android` CLI, iOS via `xcrun simctl` |
| `android-env-check.sh` | Sanity check for the Android dev env — `--fix` installs the CLI + SceneView skill |
| `install-sceneview-skill.sh` | Copies `agents/sceneview/` (Android skill) to `~/.android/cli/skills/xr/sceneview/` |
| `install-sceneview-ios-skill.sh` | Copies `agents/sceneview-ios/` (Apple skill) to `~/.android/cli/skills/xr/sceneview-ios/` |
| `install-sceneview-web-skill.sh` | Copies `agents/sceneview-web/` (Web skill) to `~/.android/cli/skills/xr/sceneview-web/` |
| `check-sceneview-skill.sh` | Verifies all three `agents/sceneview*/` skills (API identifiers, demo refs, frontmatter) are in sync with the library source. Runs in `quality-gate.sh`, `pr-check.yml`, and daily via `maintenance.yml` |
| `check-doc-drift.sh` | Flags when a public-API change is not mirrored in the docs (llms.txt / KDoc / `docs/docs/*` / recipes). **Diff mode** (default) = per-PR ADVISORY WARN, runs in `ci.yml` → `repo-hygiene`; never blocks (heuristic → would false-positive). **`--audit` mode** = repo-wide candidate-drift worklist consumed by the weekly `doc-audit.yml` agent. `--fail` opts into a non-zero exit. Self-tested by `test-check-doc-drift.sh` (also in `repo-hygiene`). |
| `worktree-auto-prune.sh` | Safe GC for `.claude/worktrees/*` — removes worktrees whose branch is merged (`--dry-run`, `--yes`, `--keep <path>`). Never touches dirty or unmerged trees |
| `cleanup-branches-worktrees.sh` | One-shot GC for stale `claude/*` branches **and** worktrees: deletes merged local + remote branches (single `git push --delete`, no bot-burst) and delegates worktree pruning to `worktree-auto-prune.sh`. Defaults to dry-run; `--yes` to act, `--keep <branch\|path>`, `--no-worktrees`. Current-branch / unmerged / open-PR guarded. Runs daily in `maintenance.yml` |

| sceneview-mcp | npm | `npm view sceneview-mcp version` |
| sceneview-web | npm | `npm view sceneview-web version` |
| SceneViewSwift | SPM (git tags) | `git tag -l 'v*'` |
| GitHub Release | GitHub | `gh release list` |
| Website | GitHub Pages | sceneview.github.io |

### Quality gates (must pass before any push to main)

1. All versions aligned (run `sync-versions.sh`)
2. No lint errors in library modules
3. Unit tests pass (`./gradlew :sceneview-core:allTests`)
4. MCP tests pass (`cd mcp && npm test`)
5. llms.txt matches current public API
6. CLAUDE.md session state is current
7. No model-viewer or Three.js in website code
8. No external CDN dependencies in website
9. Public-API ABI matches the committed `.api` dumps (`./gradlew apiCheck` — intentional changes re-run `apiDump` and commit the diff)

## Cross-platform strategy

### Architecture: native renderer per platform

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              sceneview-core (KMP)            │
│     math, collision, geometry, animations    │
│         commonMain → XCFramework             │
└──────────┬──────────────────┬───────────────┘
           │                  │

    │  sceneview  │   │SceneViewSwift│
    │  (Android)  │   │   (Apple)    │
    │  Filament   │   │  RealityKit  │
    └──────┬──────┘   └──────┬──────┘
           │                  │
     Compose UI        SwiftUI (native)
                       Flutter (PlatformView)
                       React Native (Fabric)
                       KMP Compose (UIKitView)
```

**Key decision:** KMP shares **logic** (math, collision, geometry, animations), not **rendering**.
Each platform uses its native renderer: Filament on Android, RealityKit on Apple.

Rationale:
- RealityKit is the only path to visionOS spatial computing
- Swift Package integration (1 line SPM) vs KMP XCFramework (opaque binary, poor DX)
- SceneViewSwift is consumable by any iOS framework (Flutter, React Native, KMP Compose)
- No Filament dependency on Apple = smaller binary, native debugging, native tooling

### Supported platforms

| Platform | Renderer | Framework | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Android | Filament | Jetpack Compose | Stable (v3.3.0) |
| Android TV | Filament | Compose TV | Alpha (sample app) |
| Android XR | Jetpack XR SceneCore | Compose XR | Planned |
| iOS | RealityKit | SwiftUI | Alpha (v3.3.0) |
| macOS | RealityKit | SwiftUI | Alpha (v3.3.0, in Package.swift) |
| visionOS | RealityKit | SwiftUI | Alpha (v3.3.0, in Package.swift) |
| Web | Filament.js (WASM) | Kotlin/JS | Alpha (sceneview-web + WebXR) |
| Desktop | Wireframe placeholder (not SceneView) | Compose Desktop | Placeholder (Filament JNI not available) |
| Flutter | Filament / RealityKit | PlatformView | Alpha (bridge implemented) |
| React Native | Filament / RealityKit | Fabric | Alpha (bridge implemented) |

### KMP core role

`sceneview-core/` targets `android`, `iosArm64`, `iosSimulatorArm64`, `iosX64` with shared:
- Collision system (Ray, Box, Sphere, Intersections)
- Triangulation (Earcut, Delaunator)
- Geometry generation (Cube, Sphere, Cylinder, Plane, Path, Line, Shape)
- Animation (Spring, Property, Interpolation, SmoothTransform)
- Physics simulation
- Scene graph, math utilities, logging

SceneViewSwift can consume this as an XCFramework for shared algorithms,
while keeping RealityKit as the rendering backend.

### Cross-framework iOS consumption

| Framework | Integration method |
|---|---|
| Swift native | `import SceneViewSwift` via SPM |
| Flutter | Plugin with `PlatformView` wrapping `SceneView`/`ARSceneView` |
| React Native | Turbo Module / Fabric component bridging to SceneViewSwift |
| KMP Compose | `UIKitView` in Compose iOS wrapping the underlying UIView |

### Phased plan (revised)

| Phase | Scope | Complexity |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — SceneViewSwift stabilization | Complete 3D+AR API, add macOS target, tests, docs | Medium |
| 2 — KMP core consumption | Build XCFramework from sceneview-core, integrate into SceneViewSwift | Medium |
| 3 — Cross-framework bridges | Flutter plugin, React Native module | Medium |
| 4 — visionOS spatial | Immersive spaces, hand tracking, spatial anchors | High |
| 5 — Docs & website | Update all docs/README/site for multi-platform (iOS, macOS, visionOS) | Low |
