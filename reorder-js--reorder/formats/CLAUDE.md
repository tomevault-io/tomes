# Reorder agent guidelines

This file defines how coding agents should work in the official `reorder` repository.

## Always

- Write all code, comments, specs, markdown files, lessons, and commit messages in English only, regardless of the language used in the chat.
- **When the user approves changes after code review, propose a commit message in the Conventional Commits format `type(scope): description` (e.g., `feat(ai): add create-spec skill`, `fix(dunning): resolve retry loop`). Wait for explicit user approval of the commit message before committing and pushing changes to the repository.**
- Identify which Reorder area you are changing and check the Task Router below before starting.
- Read the relevant runtime documentation in `docs/` before reading implementation files.
- Refer to `docs/README.md` for plugin overview, current scope, and implemented domains.
- Enter plan mode for non-trivial tasks (3+ steps or architectural decisions) and use the `create-spec` skill to draft a specification in `.agents/specs/` before writing code.
- Check `.agents/lessons.md` at the start of the session to avoid repeating past mistakes.
- After fixing any bug or resolving a complex issue, update `.agents/lessons.md` with the lesson learned and a rule to prevent it in the future.
- Use Medusa agentic skills whenever they fit the task.
- After successfully pushing code to GitHub, **always** ask the user if the public Mintlify documentation needs to be updated. If yes, execute the `sync-docs` skill.
- Keep changes minimal and local to the affected area.
- Follow Medusa conventions (file-based routing with `route.ts`, Awilix resolve, custom modules under `src/modules/<domain>/`, models in `models/`, migrations in `migrations/`, workflows in `src/workflows/`, jobs in `src/jobs/`).
- Write integration tests for new features (preferring HTTP integration tests in `integration-tests/http/`). Keep them self-contained.
- If behavior changes, update the matching runtime documentation in `docs/`.

## Ask First

- Ask and obtain explicit confirmation before executing destructive data wipe scripts (e.g., `wipe-test-data`).
- Ask before changing branch/PR automation, pipeline labels, QA flows, or release behaviors.
- Ask before making changes that span multiple domains or modules without an existing spec.
- Ask before adding new external dependencies to `package.json`.
- Ask before modifying database models or introducing complex schema migrations.

## Never

- Never use `any` in TypeScript code. Prefer descriptive, strict domain types.
- Never write business rules directly in route handlers or React components; keep them in workflows or service layers.
- Never bypass mutation guards or domain boundaries (do not introduce unnecessary cross-domain coupling).
- Never modify generated files by hand.
- Never refactor unrelated files while fixing a local issue.
- Never document intended future behavior; only document stable, implemented behavior.

## Validation Commands

Run the smallest relevant validation command for your changes:

```bash
yarn build
yarn test:integration:http
yarn test:integration:modules
yarn test:e2e                                      # Requires running Medusa backend (ADMIN_BASE_URL)
```

## Task router

Match the task to all relevant rows before researching or coding.

| Module or model changes | `src/modules/README.md`, then matching architecture doc |
| Jobs and scheduled processing | matching architecture doc and matching testing doc |

## Repository map

Important areas:

- `src/modules/` domain modules and persistence
- `src/workflows/` business mutations and orchestration
- `src/api/admin/` Admin API routes
- `src/api/store/` Store API routes
- `src/admin/` Admin dashboard routes, widgets, types, and client helpers
- `src/jobs/` scheduled processing
- `src/links/` Medusa entity links
- `integration-tests/` integration coverage
- `e2e/` Playwright E2E browser tests, auth setup, and Page Object Models (`e2e/pages/`)
- `docs/` runtime documentation

## Architecture rules

- Keep business rules in workflows or module services, not in route handlers or React components.
- Route handlers should validate input, resolve dependencies from `req.scope`, call workflows or services, and return DTOs.
- Keep domain ownership clear:
  - `subscription`
  - `plan-offer`
  - `renewal`
  - `dunning`
  - `cancellation`
  - `activity-log`
  - `analytics`
  - `settings`
- Reuse existing workflow patterns for state-changing operations.
- Preserve snapshot-based read models where the docs describe them.
- Keep store responses separate from Admin DTOs.
- Do not introduce unnecessary cross-domain coupling when an existing workflow or link boundary already exists.

## Medusa conventions

- File-based routes must use `route.ts`.
- Use `req.scope.resolve(...)` for Medusa services and registered resources.
- Keep custom modules under `src/modules/<domain>/`.
- Put module models under `models/`, migrations under `migrations/`, and shared helpers under `utils/` or `types/`.
- Keep workflows in `src/workflows/` and steps in `src/workflows/steps/`.
- Scheduled jobs belong in `src/jobs/`.
- Admin extensions belong in `src/admin/`.

## Coding rules

- Prefer existing domain types and validators.
- Avoid `any`.
- Keep naming consistent with existing domains, DTOs, and route names.
- Use explicit, descriptive names.
- Prefer small helpers over deeply nested inline logic.
- Follow existing response shapes for each area.
- Do not refactor unrelated files while fixing a local issue.

## Documentation rules

- If behavior changes, update the matching runtime docs in `docs/`.
- Document implemented behavior, not intended future behavior.
- Use repository terminology consistently:
  - `subscription`
  - `plan`
  - `offer`
  - `renewal cycle`
  - `dunning case`
  - `cancellation case`
  - `activity log`

## Testing rules

- Run focused tests for the area you changed whenever possible.
- Prefer existing integration test patterns in `integration-tests/http/`.
- Add or update tests when changing:
  - API contracts
  - workflow behavior
  - scheduler logic
  - cross-domain state transitions
- Keep tests self-contained. Do not depend on pre-seeded data.
- For Admin UI browser automation, write Playwright tests under `e2e/` using the Page Object Model (POM) pattern in `e2e/pages/`.
- Keep E2E tests self-contained and data-independent: seed required test records (e.g. products, variants) via Medusa API in `beforeEach` hooks instead of relying on manual database state.
- In UI mutation tests, assert both frontend feedback (toasts, modal closing, DataTable visibility) and intercept outgoing API requests (`waitForResponse`) to validate the payload against the backend contract.
- If you change documented behavior, verify implementation and docs remain aligned.
