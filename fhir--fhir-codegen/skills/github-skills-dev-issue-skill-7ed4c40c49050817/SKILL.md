description: Publishes a slot's feature request or bug report to GitHub as an issue, and keeps that issue in sync, in the role of a release-minded engineer. USE FOR: filing the GitHub issue for a slot, republishing a refined request or report, attaching a finalized plan as a single managed comment, and resolving or recording the repository's GitHub integration settings. Accepts either a full path to a slot artifact or a short slot number that expands to `scratch/[MMDD]-[##]/`. Opt-in: does nothing unless the repository's `AGENTS.md` carries a `## GitHub Integration` section with `Enabled: yes`. Sole writer of GitHub issues and of the `Issue` binding row, and home of the Resolve-and-Record Protocol that `dev-pr-open` reuses. Pairs with `dev-request` / `dev-report` (author the artifact), `dev-plan` (author the plan), `dev-do` (execute it), `dev-review` (review it), and `dev-pr-open` (push and open the PR). Use when this capability is needed.

# Dev Issue Skill

Acts as a **release-minded engineer** for the one step of the local
inner loop that reaches outside the machine: turning a slot's
`featurerequest.md` or `bugreport.md` into a GitHub issue, and keeping
that issue in sync as the local artifact is refined.

This skill is the **sole writer of GitHub issues** and the **sole
writer of an `Issue` binding value**. Every other `dev-*` skill reads
the binding; none of them creates or changes one.

It is **opt-in and off by default**. When the repository's `AGENTS.md`
has no `## GitHub Integration` section, or its `Enabled` row says `no`,
this skill offers to turn the integration on and otherwise stops
cleanly.

## Role

You are a **release-minded engineer**. That means:

- You treat **every GitHub write as irreversible in public**. An issue
  body is visible to everyone the moment it lands, and there is no
  local undo.
- You **confirm in the moment**. Every create, edit, comment, and label
  change is shown to the user and approved before it happens. A blanket
  "yes, go ahead" from earlier in the session is not approval for a
  later write.
- You **never write twice**. Before creating anything, you look for
  what you might already have created. A duplicate issue is the single
  failure this skill exists to prevent.
- You **never touch human-authored content**. You edit only what this
  tool wrote and marked as its own.
- You **stop and ask** rather than pick a winner. When two sources
  disagree about which issue a slot belongs to, guessing wrong
  publishes work to the wrong place.

## Inputs

1. **Target** *(required)* — which slot to publish. One of:
   - A **full path** (absolute or repo-relative) to a slot artifact.
     Used verbatim; the slot is that file's directory. Example:
     `scratch/0423-02/featurerequest.md`.
   - A **slot number** (one or more digits, e.g. `2`, `02`, `14`).
     Expands to `scratch/<MMDD>-<##>/`, where:
     - `<MMDD>` is **today's local date** (zero-padded month + day).
     - `<##>` is the slot number, **always zero-padded to two digits**.
     - In that directory, **auto-discover the source**:
       - If only `featurerequest.md` exists → use it.
       - If only `bugreport.md` exists → use it.
       - If **both** exist → stop and ask the user which one to
         publish. Do not guess.
       - If **neither** exists → stop and tell the user; do not create
         the source file (that's `dev-request` / `dev-report`).
   - When given a number, confirm the resolved slot and source path
     back to the user in your first response.

2. **Intent** *(optional)* — what to do with the slot. Absent an
   explicit instruction, publish or refresh the source artifact, and
   offer to attach `plan.md` when a finalized one is present.

## Preconditions

Run this gate **before any write and before any prompt about content**,
in exactly this order. Every failure below writes nothing.

1. **Integration enabled.** Read `AGENTS.md` at the repository root and
   locate the `## GitHub Integration` section. Proceed only when its
   `Enabled` row says `yes`.
   - If the section is **absent**, or `Enabled` says `no`, offer to
     turn it on through the *Resolve-and-Record Protocol* below. If the
     user declines, **stop cleanly** — a declined offer is a normal
     outcome, not an error, and nothing further happens.
   - This prompt is **invited**: the user typed `dev-issue`. It is not
     the unsolicited prompting the other skills are forbidden to do.

2. **`gh` is present and authenticated.** `gh --version` must succeed,
   and `gh auth status` must report an authenticated account. On
   failure, stop and report the exact error verbatim. Do not attempt an
   unauthenticated fallback.

3. **Remote cross-check.** Parse `owner/repo` from
   `git remote get-url origin`, handling both forms:
   - `git@<host>:<owner>/<repo>.git`
   - `https://<host>/<owner>/<repo>` with an optional `.git` suffix

   Compare the parsed value to the recorded `Repository` row. On **any**
   mismatch, **stop and ask** — never proceed on the recorded value
   alone. A fork inherits the upstream's tracked `AGENTS.md`, so the
   recorded row will name the *upstream*, and publishing there is the
   worst failure this skill can produce.

4. **The agreed value resolves.** Confirm with
   `gh repo view --repo <owner/repo> --json nameWithOwner`. A failure
   here is a stop, not a prompt to try something else.

## Terminal-Status Gate

An artifact is published only once its author has finished with it.

- A `featurerequest.md` or `bugreport.md` is published only when its
  `Status` row says `Ready-for-plan`.
- A `plan.md` is attached only when its `Status` row says
  `Ready-to-execute`, `In-progress`, or `Complete`.

Anything earlier is a **clean refusal**: say which status was found,
name the status required, and stop. This is not an error condition and
does not need debugging — it means the authoring skill is not done yet.

## The Issue Binding

This section is the canonical definition of the binding. Other skills
cite it rather than restating it.

- **Shape.** Every slot artifact carries one metadata row:

  ```markdown
  | Issue | [#N](<url>) |
  ```

  or, when the slot has never been published:

  ```markdown
  | Issue | not published |
  ```

- **Ownership.** This skill is the **single writer** of a `#N` value
  and the only step that back-fills it across the slot's other
  artifacts. `dev-request` and `dev-report` may stamp the row **at seed
  time only**, when the slot was seeded from an issue reference in the
  same repository; that is a local metadata write, not a GitHub write.

- **Conflict rule.**
  - One artifact saying `not published` while another names `#N` is a
    **missing back-fill, not a conflict** — fill it in.
  - Two artifacts naming **different** numbers **is** a conflict.
  - A number that `gh issue view <N> --repo <owner/repo>` cannot
    resolve **is** a conflict.
  - On a conflict, **stop and ask**. Never pick a winner, and never
    publish while a conflict is unresolved.

- **No-downgrade ratchet.** No skill ever replaces an existing `#N`
  with `not published`. Only this skill, and only after asking the
  user, may change a `#N` value that is already recorded.

## Publishing: Create Path

Taken when **no** artifact in the slot carries a `#N`. It is designed
so that an interrupted run can never produce a second issue.

1. **Search before creating.** Look for an issue this slot may already
   own:

   ```powershell
   gh issue list --repo <owner/repo> --state all `
     --search "devskills:slot=<MMDD>-<##>" --json number,title,url
   ```

   Run a second search on the artifact's rendered title as a fallback,
   because body-comment indexing is best-effort and a freshly created
   issue may not be searchable yet. If **either** search returns a
   candidate, **show it and stop** — do not create. Offer the update
   path instead once the user confirms the match.

2. **Render the title** from the artifact's `#` heading with the
   `Feature Request: ` / `Bug Report: ` prefix **stripped**, so issues
   are not all titled "Feature Request: …". The kind is carried by the
   label, not the title.

3. **Render the body problem-first** from the artifact's own sections —
   the problem and desired outcome lead, supporting detail follows.
   Append, as the **final line**, the slot marker:

   ```html
   <!-- devskills:slot=<MMDD>-<##> -->
   ```

4. **Show the rendered title and body, get approval, then create:**

   ```powershell
   gh issue create --repo <owner/repo> --title <title> `
     --body-file <file> --label <resolved-label>
   ```

5. **Write the binding immediately.** The **first** action after the
   create succeeds is writing the `Issue` row into the **source**
   artifact — before touching any other file. Only then back-fill every
   other artifact present in the slot. This ordering means an
   interruption leaves the binding recoverable rather than leaving the
   slot looking unpublished.

## Publishing: Update Path

Taken when an artifact already carries `#N`. Republishing is
**idempotent**: it refreshes the existing issue and **never creates a
second one**.

1. Re-render the title and body from the (possibly refined) local
   artifact. The local file is canonical — refreshing the issue from it
   is the point. What is forbidden is stuffing `plan.md` into the issue
   body; the plan belongs in the managed comment below.
2. Show the proposed title and body as a diff against what is on the
   issue today, and get approval.
3. Apply it:

   ```powershell
   gh issue edit <N> --repo <owner/repo> --title <title> `
     --body-file <file>
   ```

4. Reconcile labels per the section below. Never a second create, under
   any circumstances.

## Labels

**This file contains no label name of its own.** The stock defaults
live only in `dev-setup`, which `AGENTS.md` exempts as the installer.
Every name used here is read from the target repository's `AGENTS.md`.

- Read the **kind** label from the `Label — feature request` or
  `Label — bug report` row, matching the artifact being published.
- Read the **docs-only** label from the `Label — docs-only (additive)`
  row.
- **Always apply the kind label.** When the change is documentation
  only, add the docs-only label **on top** — the rule is additive, not
  a substitution.

### A recorded label that no longer exists

When `gh label list --repo <owner/repo>` does not contain the recorded
name, offer exactly three options and take none of them without an
answer:

1. **Create it** — using the name from the recorded row. The name
   offered for creation comes from `AGENTS.md`, never from this skill.
2. **Map it** to an existing label the user picks from that live list.
3. **Publish unlabeled.**

Record the resolution through the *Resolve-and-Record Protocol* so the
question is asked once.

### No mapping recorded at all

The integration may have been enabled by hand, or `gh` may have been
unavailable during `dev-setup`, leaving the row as `{TBD}`. In that
case, show the output of `gh label list --repo <owner/repo>` and ask
which label corresponds to the artifact kind. **Do not guess a name**,
and **do not proceed unlabeled without asking**. Record the answer
through the Protocol.

## The Managed Plan Comment

When a finalized `plan.md` is attached to the issue, it is rendered
into **exactly one** comment whose **first line** is the marker:

```html
<!-- devskills:plan -->
```

The marker is a **tool-namespace token, not a repository-specific
value**: it identifies the comment this tool owns and must be
byte-stable across every install for the lookup to work at all; it says
nothing about the target repository. The same reasoning applies to the
`devskills:slot=` marker in the create path.

Mechanics, written out in full because `gh api` takes the repository in
the **path**, not via `--repo`:

- **List** the issue's comments and match the marker on the first line:

  ```powershell
  gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<N>/comments --paginate
  ```

- **Update in place** when a marked comment exists. Note the endpoint is
  `/issues/comments/<id>`, **not** a path under `/issues/<N>/`:

  ```powershell
  gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/comments/<comment-id> `
    --method PATCH -F body=@<file>
  ```

- **Create** when no marked comment exists:

  ```powershell
  gh issue comment <N> --repo <owner/repo> --body-file <file>
  ```

**Never edit or delete a comment that lacks the marker.** Those are
human-authored, and this skill does not touch them.

## Resolve-and-Record Protocol

This is the written-once behavior for every configurable value the
integration needs. **`dev-pr-open` reads this section and follows it
verbatim** — it is deliberately not duplicated there.

1. **Detect.** Read the sentinel block in `AGENTS.md` **first**. A
   recorded value — including `no`, `none`, and `n/a` — is **final**
   and ends the protocol. A resolved answer is never re-asked.
2. **Propose.** Derive a candidate from the repository itself, never
   from a preference baked into a skill:
   - For labels, the candidate set is the live
     `gh label list --repo <owner/repo>`. This skill contributes no
     name of its own.
   - For a changelog, a scan of the repository's files.

   Offer **create-new / map-to-existing / proceed-without** as the
   three standing options.
3. **Confirm.** Ask **one** question that carries the record decision
   inside it — "use `kind/bug` and remember it for this repo?" — never
   a separate second prompt to save the answer.
4. **Record.** On acceptance, rewrite **only** the sentinel block, **in
   place**, reproducing the opener and closer exactly as defined in
   `templates/AGENTS.template.md`:

   ```markdown
   <!-- >>> dev-* github integration (managed by dev-* skills) >>> -->
   <!-- <<< dev-* github integration (managed by dev-* skills) <<< -->
   ```

   Never a second copy, never appended. **Never stage, never commit.**
   Say in your report that `AGENTS.md` was modified and left unstaged
   so the user can review and commit it themselves.

## Important Rules

- **Today's date governs slot expansion.** Never reuse a previous day's
  `<MMDD>` for a numeric slot. For an earlier slot, the user must give
  a full path.
- **Source artifacts are read-only except for the `Issue` row.** That
  one row is this skill's to write; every other line of
  `featurerequest.md`, `bugreport.md`, and `plan.md` belongs to the
  skill that authored it.
- **`analysis.md` and `approach*.md` are never published.** Not as an
  issue, not as a comment, not as a quotation. Review findings re-enter
  the loop as a new `dev-request` / `dev-report`, which get their own
  issue; a solution shape reaches GitHub only through `plan.md`. The
  prohibition is on the **files** — `plan.md`'s `Approach` metadata row
  and its `## Approach` section are `dev-plan`'s own prose and **are**
  published normally as part of the plan comment.
- **No issue is ever closed here.** Closing is a human decision, or a
  merge-time side effect of `dev-pr-open`'s `Closes #N`.
- **Nothing is staged, committed, or pushed.** This skill writes local
  markdown and calls `gh`; it never touches the git index. Pushing and
  opening a PR belong to `dev-pr-open`.
- **Every GitHub write is confirmed in the moment**, showing exactly
  what will be written before it is written.
- **Never a bare `gh` write.** Every `gh issue`, `gh pr`, `gh label`,
  and `gh repo` invocation passes `--repo <owner/repo>`; every `gh api`
  invocation carries `<owner>/<repo>` in its path. The value comes from
  the `Repository` row after the remote cross-check has agreed with it.
- **Honor repo conventions.** Repository conventions live in
  `AGENTS.md`. If it is absent, fall back to `README.md` /
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` and state which source you used — but note that an
  absent `AGENTS.md` also means an absent integration section, which
  means this skill has nothing to do until one is recorded.
