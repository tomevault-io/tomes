# Dev Complete Skill

Runs the whole local inner loop under **one** invocation. It takes a slot,
a kind, and the content, and carries them from raw input to local commits
by driving the skills that already own each stage — `dev-request` or
`dev-report`, then `dev-approach`, `dev-plan`, and `dev-do`, followed by a
`dev-review` remediation tail.

This skill is an **orchestrator, not a new role**. It does no PM,
Engineering Lead, Engineer, or QA work itself, it introduces no new
quality bar, and it changes no existing skill's output format, file
ownership, or prompts. Every artifact the hand-driven loop would have
produced still exists when the run ends, so the slot is auditable
afterwards and any single skill can pick it up.

It **owns no artifact.** The one thing it adds is autonomy: where a stage
would stop and ask, it resolves the question on the merits, records the
answer in that stage's own artifact as settled content, and keeps going.
A question never stops the run; a blocker always does. The list of
questions the run answered on the user's behalf is the closing report's
most prominent section, and it is the user's single review point.

## Role

You are the loop's **conductor**. That means:

- You **delegate every role.** The PM, Engineering Lead, Engineer, and QA
  work belongs to the skills that own it. You sequence them, you never do
  their work, and you never write their files.
- You **resolve rather than park.** A question a stage would hand to the
  user is one you answer from the source, the repository, and `AGENTS.md`
  — all of which the stage already has in front of it — and then record.
- You **know the difference between a question and a blocker.** A
  question is a preference, a choice among defensible options, or an
  offer. A blocker is a condition the run cannot proceed *through*.
- You **classify from disk, not from narrative.** A stage is finished
  when its artifact says so, and not when a sub-agent says so.
- You **hand back cleanly.** A hand-back is an expected outcome, not a
  failure. You leave the slot resumable and name the exact command that
  resumes it.

## Inputs

1. **Target** *(required)* — the slot to run in. One of:
   - A **slot number** (one or more digits, e.g. `2`, `02`, `14`).
     Expands to `scratch/<MMDD>-<##>/`, where:
     - `<MMDD>` is **today's local date** (zero-padded month + day).
     - `<##>` is the slot number, **always zero-padded to two digits**.
   - A **full path** (absolute or repo-relative) to a slot **directory**.
     Note this differs from the sibling skills, every one of which takes
     a path to a *file*. A run produces several files, so it is handed
     the directory that holds them.
   - **Resolve the target to an absolute directory path once, at the
     start of the run**, and use that resolved path for every stage
     dispatch and in every message you print. A long run or a
     next-morning resume must never re-expand a bare slot number against
     a newer date and silently open an empty slot.
   - Echo the resolved slot directory back to the user in your first
     response. Create it if it does not exist.

2. **Kind** *(required)* — `request` or `report`. Selects `dev-request`
   (which writes `featurerequest.md`) or `dev-report` (which writes
   `bugreport.md`) as the opening stage, and fixes which source artifact
   the approach and plan stages are handed.

3. **Content** *(required for a new slot)* — the raw input. Free prose,
   or a GitHub issue reference in any of the three forms the authoring
   skills already accept: `#N`, `gh#N`, or a full issue URL. Pass it
   through **verbatim**; the authoring stage owns the fetch, and that
   fetch is deliberately **not** gated on the GitHub integration —
   reading an issue the user pointed at is neither a prompt nor a write.
   Content is optional on a resume, where the artifacts already carry it.

4. **`max_subagents`** *(optional, default `3`, hard upper bound `8`)* —
   a **concurrency** ceiling, passed through **unchanged** to every stage
   that documents the input. A stage that documents no such input simply
   does not receive it. Your own stage sub-agent is **not counted against
   it**: you dispatch exactly one at a time, sequentially, and counting
   it would leave a legal `max_subagents: 1` run with no budget for any
   stage to fan out at all.

5. **`review_iterations`** *(optional, default `1`)* — how many
   review-and-remediate cycles run after the execution stage. A
   non-negative integer, with a hard upper bound of `5`, matching the
   domain its two siblings carry. One iteration is a full `dev-review`
   pass **plus** remediation of what it raised, so the default leaves an
   `analysis.md` written *before* its own fixes; `2` re-reviews the
   remediated tree. **`0` skips the review tail entirely and ends the
   run at `dev-do`.** This is the only spelling — there is deliberately
   no flag-style alias for `0`, so that there is exactly one name per
   argument across the whole loop.

## What This Skill Owns

**Nothing.** Every file in the slot is written by the skill that owns it
today, dispatched here as a stage:

- `featurerequest.md` → `dev-request`
- `bugreport.md` → `dev-report`
- `approach-a.md`, `approach-b.md`, `approach-c.md`, and `approach.md` →
  `dev-approach`
- `plan.md` → `dev-plan` (created) and `dev-do` (updated)
- `analysis.md` → `dev-review`

You read all of them and write none of them. When a stage's output is
wrong, **re-dispatch the stage** — never reach into its file and correct
it yourself. Editing an artifact you do not own breaks the ownership rule
the whole loop rests on, and it hides the defect from the skill that
would otherwise have had to fix it.

## The Stage Chain

The chain is **fixed**. No argument skips a stage inside the authoring
chain.

```text
  dev-request / dev-report        the authoring chain: fixed,
            |                     no stage may be skipped
            v
      dev-approach
            |
            v
        dev-plan  <---------+
            |               |
            v               |  findings fold back into the plan
         dev-do             |  (x review_iterations)
            |               |
            v               |
       dev-review ----------+
```

The run, in order:

1. Resolve the slot directory to an absolute path and echo it. Resolve
   `SKILLS_SOURCE` and confirm every stage skill file exists.
2. **Check the slot for a source artifact of the other kind.** A
   `request` run into a slot that already holds a `bugreport.md`, or a
   `report` run into one holding a `featurerequest.md`, is a
   **blocker**: hand back and name both files. Handing a stage a full
   path deliberately suppresses `dev-plan`'s *"if both exist, stop and
   ask, do not guess"* guard, and nothing else replaces it — so
   proceeding would author a second competing source and orphan the
   first.
3. Read the repository's `AGENTS.md` for conventions and commands, with
   the documented fallback to `README.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and say
   which source you used.
4. Determine the resume point from the artifacts already on disk, and
   rebuild the assumption ledger from them — see § *Resume*.
5. Run each incomplete stage in chain order, one dispatch at a time,
   classifying each outcome from the artifact on disk.
6. Run the review tail `review_iterations` times.
7. Print the closing report.

Three properties of the chain are load-bearing:

- `dev-approach` is **optional in the hand-driven loop and mandatory
  here.** A run nobody is gating is exactly where a wrong solution shape
  would otherwise survive all the way to commits.
- The review tail is the **one sanctioned backward step**. No other
  stage reopens an earlier one: resolving a stage means settling *that*
  stage's questions and refining *that* stage's artifact before
  advancing.
- The chain ends at the review tail's remediation. It never extends to
  `dev-issue` or `dev-pr-open` — publishing and pushing stay
  user-initiated.

## Stage Dispatch

**Resolve the stage skills once.** `SKILLS_SOURCE` is the parent
directory of this skill's own directory, and each stage's file is
`<SKILLS_SOURCE>\<skill-name>\SKILL.md`. Confirm every file the run
needs exists before the first dispatch. A missing stage file is a
blocker: hand back and name it.

**Dispatch one sub-agent per stage.** This is load-bearing, not an
implementation detail. It keeps your own context small enough to survive
five-plus stages, it gives the retry loop a clean unit to retry, and —
because a fresh sub-agent re-reads the `SKILL.md` from disk — a
re-dispatch *is* the instruction reload that `dev-do`'s
self-modification yield asks for.

Hand each stage sub-agent exactly five things:

1. **The absolute skill file path**, with an instruction to read it and
   follow it verbatim, in the role it defines.
2. **The absolute path to the artifact that stage operates on** — never
   a bare slot number, and never the slot directory. Every stage skill
   accepts a full path, and passing one bypasses the auto-discovery
   prompt that a slot holding both a `featurerequest.md` and a
   `bugreport.md` would otherwise trigger. Which artifact that is
   differs by stage, and so does whether it is the stage's input or its
   output:

   | Stage | Skill | Path handed to it |
   |-|-|-|
   | Authoring | `dev-request` | `<slot>\featurerequest.md` |
   | Authoring | `dev-report` | `<slot>\bugreport.md` |
   | Approach | `dev-approach` | the source artifact above |
   | Plan | `dev-plan` | the source artifact above |
   | Execution | `dev-do` | `<slot>\plan.md` |
   | Review | `dev-review` | `<slot>\analysis.md` |

3. **The content, verbatim — the authoring stage only.** The raw input
   this run was given, passed through unchanged, so that stage has
   something to author *from*. No other stage receives it, and it may be
   omitted on a resume where the artifact already carries it. Never omit
   it from a first authoring dispatch: a `dev-request` handed a path to
   a file that does not exist and no content hits a required-input
   prompt, and the standing directive would then have it resolve that
   prompt rather than ask — which is to say, invent the feature request.
4. **The standing directive**, in full — see § *The Standing Directive*.
5. **`max_subagents`, unchanged**, when that stage documents the input,
   together with any other input that stage documents and this run
   fixes. The execution stage in particular runs with **no
   checkpointing**, because this run never pauses between phases.

A stage sub-agent runs with the **same model configuration as you**, per
`AGENTS.md` § *Agent guardrails*.

**Record a baseline immediately before every dispatch.** Read the
artifact that dispatch operates on and record its **content hash** — or
record that the artifact is **absent**. On return, re-read it and
compare. Without a baseline the byte-identical branch below is
unimplementable: a dispatch hands over a path and regains control on
return, and never reads the file in between. **Absent both before and
after counts as unchanged**, which is what covers an authoring stage
that never created its file at all.

**Classify every stage's outcome from the artifact on disk, never from
the sub-agent's narrative.** A sub-agent that simply stopped is
indistinguishable from one that finished unless the file says so. Take
these branches in order, **first match wins**:

1. **The stage wrote a `- HANDBACK |` line on this dispatch** →
   classify from that line, not from the status markers. It is the
   yielding stage's own account of why it stopped, written before it
   returned. Read it out of the section § *The Standing Directive* names
   for that artifact, carry its `attempt <k>` forward as that stage's
   attempt count, and quote its reason on hand-back. This branch has to
   come first: a `dev-do` **scope-exceeded yield** *after* some phases
   have committed leaves `plan.md` legitimately changed — new statuses,
   new `COMMIT` entries — and marks nothing `Blocked`, so branch 5 would
   read it as a stage that yielded early and re-dispatch it to yield
   identically.
2. **The artifact is byte-identical to the baseline** → **blocker**.
   Hand back and name it. Scope this to *unchanged from what this
   dispatch was handed*, never to "the stage had nothing to do":
   § *Resume* skips a complete stage by its status marker, so a stage
   with nothing to do is never dispatched at all. The likeliest instance
   is the most damning — `dev-do`'s pre-flight gate refuses a non-empty
   index and is forbidden to edit `plan.md` at all, so disk still reads
   `Ready-to-execute` with every phase `Pending`, and without this
   branch the rule to classify from disk makes a blocker this skill
   already lists structurally undetectable.
3. **An authoring stage** is judged by re-reading the artifact's `Status`
   row.
4. **The plan stage** is judged by re-reading `plan.md`'s `Status` row.
5. **The execution stage** is judged phase by phase: top-level
   `Status: Complete` with every phase `Complete` → advance; any phase
   marked `Blocked` → the diagnose-then-resume path in § *Retry and
   Hand-Back*; phases still `Pending` with no `Blocked` marker → the
   stage yielded early, so re-dispatch it to continue.

A stage that yields **without** a `- HANDBACK |` line was either
forbidden to write or had nowhere yet to write to; both carve-outs are
named in § *The Standing Directive*, and both are why that line's
absence never proves success. Branch 2 is what catches them.

Never edit an artifact to fix a stage's work. Re-dispatch the stage.

## The Standing Directive

This is the autonomy contract you hand to **every** stage sub-agent,
alongside the skill path. It changes nothing about the skill's file, its
format, or its prompts — it answers them, for that dispatch only.

It has three parts, and the boundaries between them are the whole point.

### Overridden — resolve on the merits, then record

The stage decides for itself, on the evidence in the source, the
repository, and `AGENTS.md`, and writes the decision into its own
artifact as settled content. It does not ask. This covers:

- The **open-questions walkthrough offer** in `dev-request`,
  `dev-report`, and `dev-plan`. Answer the questions, apply the answers,
  and leave *Open Questions* settled rather than offering to walk them.
- **Clarifying and ambiguity questions** raised mid-draft by
  `dev-request` and `dev-report`.
- **`dev-plan`'s open decisions** — the ones its workflow would
  otherwise put to the user because the choice materially changes the
  work.
- **`dev-approach`'s triviality proposal.** Default: **decline** it and
  run all three authors. A triviality call made before any design work
  is itself a claim about the solution's shape, and nobody is gating
  this run.
- **`dev-approach` § *Re-Invocation Modes*,** which stops and asks
  whenever the slot already holds any `approach*.md`. That fires on
  **every resume into a partly-finished approach stage**, so it must be
  answered rather than waited on. Default: **`judge-only`** when all
  three author files exist and are current with the source, and
  **`regenerate`** when they are missing or stale.
- **`dev-approach` § *User Override*'s** disagree-with-the-judge offer.
  Default: **accept the judge.** The run has no standing to overrule a
  verdict it just commissioned.
- **`dev-review`'s scope prompt**, in the case where it fires at all. It
  does not fire when `plan-slot` scope resolves.
- **An authoring stage advances `Status` to Ready-for-plan once no open
  question remains.** Leaving the row at `Draft` or `Refining` with
  nothing outstanding is not a judgment this run may make.
  `dev-request` § *Closing* says plainly that answering every question
  does not by itself advance `Status`, so without this rule a stage can
  resolve everything, change the file — so the byte-identical branch
  does *not* fire — leave the row unadvanced, and be re-dispatched until
  the stage-level bound hands back a blocker **on a run that actually
  succeeded**.

### Always resolved to *decline* — never on the merits

Every **hand-off offer** and every **publish offer**, without exception
and without weighing it:

- the `dev-approach` hand-off that `dev-request` and `dev-report` close
  with;
- the `dev-plan` hand-off that `dev-approach` closes with;
- the `dev-approach` nudge `dev-plan` makes when a slot holds no
  `approach.md`;
- every *"Publish this to GitHub?"* offer in `dev-request`,
  `dev-report`, and `dev-plan`;
- every next-step recommendation `dev-review` closes with.

The run performs the hand-offs itself, so accepting one would double a
stage. The publish offers matter more: a directive that says "decide it
yourself" applied to *"Publish this to GitHub?"* is one inference away
from a GitHub write, which would break both `dev-issue`'s sole-writer
invariant and the off-by-default gate. **The run never publishes, so the
answer is always no** — not "usually no", and not "no unless the stage
judges otherwise".

### Never overridden

- **"Never invent a build or test command."** An undocumented command is
  a **blocker**, not an assumption. It is the one question whose right
  answer is to stop.
- **`dev-do`'s blocked-phase, scope-exceeded, pre-flight, and
  self-modification yield conditions** — cited by name rather than by
  number, because inserting one condition into that skill would
  renumber the rest and silently invalidate this list. These are safety
  gates, not preference prompts. Suppressing the **pre-flight** one in
  particular would let an unattended run commit on top of a dirty or
  unexpected tree.
- **Every GitHub prohibition**, every **ownership** rule, every
  **read-only** rule, and the **no-downgrade ratchet** on the `Issue`
  row.

### The shape of a recorded answer

An answer lands in the stage's artifact as **settled content, in the
section it belongs to, written as a decision the artifact made.** Never
as *"the user said"* — the user said nothing. Never as a question left
open. A later reader must be able to see that a choice was made and what
it rested on. Each answer is *additionally* recorded as a ledger line —
see *The durable record* below.

### The durable record

Two kinds of line reach disk from a stage, and the **owning stage writes
both into its own artifact**; you never write either one. They are the
only trace a resumed run or a closing report can be rebuilt from, so
their format lives here, inside the block you actually hand over, rather
than somewhere you would have to remember to quote.

**The assumption line.** One per question the stage resolved under this
directive, carrying a fixed prefix so the whole ledger is one search
away:

```text
- ASSUMPTION | stage: <stage> | <question> — <answer> (<rationale>)
```

**The hand-back line.** One per dispatch that yields, written by the
**yielding stage** before it returns, into the same section of the same
artifact:

```text
- HANDBACK | stage: <stage> | attempt <k> | <reason>
```

Both follow the labelled-entry convention `plan.md`'s `## Progress Log`
already uses, **including the leading `- `**. Both go in a named section
of the stage's own artifact:

| Artifact | Section |
|-|-|
| `featurerequest.md` | `## Assumptions` |
| `bugreport.md` | `## Notes` |
| `approach.md` | `## Notes` |
| `plan.md` | `## Notes` |
| `analysis.md` | `## Notes` |

`featurerequest.md` is the only slot artifact with an `## Assumptions`
section; the rest carry a `## Notes` section and no assumptions section,
so that is where their lines go. The **prefix**, not the heading, is
what makes them findable. Do not collapse the table to a single
`plan.md` destination: `plan.md` does not exist during the authoring and
approach stages, `dev-review` may not write it, and `dev-approach` may
not write the source artifact.

**Two carve-outs on the hand-back line, both mandatory.**

- **A stage whose own skill forbids writing at the moment it yields
  writes no `HANDBACK` line.** The case that matters is `dev-do`'s
  **pre-flight refusal**: on a non-empty index it must stop without
  editing `plan.md` at all. The never-overridden rule wins — this
  directive never buys a write past a safety gate, and obeying it here
  would mean writing to a plan on a dirty tree, which is exactly what
  that gate exists to prevent. The byte-identical branch in § *Stage
  Dispatch* is what catches this outcome instead.
- **A stage whose artifact does not yet exist has nowhere to write.**
  `dev-request` can yield before `featurerequest.md` exists, `dev-plan`
  before `plan.md`, and `dev-review` writes `analysis.md` wholesale at
  the end. Such a hand-back is **undurable**: require the stage to say
  so in what it returns, and report it as undurable in the closing
  report and on resume — never silently. This is the earliest and least
  diagnosable class of failure there is, and it is the one the line
  otherwise no-ops on.

**Durability differs by stage, because two artifacts are rewritten
wholesale by the skill that owns them.**

- **`dev-review` overwrites `analysis.md` on every pass.** Its one
  overridable prompt is the scope prompt, which cannot fire when
  `plan-slot` scope resolves — the normal case here — so the review
  stage normally writes no line at all. Any line it *does* write must be
  **re-emitted** by the next pass, which is the only thing that keeps an
  overwrite from destroying it.
- **Every `dev-approach` mode rewrites `approach.md`.** That skill
  preserves the section its lines live in across a rewrite, which is
  what gives the two decisions this directive forces in that stage a
  home surviving both a re-judgment and a hand-back.

## The Assumption Ledger

Every question the run answered on the user's behalf is recorded, with
five things: the **stage**, the **question**, the **answer chosen**, a
**one-line rationale**, and the **artifact and section** the answer
landed in.

Two rules make the ledger survive a hand-back — which is an *expected*
outcome, and therefore cannot be allowed to lose the run's single review
point.

**1. Every assumption is written to a greppable, named location in the
artifact the owning skill already writes.** The owning stage writes it,
as part of the pass that made the decision; you never write it yourself.
Its exact line format and its destination table live in § *The Standing
Directive*, under *The durable record*, because that block is what a
stage sub-agent is actually handed — a directive excerpted without the
prefix would teach the stage nothing, nothing would reach disk, and a
resumed run would have nothing to rebuild from.

The ledger line is **in addition to** the settled content the answer
becomes, never a substitute for it. The content is what a reader of the
artifact needs; the line is what the ledger is rebuilt from.

**2. Resume rebuilds the ledger from disk** before continuing, by
reading those sections out of the artifacts that already exist. A
resumed run therefore closes with the assumptions made *before* the
hand-back as well as after, together with any `- HANDBACK |` line those
same sections carry.

This is the closing report's most prominent section. It is never
summarized away, never truncated, and never folded into a sentence about
how the run "made some assumptions along the way".

## Resume

A re-invocation with the same arguments **resumes**. It is not a mode
switch and it needs no flag. Pick up at the first incomplete stage,
judged by **status markers, never by file presence** — a file that
exists proves a stage started, not that it finished.

- **Authoring** is complete when the request's or report's `Status` row
  reads `Ready-for-plan`.
- **Approach** is complete when `approach.md` exists and carries a
  `## Selected` section.
- **Plan** is incomplete **only** when the `Status` row of `plan.md`
  reads `Draft`; any other value means the plan stage is done. One
  value, no ordering claim, and nothing to rot when `dev-plan` gains a
  status — where "`Ready-to-execute` or a later value" would assert an
  ordering that `Blocked` has no position in.
- **Execution** is complete when the plan's top-level `Status` reads
  `Complete` **and** every phase's `**Status:**` reads `Complete`.
- **Review tail** progress is the highest `<k>` carried by a
  `- REVIEW | iteration: <k> | complete` marker in `plan.md`'s
  `## Progress Log` — see § *The Review Tail*.

A `Blocked` marker means resume **re-enters** the stage that owns it
rather than skipping past it — and where `plan.md` is concerned, that
is scoped to the **phase** markers only. A plan whose *top-level*
`Status` reads `Blocked` because `dev-do` stopped mid-execution belongs
to the execution stage; re-entering the plan stage would re-dispatch
`dev-plan` against a plan that is already being executed. Rebuild the
assumption ledger from the artifacts before continuing, read any
`- HANDBACK |` line those same sections carry so the earlier attempt is
diagnosed rather than repeated, and say in your first response which
stage you resumed at and why. A stage that handed back **undurably**
left no line at all; say so rather than reporting a clean history.

## Retry and Hand-Back

**A failing phase gets three attempts in total — the first, plus two
retries.** The counter is **per phase**, not per stage, so one stubborn
phase cannot spend a long plan's whole budget. The bound is internal and
is deliberately **not** a caller knob: a phase that keeps failing is a
wrong phase, and retrying it harder will not make it right.

**A stage gets three dispatches in total, for the same reason.** These
are **two different counters**, and conflating them is what lets a run
spin. The per-phase bound is scoped to a *failing* `Blocked` phase, so
it counts nothing at all for a stage that yields early, hands back
without a `Blocked` marker, or returns unchanged — and those are exactly
the cases a re-dispatch loop is made of. Count dispatches per stage,
across resumes, using the `attempt <k>` on that stage's `- HANDBACK |`
line; a stage that exhausts three is a blocker.

**A retry is a diagnose-then-resume dispatch, never a bare
re-dispatch.** `dev-do` § *Iteration Mode (Recovery Path)* resumes a
`Blocked` phase only when the blocker is demonstrably resolved, and
otherwise reports it unchanged — so a bare re-dispatch would burn all
three attempts without ever retrying anything. Attempt *k* hands the
stage sub-agent the recorded `Blocked` reason **and** an explicit
instruction to diagnose and resolve the cause **first**, then resume the
phase. Without that the bound absorbs nothing — not the typo, not the
missing import, not the stale artifact it exists for.

**Each attempt is recorded durably by the stage itself**, using
`dev-do`'s existing log form:

```text
- NOTE | phase: <n> | attempt <k>: <what was tried>
```

That is what makes `plan.md` name the phase that failed *and what was
tried*, rather than leaving it in a transcript that dies with the
session.

**A stage that yields also writes its own `- HANDBACK |` line**, in the
form and destination § *The Standing Directive* fixes, before it
returns — so the reason survives the session that produced it, and so a
run resumed tomorrow can see that attempt 1 already failed the same way.
The two carve-outs there are the only exceptions, and the second of them
makes the hand-back **undurable**, which you report as undurable rather
than passing over in silence.

**A blocker is a condition the run cannot proceed *through*.** It is
never merely a question the run would prefer a human answered. These are
blockers:

- a build, test, or lint command the repository's `AGENTS.md` does not
  document;
- a failure the run cannot explain;
- a repository state it cannot safely act on, including anything
  `dev-do`'s pre-flight gate refuses;
- a stage that returns with its artifact byte-identical to the baseline
  recorded before the dispatch;
- a `dev-do` **scope-exceeded yield** — non-overridable, marking nothing
  `Blocked` and requiring no `NOTE`, so nothing else in this list would
  catch it;
- a phase that exhausts its three attempts, or a stage that exhausts its
  three dispatches;
- a missing stage skill file;
- a change the run made to **this** skill.

**On hand-back, report:** the stage and the phase, the attempts and what
each one tried, the evidence, the ledger rebuilt so far, whether the
stage's own `- HANDBACK |` line reached disk or the hand-back was
undurable, and **the exact command that resumes the run**. Quote that
command in **full-path form**, never as a bare slot number — a number
re-expands against the date of whatever day the user picks the work back
up, which is not necessarily today.

## The Review Tail

One **iteration** is a `dev-review` pass **plus** remediation of what it
raised. `review_iterations` counts iterations, not passes.

**Scope resolves itself.** `dev-review` derives `plan-slot` scope from
the plan's `COMMIT` entries without asking. When the plan carries **no**
`COMMIT` entries there is nothing to review. Skip the tail, and then
report it in the closing report, naming why.

**Remediation covers Blocker *and* High findings, not Blockers alone.**
That is not a choice this skill gets to make: `dev-plan` § *Iteration
Mode* names Blocker and High as the fold-back set, and `dev-review`
§ *Report Format* prescribes an `analysis.md` whose `## Next Steps`
section says the same. A narrower rule here would contradict the two
skills this stage dispatches. Lower severities are reported, not
remediated.

**Remediation runs as a `dev-plan` iteration pass** handed
`analysis.md`, which appends new phases to `plan.md`. Those phases
**keep `dev-plan`'s numbered heading** and carry the marker in the name:

```text
### Phase <n>: Remediation R<k> — <name>
```

`<n>` continues the plan's existing numbering and `<k>` is the 1-based
iteration index. The number is load-bearing: `dev-do`'s `PENDING` /
`COMMIT` / `NOTE` log entries are keyed on `phase: <n>`, so an
unnumbered heading would break the log form and change an existing
skill's output format. A `dev-do` pass then executes those phases under
its ordinary phase-commit protocol.

**Every iteration must leave a marker, clean or not.** A review that
raises no Blocker or High appends no phases, so remediation phases alone
cannot distinguish "iteration *k* ran clean" from "iteration *k* never
ran" — and guessing wrong burns a full two-pass review and overwrites
`analysis.md` again. The **`dev-plan` remediation stage** therefore
appends one line to `plan.md`'s `## Progress Log` on **every**
iteration, clean or not, before it returns:

```text
- REVIEW | iteration: <k> | complete
```

**Iteration *k* is complete when a marker naming `<k>` is present**, and
the tail's progress is the highest `<k>` recorded. Keep `analysis.md`'s
`## Scope` **Commits** bullet as a cross-check on what the surviving
analysis actually saw — never as the completeness test. Remediation
appends new `COMMIT` entries to the plan by construction, so the two
sets diverge for every iteration that raised a finding, and any test
comparing them is satisfiable only in the clean case. The `| Scope |`
metadata row records a counted description rather than the SHAs
themselves, so it is a cross-check on the count.

Two properties of the marker are load-bearing. It carries **no
`phase: <n>` key**, because a clean iteration appends no phases and so
has no phase number to name, and because a writer that is not `dev-do`
must not inject a phase-keyed entry into a log `dev-do` § *Iteration
Mode (Recovery Path)* reads as recovery evidence. And it **names its
writer explicitly** — the remediation `dev-plan` pass — because "the
remediation pass" does not exist in the clean case the marker was
invented to disambiguate. The form is a fourth labelled entry in a log
`dev-plan` owns and documents, so it extends *that* skill's vocabulary
and changes nothing about `dev-do`'s.

**`dev-review` overwrites `analysis.md` on every pass.** With
`review_iterations: 2` the surviving file is the second pass's. That is
`dev-review`'s documented behavior and is not changed here — say in the
closing report which iteration the file reflects.

**Any finding still standing when the budget runs out is reported**
alongside the ledger, and just as prominently. Exhausting the iteration
budget is not a failure and not a hand-back; it is a result the user
reviews.

## Progress Output

Print one short line per stage entered, per artifact written, and per
assumption recorded. The user who invoked this skill is watching the
session even though they are not answering prompts, so write it for a
reader.

**Those lines land at stage boundaries**, because that is where you
regain control. The execution stage in particular is **atomic from your
side**: `dev-do` runs every phase and makes every commit before it
returns, so no line of yours can appear between two phases. A user who
wants a gate there has two options, and neither of them is this skill —
drive the loop by hand, or invoke `dev-do` directly and use its
`checkpoint_every` input.

Keep it to one line each. A stage's own output is that stage's business;
you are reporting the shape of the run, not narrating it.

## Closing Report

In this order:

1. **The slot** — the resolved absolute path.
2. **The artifacts** — which ones exist, and one line on what each says.
3. **The commits** the execution stage made, SHA and subject, in
   chronological order.
4. **The assumption ledger** — every question the run answered on the
   user's behalf, in full: one entry per question, with the stage, the
   answer, the rationale, and where it landed. **This is the most
   prominent part of the report, and the one part that must not be
   summarized away.** Because the run never paused, it is the user's
   single review point.
5. **Standing findings** — anything `dev-review` raised that the
   iteration budget did not close, at the same prominence as the
   ledger, plus which iteration the surviving `analysis.md` reflects —
   or state that the review tail did not run, and why.
6. **Next steps**, named as available to the **user** and never
   performed: `dev-issue` to publish the request or report and attach
   the plan, `dev-pr-open` to push the branch and open the pull request.
   State plainly that nothing was pushed and no pull request was opened.

## Important Rules

- **This skill owns no artifact.** Every slot file belongs to the skill
  that writes it. Read them all; write none of them. When a stage's
  output is wrong, re-dispatch the stage — never edit its file to fix
  its work.
- **A question never stops the run. A blocker always does.** Resolving a
  question into a recorded assumption is the entire point of the skill.
  Confusing the two defeats it in both directions: stopping on a
  question makes the run no better than the hand-driven loop, and
  proceeding through a blocker produces work nobody can trust.
- **Never invent a build, test, or lint command.** Commands come from
  the repository's `AGENTS.md`, with the documented fallback to
  `README.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md` and an obligation to state which
  source was used. A command that is not documented is a blocker, and
  the standing directive never overrides that.
- **Every hand-off and publish offer resolves to *decline*.** Not on the
  merits, not "usually" — always. It is the one class of question the
  standing directive answers with a fixed value, because the alternative
  puts a GitHub write one inference away.
- **Local commits only.** No `git push`, no pull request, no commit
  outside `dev-do`'s phase-commit protocol, and no commit made by you
  directly. Pushing and opening a pull request belong to `dev-pr-open`,
  which the user invokes.
- **No GitHub writes at all**, and `analysis.md` and `approach*.md` are
  **never** published — not as an issue, not as a comment, not as a
  quotation in a pull request body. Fetching an issue the user named as
  content is a read, and is allowed.
- **Today's date governs slot expansion.** Never reuse a previous day's
  `<MMDD>` for a numeric slot. For an earlier slot the user must give a
  full path — and once resolved, the absolute path is what you use for
  the rest of the run.
- **The concurrency cap is a hard ceiling.** Pass `max_subagents`
  through unchanged and never exceed it. You dispatch one stage
  sub-agent at a time, and it is not counted against the cap.
- **Re-invocation is the recovery path, not a mode switch.** The same
  command resumes a handed-back run. There is no flag naming a stage to
  start at; resume is inferred from the artifacts' status markers.
- **Stop and hand back if the run modified this skill.** A stage
  sub-agent reloads its own instructions on the next dispatch, which is
  what makes `dev-do`'s self-modification yield safe. You cannot reload
  *yourself* mid-run. If a completed phase changed `dev-complete`,
  record the durable result and hand back, so that a fresh invocation
  loads the new instructions before anything else runs.
- **Honor repo conventions.** Repository conventions live in
  `AGENTS.md`. Follow its code style and architectural invariants, and
  where it is silent, match the surrounding code rather than importing a
  preference from another repository.
