# Git PR Helper

Expert at managing git workflows for pull requests, merges, and branch management with a focus on safety, quality, and best practices.

## Core Mission

Assist with pull request creation, branch management, merge coordination, and conflict resolution while ensuring code quality and preventing data loss.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating a pull request from a feature branch
- Merging branches (feature → main/master)
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Cleaning up old session or feature branches
- Generating PR descriptions from commits
- Checking if work is ready to merge
- Recovering from git mistakes

**Do NOT use this skill for:**
- Preventing file deletion (use git hooks + CLAUDE.md instead)
- Creating session branches at workflow start (use CLAUDE.md guidance)
- Enforcing branch policies (use git hooks instead)

## Skill Capabilities

### 1. Pull Request Creation

**Purpose:** Create high-quality pull requests with comprehensive descriptions

#### Create PR with Generated Description

To create a PR:

1. **Verify we're on a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
   if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "main" ] || [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "master" ]; then
       echo "❌ ERROR: Cannot create PR from main/master branch"
       exit 1
   fi
   echo "✓ Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
   ```

2. **Check git status is clean:**
   ```bash
   if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]; then
       echo "⚠️  WARNING: Uncommitted changes detected"
       git status --short
       echo ""
       echo "Commit these changes before creating PR? (y/n)"
       # Ask user via AskUserQuestion tool
   else
       echo "✓ Working tree clean"
   fi
   ```

3. **Determine base branch:**
   ```bash
   # Try to detect default branch
   BASE_BRANCH=$(git remote show origin 2>/dev/null | grep 'HEAD branch' | cut -d' ' -f5)

   # Fallback to checking what exists
   if [ -z "$BASE_BRANCH" ]; then
       if git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/main; then
           BASE_BRANCH="main"
       elif git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/master; then
           BASE_BRANCH="master"
       else
           echo "⚠️  Cannot detect base branch. Please specify manually."
       fi
   fi

   echo "Base branch: $BASE_BRANCH"
   ```

4. **Get all commits on this branch:**
   ```bash
   # Get commit history since branch diverged from base
   git log $BASE_BRANCH..HEAD --oneline

   # Get detailed commit info
   git log $BASE_BRANCH..HEAD --format="%h %s%n%b" --reverse
   ```

5. **Get diff summary:**
   ```bash
   # File changes summary
   git diff $BASE_BRANCH...HEAD --stat

   # List changed files
   git diff $BASE_BRANCH...HEAD --name-only
   ```

6. **Generate PR description:**

   Analyze commits and changes to create:

   ```markdown
   ## Summary
   - [Brief bullet points of main changes]
   - [Focus on WHY, not WHAT]
   - [User-facing impact]

   ## Changes Made
   - [Detailed technical changes]
   - [Components affected]
   - [API changes if applicable]

   ## Testing
   - [ ] Unit tests added/updated
   - [ ] Manual testing completed
   - [ ] Edge cases considered
   - [ ] Documentation updated

   ## Related Issues
   Closes #[issue-number] (if applicable)

   ## Notes for Reviewers
   [Any context reviewers should know]
   [Areas needing special attention]
   ```

7. **Check if remote tracking branch exists:**
   ```bash
   if git rev-parse --verify --quiet origin/$CURRENT_BRANCH >/dev/null 2>&1; then
       echo "✓ Remote branch exists"
   else
       echo "⚠️  Remote branch does not exist. Need to push first."
       echo "Push now? (y/n)"
       # If yes: git push -u origin $CURRENT_BRANCH
   fi
   ```

8. **Create PR using GitHub CLI:**
   ```bash
   gh pr create \
       --title "[Generated title from commits]" \
       --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   [Generated PR description]
   EOF
   )" \
       --base "$BASE_BRANCH" \
       --head "$CURRENT_BRANCH"
   ```

9. **Update CLAUDE-activeContext.md (if exists):**
   ```bash
   if [ -f CLAUDE-activeContext.md ]; then
       # Add PR link to active context
       PR_URL=$(gh pr view --json url -q .url)
       echo "PR created: $PR_URL" >> CLAUDE-activeContext.md
   fi
   ```

#### Generate PR Description Only

To generate a PR description without creating the PR:

1. Follow steps 1-6 above
2. Output the generated description for user review
3. Ask if user wants to create PR with this description

### 2. Merge Coordination

**Purpose:** Safely merge branches with conflict detection and resolution guidance

#### Check Merge Readiness

To check if branch is ready to merge:

```bash
echo "=== MERGE READINESS CHECK ==="
echo ""

# 1. Check current branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
BASE_BRANCH=${BASE_BRANCH:-main}

if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "$BASE_BRANCH" ]; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Already on base branch $BASE_BRANCH"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✓ Feature branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
echo ""

# 2. Check for uncommitted changes
if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]; then
    echo "❌ Uncommitted changes detected:"
    git status --short
    echo ""
else
    echo "✓ Working tree clean"
    echo ""
fi

# 3. Fetch latest from remote
echo "Fetching latest from remote..."
git fetch origin $BASE_BRANCH
echo ""

# 4. Check if base branch has new commits
BEHIND=$(git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/$BASE_BRANCH)
if [ "$BEHIND" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "⚠️  Base branch has $BEHIND new commits"
    echo "Consider rebasing: git rebase origin/$BASE_BRANCH"
else
    echo "✓ Up to date with base branch"
fi
echo ""

# 5. Check for conflicts
echo "Checking for potential conflicts..."
git merge-tree $(git merge-base HEAD origin/$BASE_BRANCH) HEAD origin/$BASE_BRANCH > /tmp/merge-preview.txt

if grep -q "changed in both" /tmp/merge-preview.txt; then
    echo "⚠️  CONFLICTS DETECTED:"
    grep -A 3 "changed in both" /tmp/merge-preview.txt
    echo ""
else
    echo "✓ No conflicts detected"
    echo ""
fi

# 6. Run tests (if test command exists)
if [ -f package.json ] && grep -q "\"test\"" package.json; then
    echo "Running tests..."
    npm test
elif [ -f pytest.ini ] || [ -d tests ]; then
    echo "Running tests..."
    pytest
elif [ -f Cargo.toml ]; then
    echo "Running tests..."
    cargo test
else
    echo "ℹ️  No test command found (skipped)"
fi
echo ""

# 7. Check CI status (if using GitHub)
if command -v gh &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Checking CI status..."
    gh pr checks 2>/dev/null || echo "ℹ️  No PR found or CI configured"
fi

echo ""
echo "=== READINESS CHECK COMPLETE ==="
```

#### Merge Branch Safely

To merge a feature branch:

1. **Run merge readiness check** (above)

2. **Ask user for merge strategy:**
   - Regular merge (preserves all commits)
   - Squash merge (single commit)
   - Rebase and merge (linear history)

3. **For regular merge:**
   ```bash
   git checkout $BASE_BRANCH
   git merge --no-ff $FEATURE_BRANCH -m "Merge branch '$FEATURE_BRANCH'"
   ```

4. **For squash merge:**
   ```bash
   git checkout $BASE_BRANCH
   git merge --squash $FEATURE_BRANCH

   # Generate commit message from all commits
   git log $BASE_BRANCH..$FEATURE_BRANCH --format="%s" > /tmp/commit-msg.txt

   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   [Squashed commit title]

   Changes included:
   $(cat /tmp/commit-msg.txt)
   EOF
   )"
   ```

5. **For rebase and merge:**
   ```bash
   git checkout $FEATURE_BRANCH
   git rebase $BASE_BRANCH
   git checkout $BASE_BRANCH
   git merge --ff-only $FEATURE_BRANCH
   ```

6. **Push to remote:**
   ```bash
   git push origin $BASE_BRANCH
   ```

7. **Clean up feature branch (optional):**
   ```bash
   # Delete local branch
   git branch -d $FEATURE_BRANCH

   # Delete remote branch
   git push origin --delete $FEATURE_BRANCH
   ```

### 3. Conflict Resolution

**Purpose:** Guide through merge conflict resolution

#### Detect and Analyze Conflicts

When conflicts occur:

1. **Show conflicted files:**
   ```bash
   git status | grep "both modified"
   ```

2. **For each conflicted file, show conflict markers:**
   ```bash
   grep -n "<<<<<<< HEAD" $CONFLICTED_FILE
   ```

3. **Explain the conflict:**
   - `<<<<<<< HEAD` = Your current branch changes
   - `=======` = Separator
   - `>>>>>>> branch-name` = Incoming branch changes

4. **Provide resolution strategies:**
   - Accept current changes (ours): `git checkout --ours $FILE`
   - Accept incoming changes (theirs): `git checkout --theirs $FILE`
   - Manually resolve: Edit file to keep both/choose wisely

5. **After resolution:**
   ```bash
   git add $RESOLVED_FILE
   git status  # Verify all conflicts resolved
   git merge --continue  # or git rebase --continue
   ```

#### Abort Problematic Merge

If merge goes wrong:

```bash
# Abort merge
git merge --abort

# Abort rebase
git rebase --abort

# Return to clean state
git status
```

### 4. Branch Cleanup

**Purpose:** Safely remove old session/feature branches

#### List Branches for Cleanup

To identify branches that can be cleaned up:

```bash
echo "=== BRANCH CLEANUP ANALYSIS ==="
echo ""

# Get current branch and base branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
BASE_BRANCH=${BASE_BRANCH:-main}

# List all local branches
echo "Local branches:"
git branch -vv
echo ""

# List merged branches (safe to delete)
echo "Merged branches (safe to delete):"
git branch --merged $BASE_BRANCH | grep -v "^\*" | grep -v "$BASE_BRANCH"
echo ""

# List unmerged branches (check before deleting)
echo "Unmerged branches (verify before deleting):"
git branch --no-merged $BASE_BRANCH | grep -v "^\*"
echo ""

# Show last commit date for each branch
echo "Branch activity (last commit date):"
for branch in $(git branch | sed 's/^\*/ /'); do
    printf "%-30s %s\n" "$branch" "$(git log -1 --format=%cd --date=relative $branch)"
done
```

#### Clean Up Merged Branches

To delete merged branches:

```bash
# Get list of merged branches (excluding current and base)
MERGED_BRANCHES=$(git branch --merged $BASE_BRANCH | grep -v "^\*" | grep -v "$BASE_BRANCH" | grep -v "main" | grep -v "master")

if [ -z "$MERGED_BRANCHES" ]; then
    echo "No merged branches to clean up"
else
    echo "The following merged branches will be deleted:"
    echo "$MERGED_BRANCHES"
    echo ""
    echo "Proceed? (requires user confirmation)"

    # If confirmed:
    echo "$MERGED_BRANCHES" | xargs git branch -d

    echo "✓ Local merged branches deleted"
    echo ""
    echo "Delete remote branches too? (requires user confirmation)"

    # If confirmed:
    echo "$MERGED_BRANCHES" | xargs -I {} git push origin --delete {}
fi
```

#### Clean Up Session Branches

To clean up old session branches specifically:

```bash
# Find session branches (pattern: session/*)
SESSION_BRANCHES=$(git branch | grep "session/" | sed 's/^\*/ /' | xargs)

if [ -z "$SESSION_BRANCHES" ]; then
    echo "No session branches found"
else
    echo "Session branches:"
    for branch in $SESSION_BRANCHES; do
        MERGED=$(git branch --merged $BASE_BRANCH | grep -q "$branch" && echo "✓ merged" || echo "✗ unmerged")
        LAST_COMMIT=$(git log -1 --format="%cd" --date=relative $branch)
        printf "%-40s %-12s %s\n" "$branch" "$MERGED" "$LAST_COMMIT"
    done
    echo ""

    # Ask which to delete
    echo "Delete merged session branches? (y/n)"
    # If yes, delete only merged ones
fi
```

### 5. PR Review Assistance

**Purpose:** Help review PRs and provide feedback

#### Analyze PR Changes

To review a PR:

```bash
# Get PR number from user or current branch
PR_NUMBER=${1:-$(gh pr view --json number -q .number 2>/dev/null)}

if [ -z "$PR_NUMBER" ]; then
    echo "No PR found. Specify PR number or create a PR first."
    exit 1
fi

# Get PR details
gh pr view $PR_NUMBER

# Get diff
gh pr diff $PR_NUMBER

# Get file changes summary
gh pr diff $PR_NUMBER --name-only

# Check CI status
gh pr checks $PR_NUMBER

# Get review comments
gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --comments
```

#### Suggest Reviewers

To suggest reviewers based on changed files:

```bash
# Get files changed in PR
CHANGED_FILES=$(gh pr diff $PR_NUMBER --name-only)

# For each file, find who modified it recently (git blame approach)
echo "Suggested reviewers based on file ownership:"
for file in $CHANGED_FILES; do
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then
        git log --format='%an' -n 5 "$file" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -1
    fi
done | sort | uniq
```

### 6. Emergency Recovery

**Purpose:** Recover from git mistakes

#### Undo Last Commit (Not Pushed)

To undo the last commit while keeping changes:

```bash
# Soft reset (keep changes staged)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Mixed reset (keep changes unstaged)
git reset HEAD~1

# Verify
git status
```

#### Recover Deleted Branch

To recover a recently deleted branch:

```bash
# Find the commit SHA of the deleted branch
git reflog | grep "$BRANCH_NAME"

# Recreate branch from that commit
git branch $BRANCH_NAME $COMMIT_SHA

# Verify
git log $BRANCH_NAME --oneline -n 5
```

#### Undo Merge

To undo a merge that was pushed:

```bash
# Find merge commit
git log --oneline --merges -n 5

# Revert the merge (safe for shared branches)
git revert -m 1 $MERGE_COMMIT_SHA

# Push the revert
git push origin $BASE_BRANCH
```

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Create PR from Feature Branch

User request: "Create a PR for my authentication feature"

**Workflow:**
1. Check current branch is `feature/add-auth`
2. Verify working tree is clean
3. Get commits: `git log main..HEAD`
4. Analyze changes: Added `auth.js`, `login.js`, updated `server.js`
5. Generate PR description highlighting JWT implementation, login endpoint, and tests
6. Check remote branch exists, push if needed
7. Create PR: `gh pr create --title "Add JWT authentication" --body "..."`
8. Output PR URL to user

### Example 2: Merge with Conflicts

User request: "Merge my feature branch but there are conflicts"

**Workflow:**
1. Run merge readiness check
2. Detect conflicts in `config.js` and `package.json`
3. Attempt merge: `git merge feature/update-deps`
4. Conflicts occur - pause and analyze
5. Show conflicted sections for each file
6. Guide user: "In package.json, both branches updated dependencies. Accept theirs for packages, ours for custom scripts."
7. After user resolves: `git add config.js package.json`
8. Complete merge: `git merge --continue`
9. Push: `git push origin main`

### Example 3: Clean Up Old Session Branches

User request: "Clean up my session branches from last week"

**Workflow:**
1. List all session branches: `git branch | grep session/`
2. Find: `session/20241020-add-api`, `session/20241021-refactor-db`
3. Check merge status for each
4. First branch merged, second branch not merged
5. Show unmerged commits for second branch
6. Ask user: "Second branch has 3 unmerged commits. Delete anyway?"
7. If yes to merged: `git branch -d session/20241020-add-api`
8. If yes to unmerged: `git branch -D session/20241021-refactor-db` (force delete)
9. Clean remote branches: `git push origin --delete session/20241020-add-api`

### Example 4: Emergency - Undo Accidental Merge

User request: "I accidentally merged the wrong branch into main!"

**Workflow:**
1. Check git log: Find merge commit 5 minutes ago
2. Verify not pushed yet: `git status` shows "ahead of origin/main"
3. Undo merge: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
4. Verify: `git log` shows merge is gone
5. Guide: "If already pushed, use `git revert -m 1 $SHA` instead"
6. User confirms correct state restored

## Best Practices

1. **Always run readiness check** before merging
2. **Generate PR descriptions from commits** - saves time, ensures completeness
3. **Use semantic branch names** - `feature/`, `fix/`, `session/` prefixes
4. **Clean up merged branches promptly** - reduces clutter
5. **Test before creating PR** - ensures CI will pass
6. **Squash WIP commits** - clean up "wip", "fix typo" commits before merging
7. **Update CLAUDE-activeContext.md** with PR links for tracking
8. **Never force-push to shared branches** without team coordination
9. **Use `--no-ff` for feature merges** - preserves branch history
10. **Rebase feature branches** regularly to avoid large conflicts

## Integration with CLAUDE.md

This skill complements CLAUDE.md git safety protocol:
- **CLAUDE.md**: Prevents issues (branch creation, safety checks before destructive ops)
- **git-pr-helper**: Assists with workflows (PR creation, merge coordination, cleanup)

Both work together:
1. CLAUDE.md guides creating branches before work
2. User does work, commits regularly
3. **git-pr-helper** helps create quality PR when ready
4. **git-pr-helper** assists with merge
5. **git-pr-helper** cleans up branches

## Safety Features

- ✅ Always checks working tree status before operations
- ✅ Detects conflicts before merging
- ✅ Requires user confirmation for destructive operations
- ✅ Preserves unmerged work (warns before deleting)
- ✅ Provides recovery guidance for mistakes
- ✅ Never auto-merges without user review
- ✅ Tests integration with base branch before merge

## Limitations

- Cannot prevent file deletion before commits (use git hooks + CLAUDE.md)
- Cannot automatically invoke at session boundaries (no session concept)
- Cannot enforce branch policies (use git hooks)
- Requires `gh` CLI for GitHub PR operations
- Requires network connectivity for remote operations
- Cannot resolve semantic conflicts (only syntactic)
- PR description generation quality depends on commit message quality

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# PR Creation
gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."              # Create PR
gh pr view                                           # View current PR
gh pr checks                                         # Check CI status

# Merge Operations
git merge --no-ff feature/branch                     # Merge preserving history
git merge --squash feature/branch                    # Squash all commits
git rebase main                                      # Rebase onto main

# Branch Management
git branch --merged main                             # List merged branches
git branch -d branch-name                            # Delete local branch
git push origin --delete branch-name                 # Delete remote branch

# Conflict Resolution
git merge --abort                                    # Abort merge
git checkout --ours file.txt                         # Accept our version
git checkout --theirs file.txt                       # Accept their version

# Recovery
git reflog                                           # View ref history
git reset --soft HEAD~1                              # Undo last commit
git revert -m 1 $SHA                                 # Revert merge
```
