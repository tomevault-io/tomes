## Local Overlay

If present, also read `AGENTS.local.md` at the repo root. It is gitignored, so personal overlays stay local — check the exact path directly (`Read` or `cat`), not via ignore-respecting tools such as `rg`, `fd`, or `git ls-files`. Follow it where it does not conflict with this file.

## Role & Expertise

Act as a Principal Engineer working on production Kubernetes infrastructure in Go. NVSentinel takes GPU nodes out of service and reboots them in live clusters, so a wrong decision here evicts real customer workloads. Favour correctness and operational safety over cleverness. All code must be production-grade, not illustrative.

## Project Overview

NVSentinel is a GPU node resilience system for Kubernetes. It detects, classifies and remediates hardware and software faults on GPU nodes.

**Pipeline:** Detect → Ingest → Act

```

**Every health monitor is peer to every other one.** GPU, syslog, CSP, NIC, Kubernetes Object Monitor and the Health Events Analyzer are all just health monitors — the analyzer detects patterns across events rather than reading a device, but it has no special status in the pipeline and publishes over the same gRPC interface as the rest. Treat "add a monitor" as the same shape of task regardless of which one you are looking at.

Platform-connectors persists events to the store (MongoDB with change streams, or PostgreSQL) and updates node conditions on the Kubernetes API. Fault Quarantine, Node Drainer and Fault Remediation reconcile from the store and act on the cluster. Janitor is driven differently — it reconciles the maintenance CRs that Fault Remediation creates, via the Kubernetes API rather than the store.

**No module calls another module directly.** Coordination happens through the shared event store and the Kubernetes API. A change that introduces a direct call between two modules is almost certainly wrong — check [docs/designs/](docs/designs/) before proposing one.

**Tech stack:** Go 1.27.0, Python 3.10+ (Poetry), Kubernetes, gRPC + protobuf, MongoDB / PostgreSQL, Helm, DCGM. Tool versions are pinned in `.versions.yaml` — that file is the single source of truth; read it with `make show-versions`, never hardcode a version elsewhere.

## Commands

```bash
# THE gate. Run this before every PR — it is what CI runs.
make lint-test-all   # protos-lint + license-headers-lint + gomod-lint + all Go/Python/Helm/shell lint+test

# Individual module (every Go module has the same interface via make/go.mk)
make -C labeler lint-test    # vet + lint + test for one module
make -C labeler vet          # go vet ./...
make -C labeler lint         # golangci-lint with the repo .golangci.yml
make -C labeler test         # gotestsum, race detector on
make -C labeler coverage     # coverage report

# Single test
cd labeler && go test -race -run TestKataLabelDetection ./...

# Local cluster (ctlptl-managed Kind + registry, driven by Tilt)
make dev-env         # create cluster + start Tilt
make dev-env-clean   # stop Tilt + delete cluster
make dev-restart     # restart Tilt without recreating the cluster
make e2e-test        # end-to-end suite against the local cluster

# Codegen and hygiene — run after touching protobufs or go.mod
make protos-generate      # regenerate Go + Python protobuf bindings
make dependencies-sync    # sync deps across modules via the Go workspace
make go-mod-tidy-all      # go mod tidy in every module
make license-headers-lint # Apache 2.0 headers on all source files

# Images
make ko-build     # Go images (ko — no Dockerfile involved)
make docker-all   # Dockerfile-based images (Python, shell, CUDA/DCGM-based)

make help         # every target
```

**Non-obvious tooling.** This repo uses several tools an agent will not infer from the file tree: `ko` builds Go container images with no Dockerfile (most Go modules have none — do not "fix" that by adding one); `ctlptl` manages the Kind cluster *and* its local registry; `Tilt` drives the dev inner loop; `gotestsum` is the test runner; `setup-envtest` provisions the real API server binaries used by controller tests; `yq` reads `.versions.yaml` in scripts. Install everything with `make dev-env-setup`.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **Read before writing** — never modify a file you have not read.
2. **Run `make lint-test-all` before you claim work is done.** Fix every failure. Do not treat a pre-existing failure as acceptable without saying so explicitly.
3. **Never weaken a test to make it pass.** Do not skip, comment out, or loosen an assertion to get green. Fix the code.
4. **Never bypass a gate** — no `--no-verify`, no skipping DCO sign-off, no disabling a linter rule to avoid fixing the finding.
5. **Match existing patterns** — read a sibling module before inventing an approach.
6. **3-strike rule** — after 3 failed attempts at the same fix, stop and reassess rather than piling on changes.
7. **Every I/O path takes a `context.Context`** with cancellation honoured, and long-running loops must check `ctx.Done()`.
8. **Remediation is destructive** — code that cordons, drains, reboots or resets a node needs a test proving it does *not* fire in the healthy case.
9. **Read the ADRs before changing behaviour** — see [Architecture Decision Records](#architecture-decision-records).
10. **Every change must be backwards compatible** — see [Backwards Compatibility](#backwards-compatibility).

## Out of Scope for Agents

Do not do these without an explicit human instruction:

- **Do not push, force-push, merge, or close PRs/issues.** Leave the branch; a human pushes.
- **Do not modify branch protection, repository settings, CI credentials, or `.github/workflows/*` release/publish workflows.**
- **Do not touch anything under `distros/kubernetes/nvsentinel/` chart versions or `.versions.yaml`** as a side effect of unrelated work — version bumps are their own change.
- **Do not run `make dev-env`, `e2e-test`, or `kubectl` against a cluster you did not create.** Confirm your kube-context is the local Kind cluster first: `kubectl config current-context` must read `kind-nvsentinel` (defined in `.ctlptl.yaml`). Never run destructive commands against a context you do not recognise.
- **Do not regenerate protobufs, run `go mod tidy`, or reformat files outside the scope of your change** — the diff noise buries the actual change.
- **Do not add a dependency** without saying so; this project ships to customers and every dependency is a supply-chain surface.
- **Do not add `Co-Authored-By` or agent-attribution trailers** to commits.

## Architecture Decision Records

**Read the relevant ADRs before you change behaviour.** They live in [docs/designs/](docs/designs/), numbered `NNN-title.md` — there are more than fifty. They record *why* the system is shaped the way it is, and that reasoning is almost never recoverable from the code alone. A change that looks like an obvious improvement is frequently something that was considered and rejected for a reason still documented there.

**Before changing anything non-trivial:**

1. Scan the index at [docs/designs/README.md](docs/designs/README.md) for records covering the subsystem you are touching, then grep for specifics (`grep -ril "node drainer" docs/designs/`).
2. Read the matching ADR's **Decision**, **Rationale**, and **Alternatives Considered** sections. If your intended approach appears under Alternatives Considered as rejected, do not implement it without addressing the stated reason.
3. Reference the ADR in your PR description when your change touches an area one covers.

**If you believe an ADR's decision is now wrong**, say so explicitly rather than quietly implementing something that contradicts it. Superseding a decision is a legitimate outcome — silently diverging from one is not, because the next reader will find the ADR and the code disagreeing with no explanation of which is current.

**Write a new ADR** when a change introduces a new module or health monitor, changes how modules coordinate, alters a persisted schema or public interface, adds a dependency on an external system, or picks between approaches with long-lived consequences.

- Write it **before** implementing, not as a retroactive justification — the point is to surface the decision while it can still change cheaply.
- Copy [docs/designs/template.md](docs/designs/template.md) and keep its structure: Context, Decision, Implementation, Rationale, Consequences (Positive / Negative / Mitigations), Alternatives Considered, Notes, References.
- Take the next free number and **never reuse one**, even if a record was withdrawn. Numbers are allocated, not contiguous.
- When superseding, leave the old record in place and mark it superseded at the top; name what you supersede in the new record's References. Deleting it destroys the decision trail.
- Add the record to the index table in [docs/designs/README.md](docs/designs/README.md) in the same change.

**Do not edit an existing ADR to describe a new feature.** This is the most common way to damage the record. An ADR captures what was decided and why at the time; rewriting it to cover later work destroys that history and leaves the rationale describing a system that no longer matches it. Adding a feature usually means updating [docs/](docs/) and the configuration reference, not the ADR that happens to mention the subsystem. Write a new record only when your change alters a decision an existing one made — and then supersede it properly rather than editing in place. Fixing a factual error or a broken link in an old record is fine.

**An agent may draft an ADR; a maintainer owns the decision.** Propose it and wait for a human to accept it — do not treat a self-authored ADR as settled and start building against it.

## Backwards Compatibility

**Every change must be backwards compatible.** This is stricter than it sounds, and it is not primarily about end users. NVSentinel modules are deployed independently and upgraded by a rolling Helm release, so during any upgrade **old and new versions of different modules run against each other and against data written by the previous version**. A change that is only self-consistent will break mid-upgrade in a live cluster.

The compatibility surfaces, roughly in order of how easily they break:

| Surface | Rule |
|---|---|
| Protobuf / gRPC (`data-models/`) | Add fields, never renumber, reuse, retype or remove them. A monitor built from the old schema must still talk to the new platform-connectors, and vice versa |
| Event store schema | New code must read events written by the previous version; old code must tolerate events written by the new one. Add optional fields, do not repurpose existing ones |
| Helm values (`distros/kubernetes/`) | Never rename or remove a key that users set. Add new keys with defaults that preserve current behaviour |
| CRDs (`*/api/v1alpha1/`) | Objects already in etcd must still deserialize. Add optional fields; do not remove or retype existing ones |
| Node labels, annotations, conditions | External automation keys off these — e.g. `nvsentinel.dgxc.nvidia.com/kata.enabled`. Treat them as public API |
| Metrics names and labels | Renaming one silently breaks dashboards and alerts |
| CLI flags and environment variables | Keep the old spelling working |

**CI will not catch this for you.** `make protos-lint` only verifies that generated files are up to date — there is no `buf breaking` check, no API-diff gate, and no schema compatibility test. The `v1alpha1` on the CRDs describes their maturity, not permission to break them.

Since nothing gates it, check the surfaces yourself before opening a PR. Derive the paths rather than hardcoding them, so a CRD added later cannot fall outside the check:

```bash
# find, not `ls -d */api/v1alpha1` — that only matches one level deep and
# silently drops nested CRDs such as plugins/slinky-drainer/api/v1alpha1.
SURFACES="data-models distros/kubernetes/nvsentinel/values.yaml $(find . -type d -path '*/api/v1alpha1')"
git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD -- $SURFACES
```

A non-empty diff is a prompt to look, not proof of a break — most changes to these paths are additive. Read the diff and decide. Node labels, metrics and CLI flags are not path-derivable; if you touched any, check those by hand.

**When a break is genuinely necessary**, it is a maintainer decision and needs an ADR. Default to the additive path: add the new field or key alongside the old one, make the old one continue to work, mark it deprecated in docs, and let it be removed in a later release once nothing depends on it.

```go
// BAD - renaming the field breaks every monitor still on the old build
type HealthEvent struct {
    NodeID string `protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=node_id"`  // was node_name
}

// GOOD - add alongside, keep the old field populated and working
type HealthEvent struct {
    NodeName string `protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=node_name"` // deprecated, still populated
    NodeID   string `protobuf:"bytes,7,opt,name=node_id"`
}
```

## Git Configuration

- Branch from and target `main`.
- **Every commit must be DCO signed off**: `git commit -s`. CI enforces this via `.github/dco.yml`; an unsigned commit blocks the merge.
- Commit messages and **PR titles** follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `type(scope): summary` — e.g. `fix(node-drainer): handle nil taint list`. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`. The `scope` is the affected module or component. Nothing in CI enforces this today, so it is on you to get it right.
- **The repo is squash-merge only, and the squash commit body is blank** — the PR title becomes the entire commit message on `main` and cannot be fixed after merge. Spend the effort on the title.

## Secrets and Credentials

**Never commit a secret.** Tokens, API keys, kubeconfigs, cloud service-account JSON, DCGM or NGC credentials, MongoDB/PostgreSQL connection strings with passwords, and private keys do not belong in this repository — not in source, not in test fixtures, not in Helm values, not baked into an image, not in a commit message. That includes values you are only using locally.

**Never paste one where it is recorded.** Issues, pull requests, CI logs, `slog` output and terminal transcripts copied into a report are durable and mostly public. A token in a debug log is a leaked token — redact before pasting.

**Where a secret belongs instead.** Read it at run time from an environment variable or a Kubernetes Secret. Commit the *reference* — the env var name, or the Secret name and key — never the value. Test fixtures use obviously fake values.

**If a secret does get committed, rotate it.** Deleting the file or amending the commit is not a fix: the value is in the git history, in every clone that fetched it, and possibly in CI logs and forks. Revoke and reissue the credential first, then tell a maintainer, then clean the history. Report it even if you believe the commit never left your machine.

## Repository Map

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `health-monitors/` | Fault detection. `gpu-health-monitor` (Python, DCGM), `syslog-health-monitor`, `csp-health-monitor`, `kubernetes-object-monitor` (CEL policies), `nic-health-monitor`, `slurm-drain-monitor`, `nvcre-certification-monitor` |
| `health-events-analyzer/` | Another health monitor — detects patterns across events instead of reading a device. Same gRPC publish path as the rest |

Each Go module is a **separate Go module with its own `go.mod`**, wired together by a Go workspace. Adding a cross-module import means updating `go.mod` replace directives — run `make dependencies-sync` rather than hand-editing.

## Coding Conventions

**Wrap errors with context — except inside retry loops.** This is the single most repo-specific rule here. `retry.RetryOnConflict` inspects the error to decide whether to retry; wrapping hides the conflict and silently breaks the retry:

```go
// BAD - wrapping defeats conflict detection, the retry never fires
err := retry.RetryOnConflict(retry.DefaultBackoff, func() error {
    _, err := client.Update(ctx, obj, metav1.UpdateOptions{})
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to update node: %w", err)
})

// GOOD - return bare inside the retry, wrap outside it
err := retry.RetryOnConflict(retry.DefaultBackoff, func() error {
    _, err := client.Update(ctx, obj, metav1.UpdateOptions{})
    return err
})
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to update node %s: %w", node.Name, err)
}
```

Everywhere else, `return err` bare loses the call site — wrap with `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`.

**Compare errors with `errors.Is`, never `==`.** `errorlint` is enabled and will fail CI, and `==` breaks on wrapped errors:

```go
// BAD - fails errorlint, breaks the moment anything wraps the error
if err == mongo.ErrNoDocuments {

// GOOD
if errors.Is(err, mongo.ErrNoDocuments) {
```

**Log with `slog`, never `fmt.Println`.** Structured key-value pairs, not interpolated strings:

```go
// BAD - unparseable, no severity
fmt.Printf("draining node %s failed: %v\n", name, err)

// GOOD
slog.Error("node drain failed", "node", name, "error", err)
```

**Every outbound call is context-bounded.** `noctx` and `bodyclose` are enabled — an HTTP call without a context, or a response body that is not closed, fails CI.

```go
// BAD - no context, unbounded, body leaked
resp, err := http.Get(url)

// GOOD
req, err := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, http.MethodGet, url, nil)
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("build request: %w", err)
}
resp, err := client.Do(req)
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("get %s: %w", url, err)
}
defer resp.Body.Close()
```

**Prefer informers over polling the API server.** Direct `Get`/`List` in a loop hammers the apiserver at cluster scale; NVSentinel runs on large GPU fleets where that is a real cost. Register event handlers on a shared informer factory and extract handler setup into its own method.

**Other conventions the linters enforce.** `.golangci.yml` enables `wsl_v5` (strict whitespace/statement cuddling), `lll` (line length), `cyclop` and `gocognit` (complexity), `gosec`, `nilerr`, `exhaustive` (switch over enums), `dupl`. When a complexity linter fires, split the function — do not add a `//nolint`. Every source file needs the Apache 2.0 header; `make license-headers-lint` checks it.

**Python** (`gpu-health-monitor`, `dcgm-diag`, `nccl-allreduce`, `log-collector`): Poetry for dependencies, PEP 8, Black for formatting, type hints on all functions.

**Protobuf**: there are two `.proto` trees — `data-models/protobufs/` and `api/proto/` (`device/v1alpha1`, `csp/v1alpha1`). Edit either and run `make protos-generate`, which drives both. Never hand-edit generated code — CI diffs the regenerated output and fails on drift.

## Documentation Style

**Write in [ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English](https://www.asd-ste100.org/).** It keeps documentation clear for every reader, including the many whose first language is not English. In practice:

- One idea per sentence. Keep instructions under 20 words and descriptions under 25.
- Active voice with a clear actor: "the drainer evicts the pod", not "the pod is evicted".
- One word, one meaning. Pick a term and reuse it — a node is *cordoned*, never variously "cordoned", "blocked" or "fenced".
- Simple, common words. Prefer "use" over "utilise", "before" over "prior to", "start" over "initiate".
- Say what to do, not what to avoid, unless the hazard is the point.

This is a house style for prose, not a linter. Do not mangle a precise technical term to satisfy it.

**Keep any single document under 15 minutes of reading**, roughly 3000 words of prose. Past that, readers skim and stop finding things. Split by topic into documents that each stand alone, and link between them — one long page is harder to use than four short ones. Reference material that grows without bound (a command catalogue, a troubleshooting matrix) belongs in its own file from the start.

**Do not hard-wrap prose.** Write each paragraph, list item and table row as one long line and let the editor soft-wrap it. Hard wrapping at a fixed column makes every later edit reflow the whole paragraph, so a one-word change shows up as a five-line diff and review comments anchor to the wrong line.

```markdown
<!-- BAD - rewording the first clause reflows all three lines -->
The node drainer evicts workloads from a quarantined node. It respects
pod disruption budgets and will not evict pods that have no
controller managing them.

<!-- GOOD - a reworded sentence is a one-line diff -->
The node drainer evicts workloads from a quarantined node. It respects pod disruption budgets and will not evict pods that have no controller managing them.
```

This applies to new files and to sections you add. When editing a file that is already hard-wrapped throughout — `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, for instance, which carries upstream Contributor Covenant text — match the surrounding style rather than leaving one reflowed paragraph in an otherwise wrapped document.

Also: fenced code blocks need a language (` ```bash `, ` ```go `, ` ```text ` for diagrams), and blank lines go before and after headings, lists and fences.

## Testing

**Use `envtest`, not fake clients, for anything touching the Kubernetes API.** Fake clients do not enforce validation, admission, or optimistic concurrency, so they pass while the real thing fails — which for this project means a drain bug that only shows up in a live cluster.

CRDs live in the Helm charts, not a separate `config/crd` tree — point `envtest` at the chart:

```go
testEnv := &envtest.Environment{
    CRDDirectoryPaths: []string{
        filepath.Join("..", "..", "..", "distros", "kubernetes", "nvsentinel", "charts", "janitor", "crds"),
    },
}
cfg, err := testEnv.Start()
require.NoError(t, err)
defer testEnv.Stop()
```

- `testify/require` to stop on failure, `testify/assert` to continue.
- Table-driven tests whenever there is more than one case.
- Name tests `TestFunctionName_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior`.
- Tests run with `-race`; a data race is a failure, not a flake.
- Aim for >80% coverage on critical paths — remediation and drain logic especially.

**Never wait with `time.Sleep`.** A fixed sleep is either longer than necessary, which slows the suite, or shorter than the machine needs, which produces a flake that only appears in CI. Poll for the condition instead:

```go
// BAD - passes on a fast machine, flakes on a loaded CI runner
time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
require.True(t, node.Spec.Unschedulable)

// GOOD - waits only as long as needed, fails with a clear timeout
require.Eventually(t, func() bool {
    require.NoError(t, c.Get(ctx, key, node))
    return node.Spec.Unschedulable
}, 30*time.Second, 100*time.Millisecond)
```

Use `require.Never` for the inverse — proving a node is *not* cordoned when it should not be. That pairing matters here: remediation code needs a test showing it does not fire in the healthy case, and `require.Never` is how you write it.

## Anti-Patterns

Everything the rule sections above cover is authoritative and not repeated here.

| Anti-pattern | Correct approach |
|---|---|
| Editing generated protobuf `.pb.go` files | Edit the `.proto`, run `make protos-generate` |
| Adding a `Dockerfile` to a Go module | Go images are built by `ko` — no Dockerfile needed |
| `//nolint` to silence a complexity or gosec finding | Fix the finding; split the function or handle the case |
| Fake Kubernetes client in a controller test | `envtest` — see Testing above |
| Polling `client.Get` in a loop | Informer with event handlers |
| Wrapping the error inside `retry.RetryOnConflict` | Return bare inside, wrap outside |
| Hardcoding a tool or image version in a script | Read it from `.versions.yaml` |
| Swallowing an error with `_ =` or a bare `continue` | Handle it, or `slog.Warn` with the error and say why continuing is safe |
| Broad refactor bundled into a bug fix | Separate PRs — this repo squash-merges, so the fix and the refactor become one unreviewable commit |
| Assuming MongoDB | The store is pluggable; PostgreSQL is a supported backend and is covered in the E2E matrix |
| Implementing an approach an ADR already rejected | Read `docs/designs/` first; if the rejection no longer holds, say so and propose superseding the ADR |
| Treating `health-events-analyzer` as a distinct pipeline stage | It is a health monitor like any other — same gRPC publish path |
| Renaming a proto field, Helm value, metric, or node label | Add the new one alongside; keep the old working. Nothing in CI catches this |
| Adding retry/fallback around an internal call "just in case" | Only add retries where a real transient failure exists; invented resilience hides bugs |

## Pull Request Requirements

**Before opening a PR:**

1. `make lint-test-all` passes locally. This is the closest local equivalent of the CI gate; a subset is not a substitute.
2. Every commit is signed off (`git commit -s`).
3. The PR title is a Conventional Commit — it becomes the whole commit message on `main`.
4. Fill in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` as defined; do not inline a modified copy.
5. Update docs in the same PR for any user-visible change — a new Helm value, CLI flag, metric, label, or CRD field. Helm values are documented inline in `values.yaml`.

**Merge gate on `main`** (enforced, not advisory): 1 approving review, all required status checks green (every module's lint-test plus the full E2E matrix across AMD64/ARM64 and MongoDB/Percona/PostgreSQL), branch up to date with `main`, linear history, and all review conversations resolved. Pushing new commits dismisses stale approvals, so batch your responses to review rather than pushing one commit per comment.

**Non-trivial changes start with an issue, and the issue carries the detail.** Open it before writing code, and make it stand on its own: what the problem is, how to reproduce it or why the feature is needed, the affected component, and the intended approach. A reviewer should be able to judge whether the approach is right from the issue alone, before any diff exists — that is the point of going issue-first, and it is where an approach gets corrected cheaply.

Trivial fixes — a typo, a broken link, a stale command — do not need one. If you are unsure, open the issue; a redundant issue costs nothing next to a rewritten PR. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full workflow and the review process.

| Informer never syncs | RBAC — the ServiceAccount is probably missing a watch verb |
| `envtest` fails to start | `make dev-env-setup`; `setup-envtest` binaries missing |
| Lint passes locally, fails in CI | You ran a module target, not `make lint-test-all` — protos, license headers and gomod checks are top-level only |
| Protobuf CI failure with no source change | Generated files are stale; run `make protos-generate` and commit the result |
| `go build` fails after a cross-module change | `make dependencies-sync` — replace directives are out of date |
| Tilt not picking up changes | `make dev-restart` |
| Node not being remediated in E2E | Check the event store first — the event may never have been persisted |

## Decision Framework

When approaches conflict, prioritise in this order:

1. **Safety** — does the failure mode take down healthy nodes? Fail closed.
2. **Testability** — can it be tested without a real GPU or a real cloud account?
3. **Consistency** — does it match the sibling module?
4. **Readability** — will the next on-call engineer understand it at 3am?
5. **Simplicity** — is it the smallest thing that works?
