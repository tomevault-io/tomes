# Check MongoDB Migration Readiness

## When to use

Use this skill **before** `migrate-mongodb-to-percona`. Nothing in this skill
mutates the cluster.

The procedure it gates is documented in
`docs/runbooks/mongodb-bitnami-to-percona-migration.md` (the source of truth).

## Inputs

- `NVSENTINEL_NAMESPACE` (default `nvsentinel`)
- `NVSENTINEL_RELEASE` (default `nvsentinel`)
- `MIGRATION_PVC_SIZE_GI` (default `8`): the volume size the Percona install
  will request. Set it to the value from the operator's planned values file
  so the storage check validates the real request.

## Setup

```bash
export NVSENTINEL_NAMESPACE="nvsentinel"
export NVSENTINEL_RELEASE="nvsentinel"
export MIGRATION_PVC_SIZE_GI="8"
```

## Steps

1. Run the preflight script and show the operator the full table:

   ```bash
   scripts/mongodb-migration/preflight.sh
   ```

2. Interpret the verdict:
   - Exit `2` (`BLOCKED`): stop. Explain each FAIL row and propose the fix,
     but do NOT execute mutations inside this skill (it is read-only by
     contract); the operator applies fixes, then re-run the preflight. Typical blockers: a failed/pending Helm release, both
     backends present (mixed state; see the runbook troubleshooting table),
     cert-manager missing, or the default StorageClass minimum above the
     requested volume size (OCI block volumes have a 50Gi minimum; the
     Percona operator wedges before replica set init when the provisioned
     volume is larger than requested).
   - Exit `0` with REVIEW rows: each REVIEW row is an operator decision,
     not yours. Do not proceed until each is acknowledged in conversation.

3. Capture the decisions the migration skill needs:
   - **Data handling:** the preserve path (dump and restore) is the
     DEFAULT: document IDs are preserved, node annotations and remediation
     resources stay valid, and in-flight fault handling resumes after the
     restore. It requires scaling fault-quarantine, node-drainer, and
     fault-remediation to zero before the dump, so no references get
     created for events the archive will not contain; capture that as part
     of the plan. The clean path (no dump, all health event data lost) is
     the opt-out: one-time faults such as GPU XIDs are never re-detected
     on it, so the operator must explicitly choose it.
   - **Quarantined nodes:** record the list from the REVIEW row. With the
     clean path the operator must decide per node: remediate first, keep
     cordoned for manual review, or return to service.
   - **GitOps:** ask whether ArgoCD/Flux manages the installation. If yes,
     reconciliation must be suspended before the migration and the desired
     state in git updated before resuming (runbook steps 2, 4a and 6a).
   - **Chart reference:** record which chart and version the installation
     currently runs (from the Application spec, HelmRelease, or
     `helm list`), so the migration redeploys the SAME chart version with
     new values instead of silently upgrading NVSentinel.

## Output

Report to the operator:

- verdict (`READY` / `READY with review items` / `BLOCKED`)
- the chosen data-handling path
- the recorded quarantined-node list (or "none")
- whether GitOps suspension is required
- the values changes the install will need (backend flags, volume size,
  scheduling keys)
- the chart reference and version to redeploy (`CHART_REF` for the
  migration skill)

## Next skill to run

- `migrate-mongodb-to-percona` (only on `READY`, with the decisions above
  captured)
