# Verify MongoDB Percona Migration

## When to use

Use this skill **after** `migrate-mongodb-to-percona`, or standalone to
health-check a Percona-backed installation.

Hard gate for step 2: the restore is a mutating operation. Run it ONLY when
this skill is part of a migration run started by the readiness and migration
skills AND the operator has confirmed, in this conversation, the specific
archive file to restore. In standalone health-check mode, steps 2 and 3 are
always skipped: never restore an archive into an installation as part of a
health check.

## Inputs

- `NVSENTINEL_NAMESPACE` (default `nvsentinel`)
- `DATA_PATH` (`restore` is the default, `clean` is the opt-out) and
  `ARCHIVE` (restore path only), carried over from the migration skill

## Setup

```bash
export NVSENTINEL_NAMESPACE="nvsentinel"
```

## Steps

1. **Run the gates:**

   ```bash
   scripts/mongodb-migration/verify.sh
   ```

   Five gates: psmdb resource `ready`, initialization job `Complete`, mongod
   pods ready, `MONGODB_URI` pointing at `mongodb-rs0`, and EVERY deployed
   datastore consumer (health-events-analyzer, fault-quarantine,
   node-drainer, fault-remediation) logging `Successfully pinged`. All five
   must pass; the script fails gate five when no consumer exists at all,
   because connectivity cannot be confirmed. On the restore path this gate
   matters doubly: fault-quarantine and health-events-analyzer only see
   restored events through their live change streams, so every consumer
   must be healthy BEFORE the restore runs. Timeouts are tunable
   via `VERIFY_CR_TIMEOUT`, `VERIFY_JOB_TIMEOUT`, `VERIFY_POD_TIMEOUT`,
   `VERIFY_PING_RETRIES`. A consumer stuck in `CrashLoopBackOff` with old
   restart counts may just be in backoff from the bring-up window; delete
   the pod to skip the backoff before diagnosing.

2. **Restore (only within a migration run on the preserve path, with the
   archive confirmed by the operator; skipped on the clean path and always
   skipped in standalone health-check mode):**

   All gates from step 1 must have passed first, so every consumer is
   running and streaming when the restored documents arrive.

   ```bash
   scripts/mongodb-migration/migrate-data.sh restore <ARCHIVE>
   ```

   The script exits 3 (refused) if any deployed consumer is not ready; that
   means a consumer went unready since the gates ran, so go back to step 1
   rather than overriding. The consumers stay up during the restore on
   purpose: fault-quarantine and health-events-analyzer process the restored
   events through their live change streams as the inserts happen.

   Then restart the datastore consumers, so node-drainer and
   fault-remediation also re-query for unfinished events on startup:

   ```bash
   for D in health-events-analyzer fault-quarantine node-drainer fault-remediation; do
     kubectl get deploy "$D" -n "$NVSENTINEL_NAMESPACE" >/dev/null 2>&1 && \
       kubectl rollout restart deploy "$D" -n "$NVSENTINEL_NAMESPACE"
   done
   ```

   The loop restarts only the deployments that exist in this installation.
   Rollout restarts are not spec changes, so they create no GitOps drift.

3. **Restore continuity checks (restore path only):**
   - Quarantined nodes are still cordoned and their `quarantineHealthEvent`
     annotations reference documents that exist in the new datastore.
   - node-drainer logs show NO repeating
     `unexpected number of events for node ...` lines (that loop means an
     annotation references a missing document).
   - `ResumeTokens` contains only freshly written tokens (the restore never
     carries the old ones).

4. **Aftermath.** Walk the operator through what to expect either way:
   - Restore path (default): the event exporter has no resume token, so it
     re-exports every restored event to its sink; warn the downstream
     owners about duplicates. Restored quarantine state is latent until
     the next event or cold start touches the node. There is NO CSP
     maintenance replay, because the restored maintenance events preserve
     the watermark.
   - Clean path: the CSP health monitor re-ingests provider maintenance
     events still visible in the provider API (its watermark lived in the
     wiped database); expect one polling cycle of replay. One-time faults
     (GPU XIDs) are not re-detected; the operator must work through the
     quarantined-node list recorded during readiness. Persistent faults
     are re-detected on the next monitoring cycle.

## Output

Report to the operator:

- the verify.sh verdict table
- restore performed or skipped, and the continuity check results
- the aftermath items that apply to this installation

## Next skill to run

None; the migration is complete when all gates pass and, on the restore
path, the continuity checks hold. If a gate fails, the failure-branch table
in `migrate-mongodb-to-percona` and the runbook troubleshooting table are
the recovery references.
