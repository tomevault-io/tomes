This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this
repository.

## Project Overview

A modern, type-safe, async Python library for controlling LIFX smart devices over the local network.
Built with Python's built-in `asyncio` for async/await patterns and features auto-generated protocol
structures from a YAML specification. Published on PyPI as `lifx-async` (`pip install lifx-async`).

**Python Versions**: 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14 (tested on all versions via CI)
**Runtime Dependencies**: Zero - completely dependency-free!
**Async Framework**: Python's built-in `asyncio` (no external async library required)
**Test Isolation**: lifx-emulator-core runs embedded in-process for fast, cross-platform testing

## Essential Commands

### Development Setup

```bash
# Sync all dependencies (including dev)
uv sync

# Install only the core library (zero dependencies)
uv sync --no-dev
```

### Adding a dependency

```bash
# Add a runtime dependency (use sparingly - library is currently dependency-free!)
uv add some-package

# Add a development dependency
uv add --dev pytest-cov
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run --frozen pytest

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_devices/test_light.py -v

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=lifx --cov-report=html

# Verbose output
uv run --frozen pytest -v

# Run with emulator integration tests (requires lifx-emulator on PATH)
# Tests marked with @pytest.mark.emulator will be skipped if emulator is not available
uv run pytest
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
uv run ruff format .

# Lint with auto-fix
uv run ruff check . --fix

# Type check (Pyright, standard mode)
uv run pyright
```

### Protocol Update

```bash
# Source: https://github.com/LIFX/public-protocol/blob/main/protocol.yml
# Regenerate Python protocol code
uv run python -m lifx.protocol.generator
```

### Products Registry Update

```bash
# Source: https://github.com/LIFX/products/blob/master/products.json
# Regenerate Python product registry
uv run python -m lifx.products.generator
```

### Theme Data Update

```bash
# Source: data/themes.jsonl (committed; no network, no device required)
# Regenerate the theme data module
uv run scripts/generate_theme_data.py
```

The generator lives in `scripts/`, not the package: its input sits outside `src/` and is
deliberately not shipped in the wheel. CI regenerates and diffs `src/lifx/theme/data.py`
on every change to `data/**`.

### Documentation

```bash
# Serve documentation locally with hot reload
uv run zensical serve

# Build static documentation
uv run zensical build
uv run llmstxt-standalone build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages via the Documentation workflow
gh workflow run docs.yml
```

## Architecture

### Layered Architecture (Bottom-Up)

1. **Protocol Layer** (`src/lifx/protocol/`)

   - Auto-generated from `protocol.yml` using `generator.py`
   - `protocol_types.py`: Enums and field structures (HSBK, TileStateDevice, etc.)
   - `packets.py`: Packet classes with PKT_TYPE constants
   - `header.py`: LIFX protocol header (36 bytes)
   - `serializer.py`: Binary serialization/deserialization
   - `models.py`: Protocol data models (`Serial` dataclass, HEV types)
   - `base.py`: Base classes for protocol structures
   - **Focus on lighting**: Button and Relay items are automatically filtered during generation (not
     relevant for light control)
   - **Never edit generated files manually** - download updated `protocol.yml` from LIFX official
     repo instead

2. **Network Layer** (`src/lifx/network/`)

   - `transport.py`: UDP transport using asyncio
   - `discovery.py`: Device discovery via broadcast with `DiscoveredDevice` dataclass
   - `connection.py`: Device connection with retry logic and lazy opening
   - `message.py`: Message building and parsing with `MessageBuilder`
   - `mdns/`: mDNS/DNS-SD discovery module (zero-dependency, stdlib only)
     - `discovery.py`: `discover_lifx_services()` and `discover_devices_mdns()`
     - `dns.py`: DNS wire format parser for PTR, SRV, A, TXT records
     - `transport.py`: `MdnsTransport` class for multicast UDP
     - `types.py`: `LifxServiceRecord` dataclass
   - Lazy connection opening (auto-opens on first request)

3. **Device Layer** (`src/lifx/devices/`)

   - `base.py`: Base `Device` class with common operations: `from_ip()`, label, power, version, info
   - `light.py`: `Light` class (color control, effects: pulse, breathe, waveforms)
   - `hev.py`: `HevLight` class (Light with HEV anti-bacterial cleaning cycle control)
   - `infrared.py`: `InfraredLight` class (Light with infrared LED control for night vision)
   - `multizone.py`: `MultiZoneLight` for strips/beams (zone-based color control)
   - `matrix.py`: `MatrixLight` for matrix devices (2D pixel control: tiles, candle, path)
   - `ceiling.py`: `CeilingLight` class (extends `MatrixLight` with independent uplight/downlight component control for LIFX Ceiling products)
   - State caching with configurable TTL to reduce network traffic

4. **High-Level API** (`src/lifx/api.py`)

   - `discover()`: Async generator yielding devices via UDP broadcast
   - `discover_mdns()`: Async generator yielding devices via mDNS (faster, single query)
   - `find_by_serial()`: Find specific device by serial number
   - `find_by_label()`: Async generator yielding devices matching label (exact or substring)
   - `find_by_ip()`: Find device by IP address using targeted broadcast
   - `DeviceGroup`: Batch operations (set_power, set_color, etc.)
   - `LocationGrouping` / `GroupGrouping`: Organizational structures for location/group-based grouping

5. **Animation Layer** (`src/lifx/animation/`)

   - `animator.py`: High-level `Animator` class with direct UDP sending
   - `flow.py`: Ack-gated flow control
   - `framebuffer.py`: Multi-tile canvas mapping and orientation correction
   - `packets.py`: Prebaked packet templates (`MatrixPacketGenerator`, `MultiZonePacketGenerator`)
   - `orientation.py`: Tile orientation remapping with LRU-cached lookup tables
   - Optimised for high-frequency frame delivery (up to ~20 FPS) for real-time effects
   - Uses protocol-ready uint16 HSBK values (no conversion overhead)
   - Multi-tile canvas support using `user_x`/`user_y` tile positions

6. **Effects Layer** (`src/lifx/effects/`)

   - 26 built-in effects (aurora, flame, plasma, rainbow, twinkle, etc.)
   - `base.py`: Base effect class with frame generation interface
   - `registry.py`: Effect registry for discovering available effects by name
   - `state_manager.py`: Effect state management for running effects on devices
   - `models.py`: Shared effect models and configuration types
   - Effects generate HSBK frames consumed by the Animation Layer

7. **Theme Layer** (`src/lifx/theme/`)

   - `theme.py`: Theme definitions (named color palettes); `palette_equals()` compares
     palettes as an unordered multiset — `==` is identity, so `Theme` stays hashable
   - `library.py`: Built-in theme library, reading the generated dict alone
   - `data.py`: Auto-generated theme records (166 themes, 168 resolvable keys) — **never
     edit manually**; regenerate from `data/themes.jsonl`
   - `generators.py`: Theme-based color generators for effects
   - `canvas.py`: Canvas abstraction for applying themes to device layouts

8. **Utilities**

   - `color.py`: `HSBK` class with RGB conversion, `Colors` presets
   - `const.py`: Critical constants (network settings, UUIDs, official URLs)
   - `exceptions.py`: Exception hierarchy (see Exception Hierarchy section below)
   - `products/`: Product registry module
     - `products/__init__.py`: Public API exports
     - `products/registry.py`: Auto-generated product database (from products.json)
     - `products/generator.py`: Generator to download and parse products.json

### Device Capabilities Matrix

Different LIFX device types support different features:

| Device Type | Color | Multizone | Matrix | Infrared | HEV | Variable Temperature | Ceiling Components |
|-------------|-------|-----------|--------|----------|-----|----------------------|--------------------|
| Device      | ❌    | ❌        | ❌     | ❌       | ❌  | ❌                   | ❌                 |
| Light       | ✅    | ❌        | ❌     | ❌       | ❌  | ✅                   | ❌                 |
| InfraredLight | ✅  | ❌        | ❌     | ✅       | ❌  | ✅                   | ❌                 |
| HevLight    | ✅    | ❌        | ❌     | ❌       | ✅  | ✅                   | ❌                 |
| MultiZoneLight | ✅ | ✅        | ❌     | ❌       | ❌  | ✅                   | ❌                 |
| MatrixLight | ✅    | ❌        | ✅     | ❌       | ❌  | ✅                   | ❌                 |
| CeilingLight | ✅   | ❌        | ✅     | ❌       | ❌  | ✅                   | ✅                 |

**Device Detection**: The `products` registry automatically detects device capabilities based on
product ID and instantiates the appropriate device class.

### Exception Hierarchy

All exceptions inherit from `LifxError` (`src/lifx/exceptions.py`): `LifxDeviceNotFoundError`, `LifxTimeoutError`, `LifxProtocolError`, `LifxConnectionError`, `LifxNetworkError`, `LifxUnsupportedCommandError`.

### Key Design Patterns

- **Async Context Managers**: All devices and connections use `async with` for automatic cleanup
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints, validated with Pyright (standard mode)
- **Auto-Generation**: Protocol structures generated from YAML specification
- **State Caching**: Device properties cache values to reduce network requests
- **Lazy Connections**: Connections open automatically on first request
- **Async Generator Streaming**: Request/response communication via async generators

### State Caching

- Cached (semi-static): `label`, `version`, `host_firmware`, `wifi_firmware`, `location`, `group`, `hev_config`, `hev_result`, `zone_count`, `multizone_effect`, `tile_chain`, `tile_count`, `tile_effect`
- **Never cached** (volatile): `power`, `color`, `hev_cycle`, `zones`, `tile_colors`, `ambient_light_level` — always use `get_*()` methods
- **Opt-in state fields**: `wifi_info` (signal/rssi) and `ambient_light` are only queried when the matching `fetch_wifi_info` / `fetch_ambient_light` flag is on. Both default to off, are settable as constructor arguments *and* as device properties (toggling applies from the next initialization or refresh), join the same parallel batch as the other state requests, and leave their field `None` while disabled (a refresh with the flag off clears the field rather than leaving a stale reading). Both are keyword-only dataclass fields with defaults, so adding them stayed additive for existing state constructors. An ambient reading taken while the light is on is stored as `INVALID_AMBIENT_LIGHT_RESPONSE` (-1.0) because the sensor measures the light's own output. A request that fails outright logs a warning and leaves the field `None` instead of failing state initialization. `get_wifi_info()` / `get_ambient_light_level()` remain the single-request way to read either on demand.
- `get_color()` returns `(color, power, label)` in a single request/response pair — most efficient way to get color + power
- No automatic expiration — application controls when to refresh

## Common Patterns

> **Full API docs, usage examples, and device-specific guides are available at
> https://djelibeybi.github.io/lifx-async/ and via context7 (`/djelibeybi/lifx-async`, 549 snippets).**
> The following covers only non-obvious gotchas not in the docs.

### Key Gotchas

- **Serial vs MAC**: Serial number usually matches MAC address. The one exception is firmware with `version_major == 3 and version_minor >= 70`, whose MAC is the serial with the final octet incremented (wrapping at 256). Both components are compared as integers — minor `9` is *below* minor `70`, so treating the version as a decimal misclassifies 3.9. Earlier 3.x builds (e.g. 3.50) match their serial. MAC calculation logic is in `devices/base.py`; `scripts/serial_mac_audit.py` audits the rule against real hardware via the ARP table.
- **HSBK dual formats**: User-facing `HSBK` uses float (hue 0-360, sat/bright 0.0-1.0, kelvin 1500-9000). Protocol/animation layer uses raw uint16 (0-65535 for H/S/B). Don't mix them.
- **Kelvin 0 is a wire value**: 1500-9000 (`MIN_KELVIN`/`MAX_KELVIN`) is the product's white-mode range, not the protocol's. Firmware reports `KELVIN_SATURATED` (0) for a colour with no white component, so `validate_kelvin()` accepts 0 alongside 1500-9000 and never clamps it — clamping would send back a colour the device never reported. All eight `HSBK.from_protocol()` call sites are inbound reads; validators reached from an inbound path must not apply user-input rules (see `MatrixEffect(from_device=True)`, which skips send-time validation and default-filling in `get_effect()`).
- **`user_x`/`user_y` are not pixels**: A chain reports tile positions in tile-position units where 1.0 is always **8 pixels** — the width of the original Tile — regardless of the reporting tile's own size. Photons proves the constant twice: `rearrange.py` lays parts out with `user_x += part.width / 8`, and the arranger converts a dragged pixel back with `new_user_x / 8`. Scaling by the tile's own width instead is wrong for any mixed-geometry chain. `user_y` also grows **upwards** while canvas rows grow downwards, so it must be negated. One helper owns both rules — `lifx/geometry.py` (`TILE_POSITION_UNIT_PIXELS`, `tile_position_to_pixels()`, `tile_origin_pixels()`) — used by `MatrixLight.apply_theme()`, `MatrixGenerator.from_tiles()` and `FrameBuffer._for_multi_tile()`. It rounds where photons truncates, deliberately: the value only picks a canvas pixel and never goes on the wire. Halves round away from zero rather than to even (builtin `round()` is banker's rounding and would collapse two tiles a pixel apart onto one origin). Tile *sizes* are equally not-8x8 — Candle is 5x6, Ceiling reports 16x8 — so `Canvas.add_points_for_tile()` and `Canvas.points_for_tile()` require explicit width/height and have no defaults. `Canvas` is an internal rendering primitive: it is importable but deliberately absent from `lifx.theme.__all__` and the published API docs, so its signatures can change without a major version.
- **`get_color()` returns a triple**: `(color, power, label)` — most efficient single-request way to get color + power state
- **Ambient light sensor**: Every product answers `SensorGetAmbientLight` (401), so the query never fails on an unsupported device. It returns 0.0 for "no sensor", "sensor unreadable" *and* "complete darkness" — the three are indistinguishable from the response, and the product registry has no ambient-sensor capability flag either. Light must be off for accurate readings; state readings taken with the light on are stored as `INVALID_AMBIENT_LIGHT_RESPONSE` (-1.0).
- **UDP endpoint death vs peer errors**: On an unconnected datagram socket asyncio reports *all* send/receive `OSError`s (EHOSTDOWN, EHOSTUNREACH, ENETUNREACH, and even EBADF) to `error_received`, and only calls `connection_lost` for `close()`, `abort()` and fatal non-OSError errors — verified on both stdlib asyncio and uvloop. So peer-unreachable storms must never tear the socket down, while EBADF/ENOTSOCK must (`_FATAL_SOCKET_ERRNOS` in `network/transport.py`). `_UdpProtocol` reports death to `UdpTransport._endpoint_lost()`, which clears `_transport`/`_protocol` so `is_open` tells the truth; `DeviceConnection._ensure_open()` then rebuilds on the next request. Ordinary timeouts must not trigger a rebuild.
- **High-frequency updates**: Use the Animation Layer (`src/lifx/animation/`) for performance-critical frame delivery rather than calling device methods directly.
- **Packet flow**: Create packet → `DeviceConnection.request()` → response auto-unpacked

### Concurrency Considerations

- Concurrent requests on a single connection are supported: a background receiver task routes each response to its request via per-request queues keyed by (source, sequence, serial), so responses never mix
- Different devices have different connections, so operations on multiple devices execute in parallel via `asyncio.TaskGroup`
- Request/response uses async generators: single-response requests break after first response, multi-response requests stream until timeout or early exit
- Sequence numbers (0-255, uint8) are atomically allocated per request for response correlation
- **No rate limiting** built in — devices handle ~20 msg/sec; application developers should implement their own if needed

**Discovery DoS Protection:**

The `discover_devices()` function implements DoS protection through:
- **Source ID validation** - Rejects responses with mismatched source IDs
- **Serial validation** - Rejects invalid/broadcast serial numbers
- **Overall timeout** - Discovery stops after timeout seconds (default: 15.0)
- **Idle timeout** - Discovery stops when no responses are received for ~4 seconds (max_response_time × idle_timeout_multiplier). The window measures network silence, not wall time: it is reset again when the consumer resumes the generator, so time spent inside the `async for` body is excluded. The overall timeout bounds a slow consumer — and since one request's wall deadline (16 s) exceeds the default discovery window (15 s), an unreachable device can still end a default-timeout sweep via that overall deadline.

## Testing Strategy

- **2425+ tests total** (comprehensive coverage across all layers)
- **Protocol Layer**: 159 tests (serialization, header, packets, generator validation)
- **Network Layer**: 183 tests (transport, discovery, connection, message, mDNS, async generator requests)
- **Device Layer**: 375 tests (base, light, ceiling, hev, infrared, multizone, matrix, state management, MAC address)
- **API Layer**: 63 tests (discovery, batch operations, organization, themes, error handling)
- **Effects Layer**: 1249 tests (26 built-in effects, registry, state manager, integration, capability filtering)
- **Theme Layer**: 345 tests (themes, canvas, generators, library, apply_theme, data generator)
- **Animation Layer**: 123 tests (animator, framebuffer, packets, orientation)
- **Utilities**: 127 tests (color conversion, product registry, RGB roundtrip)

### Integration Tests with lifx-emulator-core

Some tests require `lifx-emulator-core` to run integration tests against real protocol implementations.
The emulator runs **embedded in-process** as a dev dependency, providing:
- Fast startup (~5-10ms vs 500ms+ for subprocess)
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Direct access to emulator internals for scenario testing

**Setup**: The emulator is automatically installed as a dev dependency:
```bash
uv sync  # Installs lifx-emulator-core automatically
```

**Running Integration Tests**:
- Tests marked with `@pytest.mark.emulator` use the embedded emulator
- If emulator is not available, these tests are automatically skipped
- **Works on all supported Python versions (3.10+)**

**External Emulator Management**:

For cases where you want to manage the emulator separately (or test against actual hardware):

```bash
# Use an externally managed emulator instance
LIFX_EMULATOR_EXTERNAL=1 LIFX_EMULATOR_PORT=56700 pytest

# Test against actual LIFX hardware on the default port
LIFX_EMULATOR_EXTERNAL=1 pytest
```

This is useful when:
- Testing against actual LIFX hardware on your network
- Running the emulator with custom configuration or device setup
- Debugging emulator behavior separately from the test suite

**Key Test Directories:**

Test files mirror source structure: `tests/test_devices/test_light.py` tests `src/lifx/devices/light.py`

## Protocol Specification

The `protocol.yml` file is the **source of truth** from the official LIFX repository:

- **Source**: https://github.com/LIFX/public-protocol/blob/main/protocol.yml
- **DO NOT modify locally** - download updates from the official repository
- **NOT stored in repo** - downloaded on-demand by generator and parsed in-memory
- Defines: types, enums, fields, compound_fields, and packets with pkt_type/category
- Local quirks are allowed in generator.py to make the result more Pythonic

The file structure:

- **types**: Basic types (uint8, uint16, etc.)
- **enums**: Protocol enums (LightWaveform, Service, etc.)
- **fields**: Reusable field structures (HSBK, Rect)
- **compound_fields**: Complex nested structures (TileStateDevice)
- **packets**: Message definitions with pkt_type and category

Local generator quirks:

- **field name quirks**: Rename fields to avoid Python built-ins and improve readability:
  - `type` -> `effect_type` (type is a Python built-in; effect_type is more semantic for effect fields)
  - Field mappings preserve protocol names: `MultiZoneEffectSettings.effect_type` maps to protocol field `Type`
- **underscores**: Remove underscore from category names but maintain camel case so multi_zone
  becomes MultiZone
- **filtering**: Automatically skips Button and Relay items during generation:
  - Enums starting with "Button" or "Relay" are excluded
  - Fields starting with "Button" or "Relay" are excluded
  - Unions starting with "Button" or "Relay" are excluded
  - All packets in "button" and "relay" categories are excluded
  - This keeps the library focused on LIFX lighting devices
- **FirmwareEffect merge**: `MultiZoneEffectType` and `TileEffectType` are merged into one
  `FirmwareEffect` enum, because both use the same firmware effect protocol values. The members are
  **listed explicitly** in `apply_firmware_effect_enum_quirk()` rather than derived from
  protocol.yml, so an effect type added upstream is dropped silently until it is added there —
  exactly what happened to `COLOR_SWEEP` (6), added in protocol.yml 0.10. Check `TileEffectType` and
  `MultiZoneEffectType` after every regeneration; `test_generated.py::test_firmware_effect_enum`
  pins the full member set so a lost value fails the suite.
- **sensor packets**: No longer a quirk. `SensorGetAmbientLight` (401) and
  `SensorStateAmbientLight` (402) were absent from protocol.yml and added locally by
  `apply_sensor_packet_quirks()`; LIFX have since accepted them upstream, so the quirk was removed
  and both now come straight from the spec. `tests/test_protocol/test_generated.py` asserts their
  packet types and field structure against the generated code, so an upstream regression fails the
  suite rather than silently dropping them.

Run `uv run python -m lifx.protocol.generator` to regenerate Python code.

## Products Registry

- **Source**: https://github.com/LIFX/products/blob/master/products.json
- **Auto-generated**: `src/lifx/products/registry.py` — update with `uv run python -m lifx.products.generator`
- **Key functions**: `get_product(product_id)` → `ProductInfo`, `get_device_class_name(product_id)` → class name string

**Device Type Detection** (`DiscoveredDevice.create_device()` is the single source of truth):
1. Ceiling product ID → `CeilingLight`
2. Matrix capability → `MatrixLight`
3. Multizone → `MultiZoneLight`
4. Infrared → `InfraredLight`
5. HEV → `HevLight`
6. Color → `Light`
7. Relay/Button-only → `None` (filtered out)

## Known Limitations

- Button/Relay/Switch devices are explicitly out of scope (library focuses on lighting devices)
- Never update docs/changelog.md manually as it is auto-generated during the release process by the CI/CD workflow.
- If a field is user-visible, it must never be bytes. This means things like serial, label, location and group must always be converted to a string prior to storing it anywhere a user would be able to access it. Conversion to and from bytes should happen either as close to sending or receiving the packet as possible.
