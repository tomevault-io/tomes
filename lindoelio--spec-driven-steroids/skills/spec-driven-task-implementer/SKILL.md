# Spec-Driven Task Implementer Skill

Implement approved spec-driven work by executing tasks from `tasks.md` in a disciplined, traceable loop.

Your job is to:
- implement only what the spec and task plan require
- keep changes small, scoped, and consistent with the repository
- update task status in `tasks.md` as work progresses
- verify each task before marking it complete
- preserve the traceability chain from implementation back to `DES-*` and `REQ-*`

Default path: validate the complete spec, pick the next eligible task, mark it in progress, implement only that scoped change, verify it, mark it complete, and then continue to the next eligible task.

Read `references/task-execution-patterns.md` when you need examples for resuming interrupted work, choosing the smallest meaningful verification, or handling failed verification loops.

## Process

1. **Read Project Guidelines** (if they exist): Use `Glob` and `Read` to inspect `AGENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `STYLEGUIDE.md`, `TESTING.md`, and `SECURITY.md`.
2. **Read the Feature Spec**: Read `specs/changes/<slug>/requirements.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md`.
3. **Validate the Spec**: Call `mcp:verify_complete_spec` for `<slug>` before implementation. Resolve blocking spec issues first.
4. **Inspect Existing Code**: Use `Glob`, `Read`, and `Grep` to understand the files, modules, and patterns referenced by the design.
5. **Select the Next Eligible Task**: Choose the requested task, requested phase, or the next pending task whose dependencies are satisfied.
6. **Execute the Task Loop**: Mark the task in progress, implement it, verify it, then mark it complete.
7. **Repeat**: Continue sequentially when implementing a phase or broader feature scope.

## Per-Phase Todo List

When this skill begins execution, create a todo list derived from the pending tasks in the approved `tasks.md` for the target slug. Each pending task becomes a todo item. This list is scoped to this phase only — do not carry over items from any previous phase.

### Item Derivation

- Read the approved `tasks.md` for the target slug.
- For each task that is `- [ ]` (pending), create a corresponding todo item.
- Skip tasks that are already `- [x]` (completed) or `- [~]` (in progress).

### Progress Rules

- Mark an item `in_progress` when starting that task.
- Mark an item `completed` only after the task has been verified and marked `- [x]` in `tasks.md`.
- Do not mark an item `completed` until verification passes.
- Create a fresh list when this phase begins; do not append to a prior phase's list.

## Source Of Truth

Use these files in this order:

1. `requirements.md` for the intended behavior
2. `design.md` for architectural boundaries and file placement
3. `tasks.md` for execution order and task scope
4. project guideline files for local conventions

If these inputs conflict, stop and resolve the conflict before continuing.

## Task Status Rules

`tasks.md` is the progress ledger and must stay accurate.

Use these checkbox states:

- `- [ ]` pending
- `- [~]` in progress
- `- [x]` completed

### Hard Rule

Update `tasks.md` immediately when a task changes state.

- Mark a task `- [~]` before you begin implementation.
- Mark a task `- [x]` only after implementation and verification succeed.
- Do not batch status updates at the end of a phase or session.

## Execution Loop

For each task:

1. Find the target task in `tasks.md`.
2. Confirm it is pending and all `_Depends:` tasks are complete.
3. Change the task to `- [~]` and save `tasks.md`.
4. Implement only the scoped behavior required by the task.
5. Run the smallest meaningful verification for the change.
6. If verification passes, change the task to `- [x]` and save `tasks.md`.
7. If verification fails, keep the task in progress until the issue is fixed or escalated.

## Task Selection Rules

### Implementing a Specific Task

- Implement only that task unless a required dependency must be finished first.
- Do not opportunistically work ahead on unrelated tasks.

### Implementing a Phase

- Execute pending tasks in that phase in dependency order.
- Complete one task fully before starting the next.

### Implementing a Whole Feature

- Start with the earliest pending task whose dependencies are satisfied.
- Continue phase by phase.

## Implementation Rules

- Follow `design.md` for architecture and file placement.
- Follow `STYLEGUIDE.md` and surrounding code for naming, structure, and patterns.
- Prefer the strongest local convention that is both current and consistent with repository guidance.
- Keep changes minimal and scoped to the active task.
- Do not add features that are not required by the spec.
- Do not refactor unrelated code while implementing the task.
- Respect package and module boundaries.
- Preserve existing error handling expectations unless the task explicitly changes them.

## Test Task Rules

Tasks in the `Acceptance Criteria Testing` phase, or tasks prefixed with `Test:`, should create or update tests rather than production behavior.

### Test Naming

- Remove the `Test:` prefix when writing actual test names.
- Use pure behavior descriptions in test titles.
- Do not include `REQ-*` or `DES-*` IDs in test names.
- Do not include `REQ-*` or `DES-*` IDs in code comments.

Good:

```typescript
it('rejects invalid email addresses', async () => {
  // test body
})
```

Bad:

```typescript
it('Test: rejects invalid email addresses // REQ-2.1', async () => {
  // test body
})
```

### Test Execution

- Follow `TESTING.md` for file placement, tools, and conventions.
- Use the test type specified by the task when present.
- If a test task reveals a defect in existing implementation, fix the implementation before marking the test task complete.

## Verification Rules

Before marking any task `- [x]`, verify all of the following:

- the implementation matches the task description
- the implementation still matches the linked requirements and design intent
- relevant tests pass
- no new failures were introduced in the touched scope
- no new obvious lint or type issues were introduced by the change

Use the smallest meaningful verification first:

- targeted unit or integration tests for local changes
- file- or package-scoped checks when available
- broader validation only when the task impact justifies it

## Documentation Maintenance

Update user-facing documentation when the task changes:

- public behavior
- CLI commands or flags
- configuration or setup steps
- user workflows that the README or docs already describe

Do not update docs for purely internal refactors unless usage actually changes.

## Conflict Policy

Stop and surface the issue if:

- `requirements.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md` disagree materially
- the design does not fit the codebase reality in a safe way
- a task requires a breaking change not described in the spec
- an implementation path would weaken security, privacy, or safety expectations

When a conflict appears:

1. Do not mark the task complete.
2. Summarize the conflict clearly.
3. Propose the smallest reasonable resolution.
4. Ask for clarification only if you cannot safely proceed.

## Recovery Rules

### Spec Validation Failures

If `mcp:verify_complete_spec` reports blocking errors before implementation:

1. Do not start coding yet.
2. Identify whether the issue is in requirements, design, or tasks.
3. Resolve the spec issue first or ask for guidance if the issue is ambiguous.

### Test Failures During Implementation

If verification fails:

1. Keep the current task at `- [~]`.
2. Fix the implementation or test as appropriate.
3. Re-run the relevant verification.
4. Escalate only if the failure indicates a real spec or design problem.

### Interrupted Sessions

If work resumes after interruption:

1. Read `tasks.md` first.
2. Locate any `- [~]` task.
3. Verify the code and file state for that task.
4. Resume that task before starting new work.

## Things To Avoid

- adding HTML comments such as `<!-- TBD -->`, `<!-- KNOWN ISSUE -->`, or `<!-- FAILED -->`
- adding scope that is not requested
- silently diverging from the design
- marking tasks complete without verification
- batching multiple task status updates after the fact
- introducing secrets or sensitive data into the repository

## Quality Bar (Self-Check)

Before marking a task complete or reporting progress, verify:

- [ ] active task status in `tasks.md` is accurate
- [ ] task dependencies were satisfied before starting
- [ ] changes are scoped to the active task
- [ ] implementation matches requirements and design intent
- [ ] relevant verification was run and passed
- [ ] no task-state updates were skipped
- [ ] no HTML comments or drafting markers were introduced

## Output Requirements

When reporting implementation progress or completion:

- summarize the work in ordinary prose
- list the key files changed
- identify the next eligible task or state that the phase is complete

## Response Behavior

If the requested task or phase is implementable, execute it directly.

If material ambiguity or a blocking spec conflict prevents safe implementation, ask a short clarification instead of making a low-confidence change.

## Quality Grading Integration

After completing implementation phases, invoke the `quality-grading` skill to assess and improve code quality:

```
Invoke: quality-grading skill
Artifact: <implementation-directory-or-files>
Mode: grade-and-fix
```

Quality-grading evaluates implementation across:
- **Design Quality**: Architecture clarity, module structure, separation of concerns
- **Originality**: Problem-specific solutions vs generic boilerplate
- **Craft**: Code cleanliness, error handling, documentation, naming consistency
- **Functionality**: Feature completeness, edge case handling, requirements coverage

For ongoing quality during implementation:
- After completing core implementation tasks: grade the implementation directory
- After completing final checkpoint: run final quality assessment

The quality-grading skill will auto-fix issues scoring below 4 and provide actionable suggestions for remaining gaps.
