# Pi-SmartRead agent instructions

## Scope

These instructions apply to the repository root. Keep agent-specific operational rules here; put user-facing behavior and setup in `README.md`.

Pi-SmartRead is a TypeScript/ESM Pi extension plus standalone MCP server. It owns code retrieval, structural analysis, repository intelligence, read-only language-server access, workspace evidence production, and the SmartRead side of the SmartEdit evidence/LSP proposal contract.

## Canonical commands

Use **npm**. `package-lock.json` is the canonical lockfile and CI runs Node 20.

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Install | `npm ci` |
| Typecheck | `npm run typecheck` |
| Lint | `npm run lint` |
| Full tests | `npm test` |
| Focused test | `npx vitest run path/to/test.ts` |
| LSP unit suite | `npx vitest run test/unit/lsp` |
| Validate skills | `node scripts/validate-skills.mjs` |
| Run MCP server | `npm run mcp-server` |
| Load extension locally | `pi -e ./src/index.ts` |
| Opt-in real LSP suite | `PI_SMARTREAD_LSP_CONFORMANCE=1 npx vitest run test/integration/lsp` |

Before finishing source changes, run the narrowest relevant tests plus `npm run typecheck`. For broad/runtime changes, run `npm test`. CI runs typecheck + full tests on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Current model-facing surfaces

### Pi extension

- `read`: exactly one selector per call: `path`, `paths`, `query`, or `symbol`.
- `inspect`: explicit `mode: "file" | "directory" | "navigate" | "script"`; mode is never inferred.
- `grep`: text/symbol/concept search, batch queries, structural options, graph filters.
- `LSP`: strict read-only LSP contract. Tool name is uppercase `LSP`.
- `skill`: discovers project/package/global skills.
- Experimental: `graph_mutate`, `git_notes_read`, `git_notes_write` only when enabled.

### Standalone MCP

The MCP registry exposes `inspect`, `grep`, `skill`, plus enabled experimental registry tools. It does **not** expose the Pi-only wrapped `read` tool or the Pi-registered strict `LSP` tool.

MCP also exposes prompts from `src/mcp/mcp-prompts.ts` and `smartread://` resources from `src/mcp/mcp-resources.ts`.

## Coordinate conventions: do not mix them

There are two LSP-facing contracts:

- Strict `LSP` tool: `position: { line, character }` is **0-based** in `server.positionEncoding`. Operations use names such as `goToDefinition`, `findReferences`, `codeActions`.
- `inspect { mode: "navigate" }` and script-mode `lsp.*` helpers: navigation `line` / `character` are **1-based** and use the inspect navigation operation names such as `definition`, `references`, `implementation`.

Do not port examples between these surfaces without converting both operation names and coordinates.

## Evidence contract and SmartEdit boundary

`@rhinos0608/pi-workspace-protocol` is pinned in `package.json`. Import `PROTOCOL_SCHEMA_VERSION`; do not hardcode a schema number in new code.

- `read` produces strong evidence only for content actually rendered. Complete file blocks can authorize patching; omitted/partial packed blocks cannot.
- Large-file AST outlines produce line-range evidence, not full-file authority.
- `inspect` and `grep` produce discovery/search-match evidence. Read the relevant file/range before mutation.
- `details.workspaceEvidence` on tool results is the durable source of truth. The in-memory resolver cache is derived from tool-result events.
- Evidence-producing canonical paths must use real paths with symlinks resolved. Follow the existing `tryCanonical`/realpath pattern; do not replace it with bare `path.resolve`.
- SmartRead publishes evidence and semantic proposals. **SmartEdit owns file mutation.** SmartRead must never apply LSP WorkspaceEdits.

See `docs/lsp-smartedit-contract.md` before changing language-intelligence RPC proposal behavior.

## LSP invariants

- `LSP` is strict and fail-closed: unknown operations/foreign fields are caller errors.
- Exact `server` routing means exact descriptor id. No fuzzy server selection.
- Unroutable requests return an `unavailable` envelope; do not invent a fallback server.
- Raw `request` is observational allowlist only. `workspace/executeCommand`, `workspace/applyEdit`, and unknown methods are rejected.
- Rename/code-action/format results are proposals only; no disk writes.
- Respect negotiated position encoding on the direct strict surface. The SmartEdit-facing RPC proposal path is intentionally UTF-16-only/fail-closed today.
- Project-local language-server binaries execute only for trusted roots. Managed installs are exact-version npm installs under `~/.pi/agent/language-intelligence/`.

Conformance details and test evidence live in `docs/lsp-conformance.md`.

## Read/search/inspect invariants

- Direct file reads are intentionally **not** gated by `PI_SMARTREAD_ALLOWED_ROOT`. That env var scopes automatic semantic indexing/retrieval only. Do not wire workspace-boundary helpers into direct read/inspect paths without an explicit contract change.
- `src/scoring.ts` owns the canonical `cosineSimilarity`. Do not add local copies.
- Dead-code analysis compares against relative paths because call-graph file identifiers are relative.
- `inspect { mode: "script" }` runs bounded read-only QuickJS. Keep host APIs explicit; no edit/write/patch/eval escape hatch.
- Script-mode defaults are 50 host calls, 10 LSP calls, 5 concurrent operations, 5s wall time, and bounded result bytes. Preserve quota admission before awaiting host work.

## Configuration and security

Repository config is `pi-smartread.config.json`, discovered upward from cwd.

Network destinations and credentials are user-environment trust decisions:

- Embeddings endpoint: `PI_SMARTREAD_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL`; key: `PI_SMARTREAD_EMBEDDING_API_KEY`.
- External reranker endpoint: `PI_SMARTREAD_RERANKER_BASE_URL`; key: `PI_SMARTREAD_RERANKER_API_KEY`.
- Repo-level `baseUrl` / API-key fields must not become trusted network configuration.

Non-network knobs such as model names, chunk sizes, HyDE/rerank flags, reranker model/timeouts, git context, search enrichment, and experimental flags may come from the config file.

## Generated/runtime state

Do not hand-edit or commit runtime caches/output:

`.pi/`, `.pi-smartread/`, `.pi-smartread.tags.cache/`, `.pi-smartread.embeddings.cache/`, `.pi-subagents/`, `graphify-out/`, `.smart-edit-undo/`, `.subagent-work/`.

If a test needs these formats, build fixtures in temp directories instead of reusing a developer's live cache.

## Cross-repo coordination

- **Pi-Workspace-Protocol** defines shared evidence/RPC types and helpers. A shared-contract change requires a compatible protocol tag/version update and coordinated SmartRead + SmartEdit consumption.
- **Pi-SmartEdit** consumes SmartRead evidence and language-intelligence proposals. Do not modify the sister repository unless the task explicitly includes it.
- Keep unresolved SmartEdit-owned transaction/atomicity/encoding/cancellation decisions documented in `docs/lsp-smartedit-contract.md`; do not silently turn them into SmartRead policy.

## Documentation rules

- `README.md` is the public onboarding and capability map.
- `AGENTS.md` is for operational constraints, commands, ownership boundaries, and easy-to-miss traps.
- `docs/plans/` records active design plans; `docs/archive/` is historical and may describe removed tools.
- When a tool schema changes, update its source description, relevant skills, README examples, and tests in the same change.
