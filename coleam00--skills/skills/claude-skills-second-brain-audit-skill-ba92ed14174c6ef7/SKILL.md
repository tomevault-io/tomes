description: Audit any second brain, notes folder, or agent memory for facts that have quietly stopped being true, then fix the worst one so it stops recurring. Works on a wiki, a single notes file, daily notes, or a non-markdown tool, and adapts the fix to whichever it finds. Checks every current-sounding claim in whatever the agent loads each session against the freshest evidence, and separates contradicted claims from unsupported ones. Use when an assistant gives an outdated answer, when notes or memory files may be stale, when a vault needs checking for contradictions, or when someone asks how to stop a second brain from rotting, mentions memory rot, or asks about state versus event. Use when this capability is needed.

# Second Brain Audit

Notes rot in a specific way. Nothing is corrupted and nothing goes missing: a fact
simply stops being true, the note keeps saying it, and nothing raises a hand.

The cause is almost always the same. **The write path can only append.** New
information arrives and becomes a new line under the old line, which is correct for
some facts and ruinous for others.

## The one idea

Every stored fact is one of two kinds.

| | Meaning | Correct update |
|---|---|---|
| **State** | one current value, and it **changes** | **replace** it |
| **Event** | a timestamped thing that **happened** | **append** it |

A price, a status, an owner, a deadline: state. A payment, a signature, a decision,
a lesson learned: event.

The update rules are **opposites**. Replacing an event destroys history. Appending a
state creates two answers to one question with nothing marking which is current, and
the stale copy usually sits higher in the file, so it gets read first.

**Structure carries this rule, not an instruction.** Asking a model, or a person, to
remember to update the old entry fails quietly and constantly. Give the page two
sections and the rule follows from where a fact lands.

## Phase 1: establish the shape

**Do not assume a wiki, a vault, or pages.** Most people have none of those. Look at
what actually exists before anything else, because it changes both what the audit can
see and what the fix should be.

| Shape | Looks like | Where state should live |
|---|---|---|
| **Page per subject** | `clients/acme.md`, `projects/x.md` | two sections on each page |
| **One big file** | a single `notes.md` or `CLAUDE.md` | a `## Current State` block at the top |
| **Daily notes only** | `2026-06-01.md`, and nothing else | **nothing to convert.** A state layer is missing entirely |
| **Not markdown** | Notion, Apple Notes, a chat assistant's memory | the idea still applies; the tooling does not |

The notes folder this run was invoked with is `$notes`, and it is optional
(`/second-brain-audit ~/notes`). Use it when it is a real path. When nothing was passed, so the
line above still reads `\$notes`, use the working directory and confirm it with the user. When it
is a path that does not exist, say so and stop rather than auditing the wrong folder.

Then establish two things:

1. **Where the notes live.** A folder of markdown, for the scan.
2. **What the agent reads on every session.** `CLAUDE.md`, a `MEMORY.md`, a system
   prompt file, whatever loads automatically. This matters more than anything else:
   a stale fact in an archive is harmless, the same fact in the always-loaded file is
   the bug. If the user does not know, say so and run without it.

Daily-notes-only is the case most worth naming out loud. Dated notes are an **event
log**, and events are supposed to accumulate; nothing about them is broken. What is
missing is any place that says what is true *now*. Telling someone to restructure
their journal would be actively wrong.

## Phase 2: audit the always-loaded surface

**This is the part that works on every second brain**, in any tool, in any domain,
with or without the script. Run it always, even when the scan found plenty.

Whatever the agent reads on every session is small: that is what makes it always
loadable. So it can be read in full and checked claim by claim.

1. **Read that surface completely.** The always-loaded file, or the top of the one
   big file, or the pinned page. All of it. Then check it actually arrives in full:
   hooks and context budgets truncate, usually from the bottom, and a file that is
   "always loaded" on disk can reach the agent as its oldest third. Audit what
   arrives, and treat the cut itself as a finding.
2. **Extract every state-shaped claim.** Anything phrased as a current fact: a
   status, an owner, a rate, a version, a deadline, a "currently", a "we use", a
   "lives at". Ignore anything phrased as an event, since events stay true.
3. **For each claim, go and find the freshest evidence anywhere in the notes.**
   Grep the subject. Read the newest file that mentions it.
4. **Sort each claim into three piles:**
   - **Confirmed.** The detail agrees.
   - **Contradicted.** Something newer disagrees. This is rot, and it is the
     headline.
   - **Unsupported.** Nothing anywhere backs it up. Often the claim was true once
     and the evidence was never written, which is worth saying out loud.

Ten to thirty claims is normal, and it is a few minutes of reading. A research vault
with no money in it, a personal wiki, a Notion workspace: all auditable this way, and
none of them by the script.

Report the contradicted pile first, then the unsupported pile. Both are findings.

## Phase 3: run the scan, if the notes suit it

An accelerator, not the audit. It applies to markdown folders where facts carry
monetary values, and it finds cross-file disagreements far faster than reading can.
Skip it otherwise; phase 2 already did the work.

```bash
python <skill>/scripts/audit.py <notes-dir> \
    --always-loaded MEMORY.md --always-loaded CLAUDE.md \
    --subject rate --subject <one word per subject that matters>
```

Pass `--subject` for every subject you care about, one word each (`rate`, not
`"Hourly rate"`), and `--json` for structured output. On a small folder the script
attributes values by page name and bold key only, so without `--subject` a real
cross-file contradiction can come back as a clean zero with no warning. The script
counts; phase 2 is the audit. It only reads; it never writes.

**A zero is not a clean bill of health.** Values are the only thing it can compare
without guessing, so notes with no money in them are largely invisible to it, and so
is a status that changed while the amount did not ("$32,300 due" versus "$32,300 on
hold" is the same number). Its "0 touch a file your agent loads" line counts money
only; the always-loaded file is audited in phase 2, never by this count. It
prints a COVERAGE WARNING when it knows it was blind. Read that warning out rather
than reporting "no problems found".

**Why a script at all:** the count has to be the same twice. A model asked to tally
600 bullets returns a confident number and a different one tomorrow, which is the
class of failure this skill exists to fix. The script counts. The agent judges.

## Phase 4: read what neither can see

Open a few flagged pages and look for what no regex will catch:

- **Lifecycle conflicts.** A page saying "launching next week" while a log entry from
  three months ago records the project being cancelled. No number disagrees, so
  nothing is flagged, and it is completely wrong.
- **Facts never written down at all.** The most common cause of a wrong answer is not
  bad organization; it is that the true value only ever existed in a conversation or
  a daily note. Reorganizing cannot reach it. Say so plainly rather than implying the
  restructure will help.
- **Pages that must not be touched.** Checklists, reference lists, packing lists.
  They are lists on purpose. Converting one destroys what makes it useful, and every
  structural check still passes.
- **Two true lines, one impossible schedule.** Each Current State line is checked
  against its own subject; nothing checks two lines against each other. Two
  deliverables "live 9/23" on two keys is either a real conflict or a shared host
  video, and the lines should say which. Grep the block for repeated dates.
- **A fresh date on a value nobody checked.** A rewrite that re-dates lines it merely
  moved, or a "rows verified today" note over a table seeded months ago, gives stale
  values the one thing that would have exposed them. Check what `git blame` says
  about a freshly dated line before trusting the date; a date is a claim that the
  value was verified, not a stamp that the line was touched.
- **Key sprawl.** One subject spread across many Current State keys ("Brief 10050
  draft", "Brief 10050 review pass", "Brief 10050 record day"). Every key is unique,
  so the duplicate check passes, and the freshest of them can still be stale. The
  reverse of the duplicate-key bug, and the same fix: one key per thing that has
  one status. Report it; collapsing is the owner's call.

## Phase 5: report

Lead with the single most damaging finding, not a summary of the tool's output:

> Three different answers for what Acme pays, and the oldest one is in the file the
> agent reads every session.

Where an agent already runs over these notes, **demonstrate it**. Ask the question the
notes should answer and read the reply out. Watching an assistant confidently return
a number that stopped being true in March lands harder than any report. Point out the
common case where it is *diligent and still wrong*: it checks a page, warns that
another file looks stale, and still misses the true value because that value was
never promoted anywhere durable.

On a small folder a capable agent will read everything and find the truth. Confine
the demonstration to what the agent is actually handed every session (paste the
always-loaded file alone, or run with read tools off) and ask again. The gap between
the two answers is the finding.

## Phase 6: fix one place

Never bulk-convert, and never convert a page the user did not agree to. Fix the
single worst *location*, which depends on the shape found in phase 1:

- **Page per subject** → give that one page the two sections below.
- **An index the agent loads every session** (a `MEMORY.md`, a pinned summary) → it
  is state, whatever it calls itself. Put a dated `## Current State` block at the
  TOP so it survives any truncation, key each line on the deal, and move superseded
  lines verbatim to a `## Log` at the bottom. Leave the to-do list in between.
- **One big file** → add a `## Current State` block at the top and leave everything
  else beneath it. No new files, no folder structure. If the file already has a block
  that claims to be current ("Current status", "Now", "Active"), its lines move into
  the new block or into the Log by rule 2. Two sections claiming now is the bug you
  are removing, so never leave the old block in place.
- **Daily notes only** → create **one** file holding current values, and leave every
  journal entry untouched. The journal was already correct.
- **Not markdown** → do not restructure anything. Explain where the current value
  should live in the tool they already use, and stop there.

The shape below is the page-per-subject version; adapt the same two ideas to the
others. What has to be true in every case is only this: **one place says what is true
now, and it gets replaced rather than added to.**

```markdown
## Current State
<!-- One entry per subject. Dated. REPLACED on update, never appended to. -->

- **Retainer** (2026-08-01): $3,200/mo, renewed through February 2027
- **Main contact** (2026-05-02): Curtis Ilo

## Log
<!-- Append-only. Never edit or delete an entry. -->

- (2026-04-30) Delivered and paid, $21,000
- (2026-05-02) Retainer started at $2,800/mo
- (2026-06-15) Added reply drafting, retainer to $3,200/mo
```

Conversion rules, in order of importance:

1. **Lose nothing.** Every existing line lands in one of the two sections, verbatim.
   This is sorting, not rewriting. Improving the prose is how information disappears
   without anyone noticing.
2. **One entry per subject in Current State.** Where two lines describe the same
   current value, the newer wins and the older moves to the Log. Where the order is
   unclear, ask. Never guess.
3. **Date every Current State entry.** Ask for a missing date or take it from file
   history. An undated current value is barely better than a stale one. The date on a
   line you moved is the line's own date, never today's: dating is a claim that the
   value was checked, and a move checks nothing.
4. **Never merge two subjects that merely look similar.** "Acme (May)" and "Acme Corp
   renewal" may be genuinely different things. A duplicate entry is a cheap mistake;
   a wrong merge destroys information. Report near-misses and let the user decide.
5. **Show a diff and get approval** before writing.

Re-ask the earlier question afterwards so the correct answer is visible. Same notes,
same agent, one page restructured. Then record what is still outstanding, which is
phase 8, or the next run starts from nothing.

## Phase 7: change the write path

This phase decides whether the audit was worth anything. Converting pages fixes
today; changing how facts get written is what stops the recurrence.

Add to whatever file instructs the agent (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, a system prompt):

```markdown
## Writing to these notes

Every fact is state or event.

- **State** (one current value that changes: price, status, owner, date):
  find the matching line in `## Current State` and REPLACE it. Always date it.
  Never add a second line for the same subject.
- **Event** (a thing that happened): append to `## Log`. Never edit or delete
  an existing Log entry.

If unsure, append to the Log and say so. A missing state update is recoverable;
a rewritten history is not.
```

Then state the honest part: this instruction gets followed most of the time, not all
of the time. Anything that must happen every time needs a mechanism. Two cheap ones
worth more than the instruction:

- Re-run this audit on a schedule and watch whether the count climbs. Phase 8 is what
  makes that comparison possible. The count to watch is the contradicted pile from phase 2. The script's totals can rise after a
  correct fix, because Current State lines that say "paid" or "complete" match its
  open-list regex.
- Stamp dates with a script after the fact instead of asking for them.
- Regenerate any column that can be regenerated (a repo's visibility from the forge,
  a version from the package file) instead of typing it. A value nobody checks is
  wrong within a quarter, and a check is cheaper than the audit that finds it.

## Phase 8: leave the findings somewhere durable

Everything above this point exists only in a conversation. Close the window and the
audit is gone: the piles, the claims, the locations you did not reach. That is the
same failure this whole skill is about, committed by the skill itself.

So write it down, in the shape being taught. **One file** in the notes folder, called
`second-brain-audit.md`:

```markdown
# Second brain audit

## Current State
<!-- One entry per location. REPLACED when that location changes. -->

- **MEMORY.md** (2026-09-18): the always-loaded file. 6 contradicted, 3 unsupported.
  FIXED this run, `## Current State` block added at the top, 9 superseded lines to `## Log`.
- **clients/acme.md** (2026-09-18): 4 contradicted, all about the retainer. NEXT.
- **notes/tools.md** (2026-09-18): 2 unsupported, no trail, low value. Leave it.
- **write path** (2026-09-18): rule added to `CLAUDE.md`.

## Log
<!-- Append-only. One entry per audit run. -->

- (2026-09-18) First run. 24 claims in the always-loaded file: 13 confirmed,
  6 contradicted, 5 unsupported. Fixed MEMORY.md. Asked "what do we charge Acme?"
  before and after, and got $4,000 then $9,500.
```

Four rules for that file:

1. **Each location is a key.** Fixing it REPLACES its line. Never a second line for
   one location.
2. **Each run is one Log entry**, carrying the contradicted count. That count is the
   number to watch over time. If it climbs, the write path is not holding.
3. **Keep it out of what loads every session.** It is a work queue, not a fact about
   the business, and it quotes stale claims verbatim.
4. **Something else reads it next.** `/second-brain-fix` works the queue in batches, and a
   later audit reads the Log to see whether the count moved. Whatever is marked NEXT is
   where the fixing starts, unless a later run turns up something worse.

`audit.py` skips any file whose name starts with `second-brain-audit`, so the report
never comes back as evidence in a later scan.

### Then hand it to the fixer

Say this out loud at the end, because it is the question every user has and the answer is
not "run this again":

> The audit fixed one location so you could see the shape. To work through the rest, run
> `/second-brain-fix`, or `/second-brain-fix <path to this file>` from anywhere else. It reads
> this same file, batches the findings, and updates the ledger as it goes.

Fixing one location at a time is correct for this skill and useless as a plan. Nobody runs a
seven-phase audit forty times. The batch job is a separate skill because it has a different
contract: this one never bulk-converts and gates every write behind a diff, that one writes
many files at once and requires a branch or a copy before it starts.

### Stop when the surface is clean

There is no version of this where every page gets converted, and chasing that is how
people quit in week two. The finish line is narrow: **nothing contradicted in what the
agent loads every session.** An archive full of old pages is not rot, it is history.
Convert a deeper page only when it has a trail (several entries about one subject over
time) or when it keeps producing wrong answers.

## Set expectations honestly

Restructuring alone often moves the number less than people expect. When it does not
move, the reason is usually that the correct fact was never captured, and no amount
of reorganizing reaches a fact nobody wrote down. Say that when it applies. The
audit's real value is identifying *which* of the two problems is in play.

## Resources

- `scripts/audit.py`: run it for the deterministic scan; `--help` lists all flags,
  `--json` returns structured findings. Never read it into context; only its output.
