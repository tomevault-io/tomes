# Anti-Slop Design Skill ("Taste Layer")

Build UIs that look like a senior designer made them, not a language model. This skill enforces category-aware design thinking, concrete palettes, and a pre-delivery quality gate.

## When to Use

- Building any UI: landing page, dashboard, app screen, marketing site
- User asks to "design", "build a page", "create a component", or "make it look good"
- User asks to "create a design system" or "set up design tokens"
- Reviewing or improving existing UI code

**For full pages or multi-section layouts**, also read `reference.md` in this skill directory. It contains section anatomy patterns, extended slop catalog, microcopy examples, stack-specific notes, common mistakes per category, CSS token starters, and a mobile-first checklist. Skip it for single-component work.

---

## Step 0: Read Design Context

Before designing anything, inspect the project:

1. Check the package manifest for styling approach (Tailwind, CSS Modules, styled-components, vanilla CSS).
2. Check for existing design tokens: `tailwind.config.*`, `theme.ts`, CSS variable files, `globals.css`.
3. Check for existing font imports (Google Fonts `@import`, `next/font`, `@font-face`).
4. Check for an existing icon library (lucide-react, heroicons, phosphor, etc.).
5. If a design system already exists, respect it. Extend, do not replace.

Skip this step only for standalone demos or canvases with no project context.

---

## Step 1: Design Thinking

Before writing any UI code, commit to a direction. Never skip this.

1. **Pick the register.** Every surface is **brand** (marketing, landing, campaign, portfolio -- design IS the product) or **product** (app UI, dashboard, admin, tool -- design SERVES the task). Brand surfaces earn drama; product surfaces earn clarity, restraint, and density control. Two common slop sources: brand drama applied to product UI, and timid product defaults applied to brand pages.
2. **Identify the category.** Match the project to a row in the Category Design Guide below.
3. **Pick the tone.** Use the category's recommended tone or choose a bold alternative -- never "modern and clean" (that is generic). Tone vocabulary to draw from: brutally minimal, maximalist, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, industrial/utilitarian.
4. **Choose the theme from a scene, not a category.** Dark vs. light is never a default. Write one sentence of physical scene -- who uses this, where, under what ambient light, in what mood -- and let it force the answer. "SRE glancing at incident severity at 2am in a dim room" forces dark; "the category is observability" forces nothing.
5. **Pick a color strategy** (see Color Strategy below) before picking any hex values.
6. **State the memorable thing.** What is the ONE element someone will remember? Commit to it.
7. **Vary across generations.** If your last output was dark editorial, the next must differ -- unless the user explicitly requests consistency.

**Intentionality over intensity.** Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work; the only failure is timid genericness. Match implementation complexity to the vision: maximalist directions need elaborate code and orchestrated effects; minimal directions need precision in spacing, type, and subtle detail. Restraint executed well is a strong direction, not a missing one.

---

## Color Strategy (commit before picking hexes)

Four steps on a commitment axis -- choose one deliberately per surface:

| Strategy | What it means | Use for |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| **Restrained** | Tinted neutrals + one accent on ≤10% of the surface | Product UI default, dense dashboards, minimalist brand |
| **Committed** | One saturated color carries 30–60% of the surface | Identity-driven brand pages, bold landing heroes |
| **Full palette** | 3–4 named color roles, each used deliberately | Campaigns, editorial layouts, data visualization |
| **Drenched** | The surface IS the color | Brand heroes, campaign moments, posters |

The accent-counting rule in the Slop Second Pass applies to **Restrained** only -- Committed, Full palette, and Drenched exceed it on purpose. Do not collapse every design to Restrained by reflex, and do not "decorate" a Restrained product surface into Committed by accident.

Mechanics: prefer OKLCH when the stack allows. Tint every neutral toward the brand hue (chroma 0.005–0.01 is enough -- never pure gray). Reduce chroma as lightness approaches 0 or 100; high chroma at the extremes looks garish.

---

## Banned Patterns ("AI Slop")

These are the statistical median of AI training data. Never generate them:

- Three-column card grids with centered icons and centered text
- Indigo/purple gradients on buttons or text (unless explicitly requested)
- Thick gray borders and over-boxed layouts
- Emoji as UI icons
- Inter, Roboto, Arial, system-ui, Space Grotesk as default fonts
- Empty hero sections with no imagery or decorative elements
- Generic "Lorem ipsum" placeholder text
- Colored-circle-initial avatars
- 5-star yellow rating widgets
- Cookie-cutter components with no context-specific character
- Side-stripe accent borders (`border-left: 4px solid` on cards, callouts, alerts) -- use full borders, background tints, or a leading icon instead
- Gradient text (`background-clip: text` over a gradient) -- emphasize with weight, size, or a solid color
- The hero-metric template (big number + small label + gradient accent) as the only dashboard idea
- Nested cards (a card inside a card) -- flatten, or separate with background shifts
- Modal as the first thought -- exhaust inline editing and progressive disclosure before reaching for a dialog

### Secondary slop signals (also avoid)

These patterns are nearly as common as the list above; treat them as soft bans unless the user explicitly wants them.

- **Glass stacks**: multiple nested `backdrop-blur` panels filling the page — reads as template UI; use glass for one focal layer only.
- **Blob clusters**: three overlapping blurred circles (purple/pink/cyan) behind every hero — substitute category-specific texture, photography, or one intentional mesh.
- **Fake social proof**: "Trusted by" with placeholder logos, repeated generic company names, or SVG boxes labeled "Logo".
- **Abstract 3D illustration overload**: same glossy shapes on every SaaS landing — prefer product screenshots, UI chrome, or category-appropriate photography.
- **Identical section rhythm**: every block is `py-24` + headline + subtitle + grid — vary vertical rhythm, full-bleed breaks, or editorial pulls.
- **Motion soup**: everything fades in on scroll with the same delay — stagger meaningfully or reserve motion for one hero moment.
- **Generic microcopy**: "Welcome!", "No data available", "Something went wrong" with no next step — write voice-specific, actionable copy (see reference.md).

---

## Multimodal Design Parity (M3)

When the user provides a design mock, screenshot, or reference image, treat the image as the contract for the build. On M3 the runtime can read the image directly; do not paraphrase from a guessed description.

- `Read` the image file in the current session and reference the exact path in your closeout.
- Cite the **region** you are matching (hero block, top-right nav, footer) when reviewing deviations — generic "looks right" is not a citation.
- After the build, re-read the resulting state (post-change screenshot/frame) and compare against the reference; state "visually matched" only when you actually opened both.
- If the reference is a low-fidelity wireframe, design for the wireframe's intent, not its pixel values; if the reference is a high-fidelity mock, match the values.
- For multi-image sets (desktop, tablet, mobile mockups), re-read each before claiming a responsive match.

## Stack And Kit Integration

When the project already uses **shadcn/ui**, **Radix**, **MUI**, or similar:

1. **Do not replace** the component library for marketing polish — map the Category Design Guide to **semantic tokens** (`--primary`, `--background`, `--muted`, radius) so primitives stay accessible.
2. Override at **theme / CSS variable** layer first; only fork components when layout truly demands it.
3. For Tailwind v4, prefer `@theme` or token files that align with existing `globals.css` — avoid parallel conflicting palettes.

---

## Copy, Empty, And Error States

- Headlines and CTAs should sound like **this product**, not any SaaS: ban "Empower your workflow", "Unlock potential", "Streamline operations" unless ironic.
- **Empty states**: explain what will appear, one primary action, optional illustration that matches category — not a gray box and "Nothing here".
- **Errors**: what failed, what the user can do, support or retry — not only red text "Error".
- **Loading**: prefer skeleton shapes that match final layout; avoid infinite shimmer on unrelated blocks.

---

## Category Design Guide

Match the project to a category. Use the palette, fonts, and patterns as your starting point -- then push further.

**Category-reflex check.** These tables are a floor, not a ceiling. If someone could guess your palette from the category name alone (healthcare → teal on white, fintech → navy + gold, gaming → neon on black), you have reproduced the training-data median -- the polished version of slop. Run the scene sentence, the tone choice, and any brand inputs against the table until the domain no longer fully predicts the design.

## The Taste Layer Principles

These apply universally across all categories.

### Typography
- Distinctive font pairings mandatory -- use the category guide as starting point.
- Hierarchy through weight and color, not just size. De-emphasize secondary text with tinted muted colors, not smaller-and-black.
- Keep ≥1.25 ratio between adjacent scale steps -- flat scales read as no hierarchy at all.
- Tighten letter-spacing as display size grows (`-0.01em` to `-0.04em` above ~32px); never negative-track body text.
- Cap body measure at 65–75ch regardless of category.
- Left-align body text. Center-align only for short hero headlines.

### Color
- Cohesive palette via CSS variables. One dominant + one sharp accent beats an evenly-distributed rainbow.
- Tinted grays (slate, zinc, stone) that complement the primary. Never pure neutral gray.
- Dark mode: rich deep colors (`#0A0A0B`, `#0f172a`), not `#000`. Light mode: warm/cool off-whites, not `#FFF`.

### Spacing and Layout
- Start with too much whitespace, then tighten. Strict 4px-based spacing scale.
- Vary spacing for rhythm -- identical padding on every section is monotony, not consistency.
- Integrated over boxed: elements breathe on the canvas, not everything in cards. Cards are the lazy default -- use them only when grouping is truly the right affordance, and never nest them.
- Spatial composition is a tool: asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, and one deliberate grid-breaking element beat a perfectly safe stack of centered blocks (brand surfaces especially).
- All sections share the same `max-width` and horizontal padding -- edges align hero to footer.
- Hero: `height: 100svh` with symmetric vertical padding for true optical centering.

### Motion
- Orchestrated page entrance with staggered `animation-delay` reveals.
- `IntersectionObserver` for scroll-triggered fade-up/slide-in below the fold.
- Animate only `transform` and `opacity` -- never layout properties (`width`, `height`, `top`, `margin`).
- Ease out with exponential curves (ease-out-quart/quint/expo). No bounce or elastic in product UI; reserve spring physics for deliberately playful brand moments.
- Hover states that surprise: scale, color shift, shadow, underline. Not just opacity.
- Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### Backgrounds and Atmosphere
- Match to category: gradient meshes for luxury, noise/grain for tactile premium, dot-grids for technical, organic shapes for wellness.
- Glassmorphism only when it serves the design, not as a default.

### Borders and Depth
- Separate with whitespace or subtle background shifts. Use `ring-1 ring-black/5` for subtle edges.
- Shadows only for true elevation (dropdowns, floating nav). No decorative drop shadows.

### Icons
- Real SVG only: Lucide, Heroicons, Phosphor, Hugeicons. Never emoji.
- Style matches tone: stroke for minimal, filled for bold, duotone for marketing.
- Sizes: 16-20px inline, 24px nav, 32-48px feature callouts.

### Imagery
- Hero sections never visually empty: real photography (Unsplash, Pexels), product screenshots, or decorative SVG.
- Real headshots for testimonials, not colored-circle initials.
- When photography unavailable: animated SVG shapes, gradient blobs, or geometric patterns.

## Design System Generation

When asked to create a design system or set up tokens, output this structure:

### Master Tokens

```
Category: [matched from Category Design Guide]
Tone: [one sentence]

Palette (CSS variables):
  --color-primary:    [hex]
  --color-secondary:  [hex]
  --color-accent:     [hex]
  --color-surface:    [hex]
  --color-surface-alt:[hex]
  --color-text:       [hex]
  --color-text-muted: [hex]
  --color-success:    [hex]
  --color-warning:    [hex]
  --color-error:      [hex]

Typography:
  --font-display: '[Display Font]', [fallback]
  --font-body:    '[Body Font]', [fallback]
  --font-mono:    '[Mono Font]', monospace  (if needed)

  Scale: 12 / 14 / 16 / 18 / 20 / 24 / 30 / 36 / 48 / 60 / 72

Spacing (4px base):
  4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 24 / 32 / 40 / 48 / 64 / 80 / 96

Border radius:
  --radius-sm: 4px
  --radius-md: 8px
  --radius-lg: 16px
  --radius-full: 9999px

Shadows:
  --shadow-sm:  0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)
  --shadow-md:  0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
  --shadow-lg:  0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)
```

### Page Overrides (Optional)

When a specific page deviates from the master (e.g., a marketing landing page within a SaaS dashboard), document the override:

```
Page: [name]
Overrides:
  --color-surface: [different hex]
  Tone shift: [e.g., "more playful than the dashboard default"]
  Additional font: [if needed]
```

---

## Domain-Specific Patterns

| Domain | Key rules |
|--------|-----------|
| **Landing pages** | Hero with 100svh centering, consistent max-width across sections, real imagery or decorative SVG fills, single primary CTA per section |
| **Dashboards** | Dense but hierarchical, semantic status colors, real chart libraries (Recharts, Chart.js with fixed-height containers), data tables with proper alignment |
| **Forms** | Accessible labels on every input, clear error states with color + icon + text, logical tab order, generous touch targets (44px min) |
| **Marketing sites** | Story-driven scroll, social proof near CTAs, distinctive hero that is not a three-column card grid, real testimonial photos |
| **Mobile / responsive** | 44px minimum touch targets, fluid typography (`clamp()`), thumb-zone navigation, no horizontal scroll, test at 375px and 768px |

---

## Workflow

```
1. READ    -> Inspect project: styling approach, existing tokens, fonts, icons
2. MATCH   -> Register (brand vs product) + category from the Category Design Guide
3. COMMIT  -> Scene sentence (theme) + color strategy + tone + memorable element
4. BUILD   -> Apply category palette, fonts, and patterns + Taste Layer principles
5. CHECK   -> Run Pre-Delivery Checklist + Slop second pass before presenting
```

---

## Slop Second Pass (before ship)

After the main checklist, scan once for:

1. **Sameness**: If two sections could swap places with no loss of meaning, differentiate structure or merge them.
2. **Proof**: At least one place shows **real product, real data shape, or real imagery** — not only abstract shapes and lorem.
3. **One accent rule** (Restrained strategy only): Count accent-color uses; if more than three competing "look at me" elements per viewport, demote some to neutral. For Committed/Full/Drenched strategies, check instead that the color commitment is consistent, not accidental.
4. **Category reflex**: Could someone guess the palette from the category name alone? If yes, push at least one axis (theme, accent, type) off the median.
5. **Touch**: Every primary action on mobile is reachable and ≥44px; no hover-only affordances.
6. **Voice**: Read headings aloud — if they could apply to any competitor, rewrite.

---

## Pre-Delivery Checklist

Before presenting any UI code, verify every item:

```
[ ] Design thinking completed (register + category identified, scene sentence written, color strategy + tone stated)
[ ] No banned patterns (Inter, purple gradients, emoji icons, empty heroes, 3-col card grids)
[ ] No side-stripe borders, gradient text, nested cards, or reflexive modals
[ ] Font pairing is distinctive and matches category
[ ] Icons from real SVG library (Lucide, Heroicons, Phosphor)
[ ] Hero and feature areas have imagery or decorative fills
[ ] Color palette uses CSS variables, tinted grays, no pure #000/#FFF
[ ] Sections share consistent max-width and padding
[ ] Responsive: tested mentally at 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px
[ ] Motion animates only transform/opacity with ease-out curves; prefers-reduced-motion respected
[ ] Accessibility: 4.5:1 contrast, visible focus states, form labels
[ ] Cursor pointer on all clickable elements
[ ] Hover states provide clear visual feedback (not just opacity)
[ ] No secondary slop: blob trio hero, stacked glass panels, fake logo wall, motion soup
[ ] If shadcn/MUI/Radix: colors/radius mapped to tokens, components not rewritten unnecessarily
[ ] Empty / error / loading states are specific and actionable, not generic placeholders
[ ] Slop second pass completed (sameness, proof, accent discipline, category reflex, touch, voice)
```

## Quick Reference

```
READ    -> package.json, tailwind.config, existing fonts/icons
MATCH   -> Register (brand vs product) + Category Design Guide table
COMMIT  -> Scene sentence + color strategy + tone + memorable element
BUILD   -> Category palette + fonts + Taste Layer principles
CHECK   -> Pre-Delivery Checklist (no slop, no banned patterns)

BANNED  -> Inter, Roboto, Arial, purple gradients, emoji icons,
           empty heroes, 3-col card grids, thick gray borders,
           colored-circle avatars, pure #000/#FFF,
           blob trio heroes, nested glass, fake logos, generic SaaS copy,
           side-stripe borders, gradient text, nested cards,
           hero-metric template, modal-as-first-thought

ALWAYS  -> Real SVG icons, tinted grays (toward brand hue), CSS variables,
           responsive, prefers-reduced-motion, 4.5:1 contrast, cursor pointer,
           consistent max-width, distinctive font pairing, ≥1.25 type ratio,
           transform/opacity-only motion with ease-out curves,
           tokens over ripping UI kits, second-pass slop scan
