# AGENTS.md

Conventions for coding agents (and human contributors) working in this repository. This
complements [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md), which
cover the full contribution workflow and local environment setup.

## Test markers

Tests are organized with `pytest` markers declared in `pyproject.toml` under
`[tool.pytest.ini_options]`. The two markers that matter most for scoping a run are:

* `unit` — a unit test. These have no external dependencies and should run fast.
* `integration` — an integration test, typically exercising a real backend or an end-to-end
  code path.

Other markers of note:

* `slow` — a test that takes longer than 1 second.
* Backend-specific markers identify tests that depend on a particular execution engine or
  external service, for example `postgresql`, `mysql`, `sql_server`, `snowflake`, `bigquery`,
  `redshift`, `databricks`, `spark`, `spark_connect`, `trino`, `clickhouse`, `singlestore`,
  `athena`, `sqlite`, and `generic_sql`. A test carries one of these markers when it requires
  that backend to be available (e.g., credentials, a running database, or an installed
  optional dependency).

Select or deselect tests by marker expression with `pytest -m`. For example:

```bash
# Run only unit tests
pytest -m unit

# Run everything except slow tests
pytest -m "not slow"

# Run postgresql-dependent tests only
pytest -m postgresql

# Run unit tests, excluding anything also marked slow
pytest -m "unit and not slow"
```

When adding a new test, mark it accurately: `unit` for a fast, dependency-free test; `integration`
plus the relevant backend marker(s) for anything that talks to a real or emulated backend.

## Compatibility-shim import rule

Optional third-party dependencies (e.g., `sqlalchemy`, `pyspark`, cloud-provider SDKs) must not
be imported directly in library code. Instead, import them via the corresponding module under
`great_expectations/compatibility/`, which wraps the import in a `try`/`except ImportError` and
falls back to a `NotImported` sentinel (see `great_expectations/compatibility/not_imported.py`)
when the dependency isn't installed.

This lets `great_expectations/compatibility/sqlalchemy.py` (and its siblings) be imported
unconditionally — the module itself never raises at import time — while any code path that
actually *uses* a missing symbol raises a clear `ModuleNotFoundError` with an install hint, only
at the point of use. This is what allows Great Expectations to degrade gracefully when an
optional dependency isn't installed, rather than failing at import time for users who don't
need that backend.

In practice:

```python
# Correct
from great_expectations.compatibility import sqlalchemy
...
engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(...)

# Incorrect — do not do this in library code
import sqlalchemy
```

If you need a symbol from an optional dependency that isn't yet exposed in the matching
`great_expectations/compatibility/<library>.py` module, add it there following the existing
`try`/`except (ImportError, AttributeError)` pattern rather than importing the library directly
at the call site.

## Fluent API location

The Fluent Datasources API — the primary interface for configuring datasources and data assets —
lives under `great_expectations/datasource/fluent/`. Changes to datasource or data-asset
configuration behavior generally belong there.

## Local lint and type-checking commands

This project uses `invoke` tasks (defined in `tasks.py`) for linting, formatting, and type
checking, backed by `ruff` and `mypy`. Run these before submitting a change:

```bash
# Lint (ruff check), including formatting
invoke lint

# Check formatting only, without modifying files
invoke fmt --check

# Type-check with mypy, using the same flags as CI
invoke type-check --ci --pretty
```

`invoke lint` runs `ruff format` followed by `ruff check` by default. Pass `--fix` to
`invoke lint` to have `ruff check` attempt automatic fixes.

## Integration test requirement

A behavioral change to a data source, a validation mechanic, or an Expectation requires at
least one integration test in `tests/integration/data_sources_and_expectations`. This directory
contains the shared test utilities and fixtures for exercising Expectations and validation
behavior against real (or realistically emulated) backends, rather than relying solely on unit
tests with mocked components.

If a change of this kind genuinely cannot be covered by a test in that directory, the pull
request description must explain why and describe what coverage exists instead. Don't discover
this exception in review — call it out up front.

## Before opening a pull request

The repository's pull-request template
([`.github/pull_request_template.md`](./.github/pull_request_template.md)) carries the full
checklist. Read it before opening a pull request — many tools compose a pull-request body
programmatically and never load the template, so its contents won't reach you automatically.

The items below are the ones most often missed when a pull request is opened without the
template in hand.

### The CLA must be signed before the pull request is opened

Every contributor must sign the project's Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before their
first pull request can be merged. It grants the project the right to distribute the
contribution; without it the change cannot be accepted, no matter how good it is. Signing is
one-time per contributor and takes a couple of minutes:

* [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://forms.gle/wvregSivqgAaJNEX8), or
* [Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement](https://forms.gle/tFdJftyGYm2otPKA8)
  if the work is being contributed on behalf of an employer.

Once signed, comment `@cla-bot check` on the pull request so the check re-runs. See
[CLA.md](./CLA.md) for the full text.

**If you are an agent, this is a hard stop.** The CLA is a legal affirmation by the human on
whose behalf you are working — you cannot sign it, agree to it, or complete it for them. Before
running `gh pr create` (or otherwise opening a pull request), confirm with that person that they
have signed the CLA under the GitHub account the pull request will be authored by. If they have
not, or you cannot reach them to ask, **stop and do not open the pull request.** Report that the
work is ready and blocked on the CLA, and leave opening it to them.

Unsigned pull requests are the most common way contributions stall here: an agent opens a
substantive change, no one signs, and the work sits unmergeable until it is closed. Getting the
CLA signed first is what keeps that from happening to yours.

### Some changes require an RFC before implementation

An RFC (Request For Comment) is a design proposal discussed and agreed **before** code is
written, so that a contributor doesn't invest in an approach the project won't take. An RFC is
required for:

* Breaking changes to a public API
* Adding support for a new data source or execution engine
* Changes to a canonical JSON schema's version
* Cross-cutting architectural decisions that affect multiple subsystems

An RFC is *not* required for bug fixes, additive non-breaking API changes, new Expectations that
conform to the existing Expectation interface, documentation changes, or performance changes
that don't alter behavior.

If a change falls in the required list, open an RFC in the **Request For Comment** category of
GitHub Discussions and reach agreement there before opening the pull request. Link the accepted
RFC from the pull-request description. If the change looks like it's in the required list but
isn't (for example, it touches a datasource module while only fixing a bug), say so explicitly
in the description — a reviewer shouldn't have to infer it.

The full criteria and process live in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#requesting-comment-on-larger-changes), which is the
authoritative source; this section summarizes it.

A `pr-hygiene` check runs on every pull request and flags changes that look like they cross the
RFC threshold — adding a new `great_expectations/compatibility/` module, a new fluent datasource,
or a new `reqs/requirements-dev-*.txt` file. The check is satisfied by a description line reading
either `RFC: <link>` or `No RFC needed: <reason>`.

### Title prefix

The pull-request title must be prefixed with one of `[BUGFIX]`, `[FEATURE]`, `[DOCS]`,
`[MAINTENANCE]`, `[CONTRIB]`, or `[MINORBUMP]`. The release process reads these prefixes when
generating the changelog.

### Don't edit the changelog

`docs/docusaurus/docs/oss/changelog.md` is generated by the release process from merged
pull-request metadata. No individual pull request should modify it.
