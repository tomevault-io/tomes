# Webflow Editor Integration

This skill explains how to ensure your custom code doesn't interfere with the Webflow Designer/Editor while providing full functionality on the published site.

## Editor Detection

Import `handleEditor` from `@webflow/detect-editor`:

```typescript
import { handleEditor } from "@webflow/detect-editor";

export default function (element: HTMLElement, dataset: DOMStringMap) {
  handleEditor((isEditor) => {
    if (isEditor) {
      // Designer Mode: disable interactions, reset animations
      element.style.pointerEvents = "none";
      element.style.transform = "none";
      element.style.opacity = "1";
    } else {
      // Published Mode: enable functionality
      element.style.pointerEvents = "auto";
    }
  });
}
```
