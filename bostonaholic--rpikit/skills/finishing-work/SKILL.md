# Finishing Work

Verify tests, present options, execute chosen workflow, clean up.

## Purpose

Implementation without proper completion leaves work in limbo. This skill provides structured options for finishing
work: merge locally, create PR, defer for later, or discard. Each option has specific procedures and cleanup
requirements.

## Prerequisites

Before using this skill, verify:

1. All implementation steps completed
2. All verifications passed
3. Code review completed (if applicable)
4. Security review completed (if applicable)

**Do not proceed with failing tests.** Fix them first.

## The Completion Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Tests Pass

Run the full test suite:

```text
Run: [project test command]
Verify: Exit code 0, all tests pass
```

**If tests fail**: Stop. Do not proceed until tests pass.

### Step 2: Identify Base Branch

Determine the target branch for integration:

```text
Common targets:
- main (most common)
- master (legacy naming)
- develop (gitflow)
- [feature-branch] (nested features)
```

Check git configuration or ask if unclear.

### Step 3: Present Options

Present exactly four options without elaboration:

1. **Merge locally** - Merge to base branch on local machine
2. **Create pull request** - Push and open PR for review
3. **Keep for later** - Leave branch as-is to continue later
4. **Discard work** - Delete branch and changes

Use AskUserQuestion to get user's choice.

### Step 4: Execute Chosen Option

#### Option 1: Merge Locally

```text
1. Checkout base branch
   git checkout [base-branch]

2. Pull latest changes
   git pull origin [base-branch]

3. Merge feature branch
   git merge [feature-branch]

4. Run tests on merged result
   [project test command]

5. If tests pass, push
   git push origin [base-branch]

6. Delete feature branch
   git branch -d [feature-branch]
   git push origin --delete [feature-branch]
```

**Never merge without verifying tests pass on the result.**

#### Option 2: Create Pull Request

```text
1. Push feature branch
   git push -u origin [feature-branch]

2. Create PR using gh CLI
   gh pr create --title "[title]" --body "[description]"

3. Report PR URL to user

4. Keep branch active for PR review
```

Do NOT delete the branch after creating PR.

#### Option 3: Keep for Later

```text
1. Commit any uncommitted changes
   git add -A && git commit -m "WIP: [description]"

2. Push to remote (backup)
   git push -u origin [feature-branch]

3. Note current state for later
   - Branch name
   - What's done
   - What remains
```

Do NOT delete the branch.

#### Option 4: Discard Work

```text
1. Confirm with user (require typed confirmation)
   "Type 'DISCARD' to confirm deletion of all changes"

2. If confirmed:
   git checkout [base-branch]
   git branch -D [feature-branch]
   git push origin --delete [feature-branch] (if pushed)

3. Clean up any worktree if applicable
```

**Require explicit confirmation.** This is destructive.

### Step 5: Clean Up

Cleanup depends on the chosen option:

| Option | Cleanup Action |
|--------|----------------|
| Merge locally | Delete feature branch, remove worktree if used |
| Create PR | Keep branch, keep worktree if used |
| Keep for later | Keep branch, keep worktree if used |
| Discard work | Delete branch, remove worktree if used |

#### Worktree Cleanup (if applicable)

If work was done in a git worktree:

```text
1. Exit the worktree directory
   cd [main-repository]

2. Remove the worktree
   git worktree remove [worktree-path]

3. Verify removal
   git worktree list
```

Only remove worktree for merge (Option 1) and discard (Option 4).

## Integration with Implement Phase

This skill is the natural endpoint of the implement phase:

```text
Implementation complete
→ Code review passed
→ Security review passed
→ Use finishing-work skill
→ Choose completion option
→ Execute and clean up
```

## Safety Guardrails

### Never Merge with Failing Tests

```text
If tests fail after merge:
1. Do NOT push
2. Reset the merge: git merge --abort
3. Investigate failures
4. Fix before attempting merge again
```

### Never Force Push to Shared Branches

```text
Avoid: git push --force origin main
This rewrites history and breaks collaborators.

If needed, use: git push --force-with-lease
This fails if remote has new commits.
```

### Confirm Before Discarding

```text
Discard is permanent. Require typed confirmation:
"Type 'DISCARD' to confirm"

Do not accept:
- "yes"
- "y"
- "confirm"

Only exact match: "DISCARD"
```

## Status Reporting

After completing the chosen option, report:

```text
Option 1 (Merge):
"Merged [feature-branch] to [base-branch].
Branch deleted. [N] commits integrated."

Option 2 (PR):
"Pull request created: [PR-URL]
Branch [feature-branch] pushed to origin."

Option 3 (Keep):
"Branch [feature-branch] saved for later.
Pushed to origin as backup."

Option 4 (Discard):
"Branch [feature-branch] deleted.
All changes discarded."
```

## Anti-Patterns

### Merging Without Tests

**Wrong**: Merge and hope tests pass
**Right**: Run tests, then merge only if passing

### Leaving Branches Dangling

**Wrong**: Finish work, forget to clean up branches
**Right**: Execute appropriate cleanup for chosen option

### Skipping Confirmation for Discard

**Wrong**: Delete branch immediately when user says "discard"
**Right**: Require explicit "DISCARD" confirmation

### Merging Unreviewed Code

**Wrong**: Merge without code review
**Right**: Complete review process before finishing

### Force Pushing to Shared Branches

**Wrong**: Force push to fix mistakes
**Right**: Use safe alternatives or coordinate with team

## Checklist Before Finishing

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code review completed (if required)
- [ ] Security review completed (if required)
- [ ] Base branch identified
- [ ] Option chosen by user
- [ ] Tests pass after merge (if merging)
- [ ] Appropriate cleanup performed
- [ ] Status reported to user
