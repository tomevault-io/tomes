# Git Commit Creator Skill

Automates the creation of well-structured Git commits for the MCPSpy project.

## Workflow

You should STRICTLY follow the following steps:

1. Understand the commit status through `git status`, `git diff` and `git diff --staged`.
2. Analyze the scope and nature of changes
3. Using `git checkout -b <branch-name>`, create concise branch name with standard prefixes (e.g., `feat`, `chore`, `fix`).
4. Using `git commit -m "<commit-message>"`, create a conventional commit message that accurately reflects the changes.

## Commit Message Convention

- Use standard prefixes: `feat(component):`, `chore:`, `fix(component):`
- Component examples: `library-manager`, `ebpf`, `mcp`, `http`, `output`
- Brackets are optional but recommended for clarity
- Keep titles concise and descriptive

### Examples

- `feat(library-manager): add support for container runtime detection`
- `chore: update dependencies to latest versions`
- `fix(ebpf): handle kernel version compatibility issues`
