    │
    ├─── Impressions (people who see your listing)
    │         │
    │         ▼ [View Rate]
    ├─── Page Views (people who click)
    │         │
    │         ▼ [Click-through Rate]
    ├─── Website Visitors

    │         ▼ [Signup Rate]
    ├─── Signups / Trials

    ├─── Activated Users (reached value)
    │         │

```

### Key Conversion Points

| Stage | Typical Rate | What It Measures |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| View → Click | 15-30% | Listing appeal |
| Click → Visit | 70-90% | Page load, relevance |
| Visit → Signup | 5-15% | Landing page effectiveness |
| Signup → Activation | 30-60% | Onboarding quality |
| Activation → Paid | 10-30% | Product-market fit |

## Setting Up Conversion Tracking

### 1. Define Your Conversions

**Primary Conversion (Pick One):**
- Signup completed
- Trial started
- Purchase made
- App installed

**Secondary Conversions:**
- Email collected
- Demo booked
- Free tier activated
- Feature used

### 2. Technical Implementation

**Google Analytics 4 Events:**
```javascript
// Signup conversion
gtag('event', 'generate_lead', {
  'event_category': 'signup',
  'event_label': 'producthunt',
  'value': 0
});

// Purchase conversion
gtag('event', 'purchase', {
  'transaction_id': 'T_12345',
  'value': 99.00,
  'currency': 'USD',
  'items': [{
    'item_name': 'Pro Plan',
    'price': 99.00
  }]
});
```

**Server-Side Tracking:**
```python
# When signup occurs
def track_signup(user, source):
    analytics.track(user.id, 'Signed Up', {
        'source': source,  # 'producthunt'
        'plan': user.plan,
        'timestamp': datetime.now()
    })
```

### 3. Attribution Setup

**First-Touch Attribution:**
- Capture source on first visit
- Store in cookie/database
- Associate with eventual conversion

**UTM Tracking:**
```
https://yoursite.com?utm_source=producthunt&utm_medium=launch&utm_campaign=jan2024
```

**Referrer Tracking:**
```javascript
// Capture referrer on page load
if (document.referrer.includes('producthunt.com')) {
  localStorage.setItem('acquisition_source', 'producthunt');
}
```

## Measuring Conversions

### Real-Time Tracking (Launch Day)

**Hourly Log Template:**

| Hour | PH Visitors | Signups | Conv Rate | Revenue |
|------|-------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| 00:00 | 45 | 3 | 6.7% | $0 |
| 01:00 | 89 | 7 | 7.9% | $99 |
| 02:00 | 67 | 5 | 7.5% | $0 |
| ... | | | | |
| Total | | | | |

### Conversion Rate Calculations

**Visitor to Signup Rate:**
```
Signup Rate = (Signups / PH Visitors) × 100

Example: 156 signups / 1,234 visitors = 12.6%
```

**Trial to Paid Rate:**
```
Conversion Rate = (Paid / Trials) × 100

Example: 23 paid / 156 trials = 14.7%
```

**Revenue per Visitor:**
```
RPV = Total Revenue / Total Visitors

Example: $2,277 / 1,234 = $1.85 per visitor
```

## Funnel Analysis

### Identifying Drop-Offs

**Funnel Visualization:**
```
PH Page Views:     2,500 (100%)
                      │
                      ▼ 49% continue
Website Visits:    1,234 (49%)
                      │
                      ▼ 38% continue
Engaged (>30s):      469 (19%)
                      │
                      ▼ 33% continue
Signup Started:      156 (6.2%)
                      │
                      ▼ 90% complete
Signup Done:         140 (5.6%)
                      │
                      ▼ 16% convert
Paid:                 23 (0.9%)
```

**Drop-Off Analysis:**
- PH → Site: 51% drop → Is listing compelling?
- Site → Engaged: 62% drop → Is landing page relevant?
- Engaged → Signup: 67% drop → Is CTA clear?
- Signup → Complete: 10% drop → Is form too long?
- Complete → Paid: 84% drop → Is value delivered?

### Optimization Opportunities

For each drop-off point:

1. **High Drop-Off?** → Investigate why
2. **Identify Pattern** → What's different about converters?
3. **Hypothesis** → What change might help?
4. **Test** → A/B test the change
5. **Measure** → Did conversion improve?

## ROI Calculation

### Basic ROI Formula

```
Launch ROI = (Revenue Generated - Costs) / Costs × 100
```

### Comprehensive ROI Analysis

**Revenue Side:**
```
Immediate Revenue:
- Direct purchases: $2,277

Projected Revenue (LTV-based):
- 23 customers × $480 LTV = $11,040

Total Value: $13,317
```

**Cost Side:**
```
Time Investment:
- Preparation: 40 hours × $100/hr = $4,000
- Launch day: 16 hours × $100/hr = $1,600
- Follow-up: 8 hours × $100/hr = $800

Direct Costs:
- Design assets: $500
- Tools/subscriptions: $100
- Promotional offer cost: $300

Total Costs: $7,300
```

**ROI Calculation:**
```
ROI = ($13,317 - $7,300) / $7,300 × 100 = 82.4%
```

### Customer Acquisition Cost

```
CAC from PH = Total Launch Costs / Customers Acquired
            = $7,300 / 23
            = $317.39 per customer
```

**Compare to Other Channels:**
| Channel | CAC | Quality |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Product Hunt | $317 | High |
| Google Ads | $150 | Medium |
| Content Marketing | $200 | High |
| Cold Outreach | $500 | Low |

## Cohort Analysis

### PH Users vs Other Sources

| Activation Rate | 45% | 38% | 28% |
| Day 7 Retention | 35% | 32% | 22% |
| Day 30 Retention | 25% | 24% | 15% |
| Upgrade Rate | 18% | 12% | 8% |
