description: Convert an approved SPEC.md into an ordered, checkable step list (CHECKLIST.md) where each step has one done-criterion. Use after SPEC.md, and again (partial re-plan) after a validation failure. Use when this capability is needed.

# Plan the steps

Input: SPEC.md (re-read REQUEST.md and SPEC.md in full first). Output:
CHECKLIST.md — the complete ordered path from the current tree to the
accepted change. Execution will do NOTHING that is not a step here, so
missing steps here means missed work later. Plan against that.

## Ordering rules

1. Dependencies first, verification interleaved: a step that writes a
   test precedes the step whose change it guards; a step that runs a
   check follows immediately after the change it checks — not batched
   at the end where failures lose their cause.
2. One step = one action with ONE done-criterion (a command and its
   expected output, or "file exists containing <marker>"). If a step
   needs the word "and", split it.
3. Include the boring steps that get forgotten — they are the point of
   this skill: creating directories, `chmod +x`, updating the ladder
   or docs SPEC says to update, retiring an occupied run root (rename
   commit FIRST), the subsystem test ring, the FULL gate
   (`pytest tests/ -q -n 4`, expect 0 failed), the tranche commit
   with its message, the push with retry, and the final
   `git status --porcelain` cleanliness check.
4. Every step cites its spec item (S-number). A step with no S-number
   is scope creep — delete it or send it to PARKED.md.
5. **Scope from the map before planning steps.** Open
   `docs/map/INDEX.md`, resolve the change to `DR-SUB-`/`DR-CON-`/
   `DR-SEAM-` ids, and read the seam document before the subsystem
   ones — the file is `docs/map/SEAM-<a>-x-<b>.md`, sides in
   alphabetical order, and the worked recipe for a seam change is
   `docs/map/REC-change-a-seam.md`. Name those ids in CHECKLIST.md's
   header so execution starts from the same map the plan was built on.
   A change whose ids you cannot name is a change you have not scoped.
6. **Plan the map update as part of the step that changes behaviour**,
   never as a trailing "update docs" step. A trailing documentation
   step is the one that gets dropped when a tranche runs long. If a
   seam document must be CREATED, that is its own step, and it comes
   BEFORE the code steps — writing down the agreement is how you find
   out whether you understand it.
7. Mark checkpoint steps `[COMMIT]` at natural boundaries (at minimum:
   after tests-written, after each spec item lands, after the gate) —
   rationale canonical in `dr-drive-harness` §1.

## CHECKLIST.md template

    # Checklist for: <request headline>
    State: next=<step n> blockers=<none | one line>   <- refreshed at
    every commit; a fresh session resumes from this line alone
    Re-read REQUEST.md + SPEC.md before every step. Execute strictly
    in order. One step per dr-execute-step invocation.

    - [ ] 1. (S1) <action>
          done-when: <command> -> <expected>
    - [ ] 2. (S1) [COMMIT] <action>
          done-when: ...
    - [ ] 3. (S2) ...
    ...
    - [ ] N-2. (all) Map check: python tools/docs_verify.py
          done-when: 0 failed, and --audit reports 0 findings
    - [ ] N-1. (all) Full gate: pytest tests/ -q -n 4
          done-when: output ends "N passed, 0 failed" (paste it)
    - [ ] N. (all) [COMMIT] push and confirm clean tree
          done-when: git status --porcelain is empty AND branch head
          is on origin

## Re-planning after a validation failure

Touch only the steps implicated by the failure: append new steps
(N+1...) that correct course; never rewrite history of checked steps —
their pasted outputs are the audit trail.

## Exit criteria

- CHECKLIST.md committed and pushed; every S-number covered by >=1
  step; every step has a done-criterion.
- No code changed in this phase.
- Return to the orchestrator.
