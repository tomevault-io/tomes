description: Typing an open-item queue - which items are decisions, which are riders, which are notes - without shrinking it (FR-22). Use for any "what is actually on the desk" document. The source cycle's first map understated its queue by more than half. Use when this capability is needed.

# Decision Mapping (new in 0.5, from FR-22)

<!-- PROMPT-CORE-BEGIN -->
A queue map is DERIVED: the pins are the record, and where the map and
a pin disagree, the pin wins. The map's characteristic failure is
making the queue look smaller than it is; every rule here exists
because that happened.

1. THE RIDER TEST: an item rides on a root only if EVERY answer to the
   root determines it. "It arises only once the pin is admitted" is a
   DIFFERENT, weaker edge - name it as such. An item no answer
   determines is independent, however related it feels.
2. THREE TIERS, not two: ADMISSION (is this route accepted at all - and
   this tier sits ABOVE shape: refuse admission and the shape question
   is never asked), SHAPE (given admission, which form), FREEZE-TIME
   WORK (follows admission; determined by no answer; it is scheduled,
   not cleared, by any decision).
3. ELIMINATIONS are the map's strongest claims - that a question ceases
   to exist. Verify one per OPTION of the root, not just the favoured
   option; a question that survives under any option is not eliminated.
4. SHARED-CAUSE claims name the shared FACT and the test that measures
   it on each side. Two obstacles with different facts (a missing join
   is not a cardinality ceiling) are two questions; fusing them is how
   a reversal gets re-imported after its source refused it.
5. One counting rule per table, stated. Counting one row's notes as
   cleared items while another row has none is how an ordering gets
   flattered. Every total recomputed, never remembered (FR-26).
6. ORDERINGS are preferences unless derived. Give the criteria, show
   which order each criterion yields, and name the chooser. Demoting an
   item a source ranks first requires an argument, not a table cell.
7. The map ships a STALENESS GUARD on its inventory (every source item
   classified exactly once; no invented items) and states the guard's
   limit: inventory is checkable, classification is not - adversarial
   review is what checks classification, and the map records what that
   review removed (a map is only as trustworthy as its known failures).
