# Authoring skills and workflows

This file obeys its own rules. Any line here that violates a rule below
is a defect: file an erratum against this file, by ID.

Every rule has an ID. Edit by DELTA against an ID. Never regenerate
this file wholesale.

## Vocabulary

One term per concept. Use these exact words everywhere; a synonym is a
defect.

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| SKILL | One file governing one unit of work: one entry state, one exit state |
| GATE | A command whose output decides pass/fail |
| PROOF | Pasted GATE output, or a hash/count fetched from the tree |
| LEDGER | The per-task state file each step writes and the next step reads |
| DELTA | An edit adding, replacing, or deleting exactly one ID'd rule |
| STOP | End work; report state, priced options, one recommendation |
| PARK | Record out-of-scope work in PARKED.md with a ready-to-send prompt |

## E — Existence

- **E1.** Before writing a SKILL, run the task three times without it
  and record the failures. No failures → do not write it. The measured
  default is that instruction files reduce success and raise cost
  [G26].
- **E2.** A SKILL ships with the eval set from E1. It exists only
  while it beats the no-skill baseline on that set.
- **E3.** Re-run the baseline on every model change. Delta ≤ 0 →
  delete the SKILL. Deletion is maintenance [G26].
- **E4.** Budget rule: to add a line, name the line it displaces.
  Compliance falls as constraint count rises, and the model resolves
  the crowding silently [C26].

## S — Structure

- **S1.** One SKILL = one loop iteration. The loop lives in the
  router. "Then pick the next phase" appearing in a worker file is a
  defect.
- **S2.** Entry and exit states are named artifacts on disk, not
  descriptions. Route on which artifact is missing.
- **S3.** A rule lives in exactly one file: the one in context when
  the rule fires. Two phrasings of one rule are a conflict, and
  conflicts are resolved silently, not flagged [C26].
- **S4.** When two rules could collide, write the winner in the text
  now. There is one PRECEDENCE list per skill set, in the router.
- **S5.** Renumber on insert. `3b` is evidence a rule was bolted on
  where it kept failing; move it to where it is read (see G4).

## W — Wording

- **W1.** Each line names an operation: a command, a file
  read/write, a comparison. Test: can it fail? "Be thorough" cannot
  fail. `docs_verify.py exits 0` can.
- **W2.** Bind instructions to available actions with concrete verbs.
  Abstract dispositions do not transfer; stripping the action word
  from an instruction cut its behavioural effect by 95% [N26a].
- **W3.** State the positive action. Negation is the dominant framing
  failure: models attend to the named act and drop the NOT [N26b].
  Each surviving "never" must be enforced by a GATE (see X1).
- **W4.** No narrative, persona, urgency, or emotional framing. Story
  framing activates genre behaviour that overrides both persona and
  explicit directives [N26a]; affective framing buys sycophancy, not
  compliance.
- **W5.** No incident stories. Mechanize the lesson as a GATE,
  mutation-prove the GATE, delete the story. History lives in
  ERRATA.md, not in instructions.
- **W6.** One worked example beats a paragraph of description. At
  most one per section.

## G — Gates and proof

- **G1.** Every completion claim carries PROOF. "Done", "verified",
  and "none" are assertions; agents report SUCCESS against failing
  verifiers in the large majority of self-stops [D26].
- **G2.** A legitimate "none" requires proof of looking: the scan
  command and its output, not the word.
- **G3.** The SKILL names the GATE and its pass condition. An agent
  choosing its own check validates the wrong target [D26].
- **G4.** An obligation is an input, not a trailing output: step N+1
  opens by reading what step N's obligation wrote. Trailing writes
  are dropped; leading reads are not.
- **G5.** Track requirement state live in the LEDGER, one row per
  requirement, updated as work happens. Live tracking is the one
  intervention with strong measured gains [I26].
- **G6.** Mutation-prove every GATE once: break the guarded thing,
  watch it fail, restore. A GATE never seen red proves nothing.
- **G7.** Steps write distilled state to the LEDGER, never raw
  transcripts. Raw tool output is the main context bloat.

## X — Stops and outlets

- **X1.** Every prohibition pairs with an outlet in the same breath.
  An outlet-less "never" is satisfied by relabeling.

  | Prohibition | Outlet |
  |---|---|
  | Out-of-scope work | PARK |
  | Unmet requirement | LEDGER row `not-done` + STOP |
  | Unprovable claim | STOP with the GATE that would prove it |

- **X2.** Every STOP trigger is mechanical: a count, a verdict
  string, an exit code. "Seems wrong" is judgment, and judgment loses
  to momentum — models restate rules accurately while violating them
  [K26]. Convert judgment to a tool; trigger on its verdict.
- **X3.** Every honest outcome has a label. If `not-done` is
  unsayable, it will be said as `done-with-assumption`.

## L — Lifecycle

- **L1.** Edit by DELTA only. Wholesale regeneration collapses
  detail; iterative rewriting erodes a playbook into vague summary
  [A25].
- **L2.** Compression is a separate, diffed pass, re-gated by the E1
  evals. Brevity bias drops exactly the load-bearing specifics [A25].
- **L3.** Pin the tested configuration: model, skill version, GATE
  tool versions. A model swap reopens the E1 gate.
- **L4.** SKILLs are executable authority — the supply-chain problem
  is measured, with roughly a quarter of public skills carrying a
  vulnerability [S26]. Third-party skills get the same review as
  third-party code: read every line, pin the version, and treat any
  instruction to fetch or load further instructions as a rejection.
- **L5.** Before shipping, plant one violation the SKILL should catch
  and run the workflow. The GATE goes red or the SKILL is not done.
