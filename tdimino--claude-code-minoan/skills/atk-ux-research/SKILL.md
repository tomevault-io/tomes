# America's Test Kitchen UX Research

Modular skill for conducting UX research on any ATK feature or experience area.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Researching user feedback for any ATK feature (equipment, recipes, subscription, app, etc.)
- Gathering app store reviews (iOS/Android)
- Scraping Reddit discussions about ATK
- Collecting BBB complaints and Trustpilot reviews
- Creating UX research reports with findings and recommendations
- Comparing ATK to competitors (NYT Cooking, Serious Eats, etc.)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run research on a specific feature area
python3 ~/.claude/skills/atk-ux-research/scripts/atk_research.py --feature "recipes"
python3 ~/.claude/skills/atk-ux-research/scripts/atk_research.py --feature "subscription"
python3 ~/.claude/skills/atk-ux-research/scripts/atk_research.py --feature "app experience"
```

## Feature Areas

| Feature | Description | Key Sources |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `equipment` | Kitchen gear and product reviews | App stores, Reddit, BBB |
| `recipes` | Recipe content and usability | Reddit, App stores |
| `subscription` | Billing, pricing, cancellation | BBB, Trustpilot, Reddit |
| `app` | App stability, UX, navigation | App stores, Reddit |
| `video` | TV shows, streaming, video content | Reddit, social media |
| `cookbooks` | Physical book purchases and quality | Reddit, Trustpilot |

## Research Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Collection

#### 1.1 App Store Reviews

```bash
# iOS App Store
firecrawl https://apps.apple.com/us/app/americas-test-kitchen/id1365223384

# Google Play Store
firecrawl https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.americastestkitchen.groceryapp
```

#### 1.2 Review Sites

```bash
# Trustpilot
firecrawl https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.americastestkitchen.com

# BBB Complaints
firecrawl https://www.bbb.org/us/ma/boston/profile/publishers-periodical/americas-test-kitchen-lp-0021-66446/complaints
```

#### 1.3 Reddit (JSON API)

Reddit blocks standard scrapers. Use the `.json` suffix:

```bash
# Get subreddit posts
curl -s "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmericasTestKitchen/top.json?t=year&limit=25" \
  -H "User-Agent: ux-research/1.0" | python3 -c "
import sys, json
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
for post in data['data']['children']:
    p = post['data']
    print(f\"**{p['title']}** (score: {p['score']}, comments: {p['num_comments']})\")
    print(f\"  https://reddit.com{p['permalink']}\n\")"

# Get thread comments
curl -s "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmericasTestKitchen/comments/THREAD_ID.json?limit=50" \
  -H "User-Agent: ux-research/1.0" | python3 -c "
import sys, json
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
comments = data[1]['data']['children']
for c in comments[:20]:
    if c['kind'] == 't1':
        d = c['data']
        print(f\"**{d['author']}** (score: {d['score']}):\n{d['body'][:500]}\n---\")"

# Search for feature-specific discussions
curl -s "https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/search.json?q=america%27s+test+kitchen+FEATURE&restrict_sr=0&limit=20" \
  -H "User-Agent: ux-research/1.0"
```

**Key Subreddits:**
- r/AmericasTestKitchen - Dedicated ATK community
- r/Cooking - General cooking discussions
- r/Costco - Cookbook/product finds
- r/BuyItForLife - Equipment durability
- r/AskCulinary - Recipe questions

#### 1.4 Exa Search

```bash
# Neural search for user feedback
python3 ~/.claude/skills/exa-search/scripts/exa_search.py \
  "America's Test Kitchen FEATURE user feedback reviews" \
  --category news -n 15

# Research with citations
python3 ~/.claude/skills/exa-search/scripts/exa_research.py \
  "What do users say about America's Test Kitchen FEATURE?" \
  --sources --markdown
```

#### 1.5 Perplexity MCP

```
mcp__perplexity__search: "America's Test Kitchen FEATURE user complaints feedback"
mcp__perplexity__get_documentation: "ATK app store reviews analysis"
```

### Phase 2: Analysis

#### 2.1 Quantitative Metrics

| Metric | Source | How to Get |
|--------|--------|------------|
| iOS Rating | App Store | Firecrawl scrape |
| Android Rating | Google Play | Firecrawl scrape |
| BBB Complaints | BBB | Count from scrape |
| Trustpilot Score | Trustpilot | Firecrawl scrape |
| Reddit Engagement | Reddit JSON | Sum scores/comments |

#### 2.2 Qualitative Themes

Code feedback into themes:
- **Discoverability** - Can users find the feature?
- **Usability** - Is it easy to use?
- **Reliability** - Does it work consistently?
- **Value** - Is it worth the price?
- **Support** - How are issues resolved?

#### 2.3 Severity Classification

| Severity | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| Critical | Prevents core functionality, multiple sources confirm |
| High | Significant friction, frequent complaints |
| Medium | Annoyance, moderate complaint frequency |
| Low | Nice-to-have improvements |

### Phase 3: Report Generation

Use template at: `~/.claude/skills/atk-ux-research/templates/report-template.md`

#### Report Sections

1. **Executive Summary** - Key findings, severity table
2. **Methodology** - Sources, sample sizes, limitations
3. **Quantitative Overview** - Ratings, complaint distribution
4. **Feature Analysis** - Deep dive on researched feature
5. **User Pain Points** - Themed complaints with evidence
6. **Positive Feedback** - What users appreciate
7. **Recommendations** - Prioritized improvements
8. **Appendix** - Source URLs, raw data references

## Output Locations

```
~/Desktop/ATK-UX-Research/
├── reports/                    # Generated reports

## Competitor Comparison

When benchmarking, compare against:

| Competitor | Focus | URL |
|------------|-------|-----|
| NYT Cooking | Recipes, no equipment | cooking.nytimes.com |
| Serious Eats | Recipes + equipment | seriouseats.com |
| Wirecutter | Equipment only | nytimes.com/wirecutter |
| Consumer Reports | Equipment reviews | consumerreports.org |
| King Arthur | Baking focus | kingarthurbaking.com |

## Known Limitations

- **Facebook Groups**: Not accessible via API, requires manual research
- **App Store Historical Data**: Need AppFollow/Sensor Tower for trends
- **Reddit Rate Limits**: Use 2-second delays between requests
- **Trustpilot**: Limited ATK reviews (only 4 as of Jan 2026)
