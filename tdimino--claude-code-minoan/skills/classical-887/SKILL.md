# Classical 887

Check what's playing on WRHV 88.7 FM (Classical WMHT) — the classical music station in the Hudson Valley. Queries the NPR Composer API for real-time playlist data and provides clickable links to listen on YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, IMSLP, IDAGIO, Internet Archive, and Musopen.

## When to Use

- Checking what's playing right now on 88.7
- Getting recent tracks with links to listen again
- Building a Markdown playlist report
- Finding a specific piece heard on the radio
- Creating Spotify playlists from radio tracks
- Renaming Spotify playlists
- Auditing owned Spotify playlists (list, search, sort)
- Cleaning up accumulated Spotify playlists (safe bulk removal)
- Exporting playlist track data to JSON before cleanup
- Reviewing playlist operation history

## Prerequisites

- `requests` Python package (`uv pip install --system requests`)
- No API key required — uses NPR's public Composer API
- **Spotify integration (optional):** `spotipy` package (`uv pip install --system spotipy`) + Spotify Developer App credentials

## Output

Default shows: composer, piece, performers, duration, and listen links (YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, IMSLP, IDAGIO, Internet Archive, Musopen).

Markdown report includes: now-playing header, recent tracks table with 7 platform links, and a composer index.

## Playlist Log

Every `--spotify-playlist` operation automatically appends a JSONL entry to `~/.claude/skills/classical-887/playlist-log.jsonl`. Each entry records:

- Date and action (created/appended)
- Playlist name and Spotify URL
- Tracks added (composer, piece, performers, duration, Spotify URI)
- Tracks not found on Spotify
- Total counts (matched/unmatched)

View the log as a Markdown report with `--spotify-log-report`. The log file is append-only and can be queried with standard `jq` commands:

```bash
# Count total operations
wc -l ~/.claude/skills/classical-887/playlist-log.jsonl

# Show all playlist names used
cat ~/.claude/skills/classical-887/playlist-log.jsonl | jq -r '.playlist_name' | sort -u

# Total tracks matched across all operations
cat ~/.claude/skills/classical-887/playlist-log.jsonl | jq '.matched_count' | paste -sd+ | bc
```

## Data Source
