# Figma MCP

## Overview

This skill enables accurate design-to-code conversion by leveraging Figma's MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to access structured design data directly from Figma files. Unlike screenshot-based approaches, the Figma MCP provides semantic information about every design element including exact spacing, colors, typography, component hierarchy, and design system tokens, resulting in significantly more accurate code generation.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when users:
- Provide Figma URLs (file links or frame selection links)
- Request converting/implementing Figma designs into code
- Ask to "build this from Figma" or "implement this design"
- Need to extract design tokens, variables, or design system values
- Want to update existing code to match a Figma design
- Mention maintaining design-to-code consistency

## Workflow

### Step 1: Receive Figma Design Reference

When a user provides a Figma URL or requests design implementation:

1. **Identify the Figma link type**:
   - File URL: `https://www.figma.com/file/[FILE_KEY]/...`
   - Frame selection: `https://www.figma.com/file/[FILE_KEY]/...?node-id=[NODE_ID]`
   - Design URL: `https://www.figma.com/design/[FILE_KEY]/...`

2. **Confirm access**:
   - Verify the Figma MCP server is configured and accessible
   - If not configured, reference `references/setup-guide.md` for setup instructions

### Step 2: Fetch Design Data Using MCP Tools

Use the available Figma MCP tools to retrieve structured design data:

**Key MCP Tools Available:**
- **get_figma_data** - Fetch complete design data for a file or specific frame
- **get_figma_variables** - Extract design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- **get_figma_components** - Retrieve component definitions and instances
- **get_figma_styles** - Access text, color, and effect styles

**Best Practice:** Start with `get_figma_data` for the specific frame or node the user referenced. This provides the complete structure, layout data, and styling information.

**Example workflow:**
```
User: "Implement this Figma design: [Figma URL with node-id]"

1. Extract file_key and node_id from URL
2. Call get_figma_data with file_key and node_id parameters
3. Receive structured JSON with:
   - Element hierarchy (frames, groups, components)
   - Layout properties (position, size, constraints, auto-layout)
   - Styling (fills, strokes, effects, typography)
   - Component instances and variants
   - Design tokens and variables
```

### Step 3: Analyze Design Structure

Before generating code, analyze the fetched design data:

1. **Identify component hierarchy**:
   - What are the main containers/sections?
   - Which elements are reusable components?
   - How does the layout flow (flex, grid, absolute)?

2. **Extract design system values**:
   - Colors (fills, strokes, backgrounds)
   - Typography (font families, sizes, weights, line heights)
   - Spacing (padding, margins, gaps)
   - Borders, shadows, effects

3. **Determine layout approach**:
   - Auto-layout frames → Flexbox or CSS Grid
   - Absolute positioning → CSS absolute/relative positioning
   - Constraints → Responsive behavior

### Step 4: Generate Code

Generate production-ready code based on the design data:

**Code generation principles:**

1. **Use semantic HTML**:
   - Frames → `<div>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, etc.
   - Text → `<h1>-<h6>`, `<p>`, `<span>`
   - Buttons → `<button>`
   - Images → `<img>`

2. **Preserve design system values**:
   - Extract color variables from Figma variables
   - Create CSS custom properties for spacing, colors, typography
   - Use exact values from design (don't approximate)

3. **Match layout behavior**:
   - Auto-layout with padding/gap → Flexbox with gap/padding
   - Auto-layout direction → flex-direction
   - Constraints → Responsive CSS (flex-grow, min/max-width)

4. **Component-based architecture**:
   - Figma components → React/Vue components or CSS classes
   - Component instances → Component usage with props
   - Variants → Props or conditional classes

5. **Responsive considerations**:
   - Use relative units where appropriate (rem, em, %)
   - Consider breakpoints for desktop/mobile variants
   - Preserve constraint behavior from Figma

**Example output structure:**
```typescript
// For React
import React from 'react';
import './styles.css';

export const ComponentName = () => {
  return (
    <div className="container">
      {/* Preserved hierarchy and styling */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Step 5: Validate and Refine

After generating initial code:

1. **Verify accuracy**:
   - Do spacing values match the design exactly?
   - Are colors accurate (check hex values)?
   - Does the layout behavior match (responsive, wrapping)?

2. **Check for improvements**:
   - Can any values be extracted to CSS variables?
   - Are there repeated patterns that should be componentized?
   - Is the code accessible (semantic HTML, ARIA attributes)?

3. **Offer refinements**:
   - Suggest design system integration if applicable
   - Mention any design inconsistencies detected
   - Propose optimizations (shared styles, component extraction)

## Best Practices

### Design-to-Code Accuracy

- **Never approximate values**: Use exact pixel values, colors, and measurements from Figma data
- **Preserve hierarchy**: Maintain the nesting structure from Figma frames/groups
- **Match auto-layout behavior**: Figma's auto-layout maps directly to Flexbox properties
- **Use design tokens**: Extract and reuse color/spacing variables from Figma Variables

### Code Quality

- **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML elements, not just divs
- **Component extraction**: Identify reusable components from Figma components
- **CSS organization**: Separate layout, typography, and visual styling
- **Accessibility**: Add appropriate ARIA labels and semantic structure

### Design System Integration

- **Check for variables**: Use Figma Variables for design tokens
- **Component consistency**: Match Figma component names to code component names
- **Code Connect**: If available, reference Code Connect mappings for components
- **Naming conventions**: Follow existing project conventions for classes/components

### Performance

- **Optimize images**: Suggest appropriate image formats and compression
- **CSS efficiency**: Avoid redundant styles, use CSS variables
- **Bundle size**: Keep generated code lean and modular

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Landing Page from Figma
```
User provides: Figma link to landing page design
Process:
1. Fetch complete page structure with get_figma_data
2. Identify sections (hero, features, CTA, footer)
3. Generate semantic HTML with section elements
4. Extract colors/typography to CSS variables
5. Implement responsive behavior from constraints
```

### Pattern 2: Component Implementation
```
User provides: Figma link to button component with variants
Process:
1. Fetch component definition with get_figma_components
2. Identify variants (primary, secondary, sizes)
3. Create React component with props for variants
4. Extract shared styles to base component
5. Implement variant-specific styles as props/classes
```

### Pattern 3: Design System Extraction
```
User requests: Extract design tokens from Figma file
Process:
1. Fetch variables with get_figma_variables
2. Fetch text/color styles with get_figma_styles
3. Generate CSS custom properties or theme object
4. Document token naming and usage
5. Export as stylesheet or config file
```

## Troubleshooting

**MCP server not available:**
- Check if Figma MCP server is configured in MCP settings
- Reference `references/setup-guide.md` for setup instructions
- Verify user has appropriate Figma plan (Dev Mode access for official server)

**Design data incomplete:**
- Ensure the Figma file is accessible (permissions)
- Verify the node-id in the URL is correct
- Try fetching parent frame if child node returns limited data

**Code doesn't match design visually:**
- Double-check spacing and sizing values
- Verify color values are exact hex codes from Figma
- Check if fonts are loaded correctly
- Review auto-layout direction and alignment properties
