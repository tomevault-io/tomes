description: Check whether agent telemetry preserves measurement semantics. Use when a user asks whether retries inflate counted usage, whether an operation differs from an attempt, whether token metrics double count a subset (reasoning inside output), whether cache hits or cached replays distort counts, or wants conformance tests for agent metrics and observability claims. 中文触发：遥测语义核查、重试计数、用量口径、token 重复计数、Agent 用量指标一致性检验。 Use when this capability is needed.

# AgentMeasure — Measurement Conformance

This Skill routes measurement-semantics questions to AgentMeasure's local runners. It does not move telemetry anywhere.

## First success (offline, deterministic)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roy-tong/AgentMeasure && cd AgentMeasure
python3 conformance/pack/agentmeasure selftest          # Pack fixtures, PASS / FAIL / UNPROVABLE
python3 conformance/pack/agentmeasure conformance \
  --fixture conformance/vectors/external/urusilla-001/agentmeasure_urusilla_fixture_001.events.jsonl
./examples/demo-e2e.sh                                  # 42 calls -> 84 canonical observations, deterministic
python3 conformance/runners/run_metrics.py              # 21/21 vectors PASS
python3 verify_vectors.py                               # receipts / correlation / operation grouping
```

These commands run locally. The Pack reads the caller-supplied FMT-002 fixture;
`selftest` is deliberately separate and only checks repository fixtures. No
network, cloud, or credentials are required.

## What to check, and where

| Question | Runner / artifact |
| --- | --- |
| Do retries inflate counted usage? (one operation vs N attempts) | `conformance/vectors/metric-execution-grain.json` |
| Does a selection rate claim hold at its grain? | `conformance/vectors/metric-selection-rate.json` |
| Do declared operation summaries reconcile against attempt rows? | `conformance/vectors/external/urusilla-001/` |
| Does an operation-grain metric aggregate at the wrong grain? | `conformance/vectors/external/urusilla-002/` |
| Can this trace safely support an operation count at all? | `conformance/evidence/langfuse-demo-traces/` (the 0%-coverage case) |

Verdict vocabulary: `PASS` / `FAIL` / `UNPROVABLE`. Ambiguity is retained in
the reason for an `UNPROVABLE` finding; it is not a fourth public verdict.
Report `UNPROVABLE` as a finding, never as zero.

## Boundaries

- Local by default. Nothing is uploaded; a sanitized sample is shared only with explicit authorization.
- A short sample check is not a full audit and claims no causal effect.
- The Pack CLI and root GitHub Action are shipped on `main`. Until a release
  tag explicitly includes the Pack, pin the Action to the verified immutable
  commit `2cf476d6f7d0fc45401db5a822e1f12de009ac74` rather than a moving branch.
- Provider-side usage questions (who called, how often, production traffic) start with the zero-install check described in the repository README.
