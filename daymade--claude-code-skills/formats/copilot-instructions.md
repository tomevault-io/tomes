# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a Claude Code skills marketplace containing 48 production-ready skills organized in a plugin marketplace structure. Most plugins expose one skill for narrow installs; suite plugins expose related skills under shared namespaces for combined installation workflows.

**Essential Skill**: `skill-creator` is the most important skill in this marketplace - it's a meta-skill that enables users to create their own skills. Always recommend it first for users interested in extending Claude Code.

## Skills Architecture

### Directory Structure

Each skill follows a standard structure:
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)          # Core skill instructions with YAML frontmatter
├── scripts/ (optional)          # Executable Python/Bash scripts
├── references/ (optional)       # Documentation loaded as needed
└── assets/ (optional)           # Templates and resources for output
```

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern

Skills use a three-level loading system:
1. **Metadata** (name + description in YAML frontmatter) - Always in context
2. **SKILL.md body** - Loaded when skill triggers
3. **Bundled resources** - Loaded as needed by Claude

## Development Commands

### Installation Scripts

**In Claude Code (in-app):**
```text
/plugin marketplace add daymade/claude-code-skills
```

Then:
1. Select **Browse and install plugins**
2. Select **daymade/claude-code-skills**
3. Select **skill-creator**
4. Select **Install now**

**From your terminal (CLI):**
```bash
# Automated installation (macOS/Linux)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daymade/claude-code-skills/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Automated installation (Windows PowerShell)
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daymade/claude-code-skills/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex

# Manual installation
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/daymade/claude-code-skills
# Marketplace name: daymade-skills (from marketplace.json)
claude plugin install skill-creator@daymade-skills
```

### Skill Validation and Packaging

```bash
# Quick validation of a skill
cd skill-creator && uv run --with PyYAML python -m scripts.quick_validate ../skill-name

# Package a skill (includes automatic validation)
cd skill-creator && uv run --with PyYAML python -m scripts.package_skill ../skill-name [output-dir]

# Initialize a new skill from template
uv run python skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>
```

### Testing Skills Locally

```bash
# Add local marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/daymade/claude-code-skills
# Marketplace name: daymade-skills (from marketplace.json)

# Install specific skill (start with skill-creator)
claude plugin install skill-creator@daymade-skills

# Test by copying to user skills directory
cp -r skill-name ~/.claude/skills/
# Then restart Claude Code
```

In Claude Code, use `/plugin ...` slash commands. In your terminal, use `claude plugin ...`.

### Git Operations

This repository uses standard git workflow, but **always stage files by name**,
never `git add -A` / `git add .`. Multiple agents may have unstaged changes in
the same worktree — a blanket stage piggybacks their work into your commit:

```bash
git status
git add path/to/file1 path/to/file2   # specific files only
git commit -m "message"
git push
```

## Skill Writing Requirements

### Writing Style

Use **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions) throughout all skill content:
- ✅ "Extract files from a repomix file using the bundled script"
- ❌ "You should extract files from a repomix file"

### YAML Frontmatter Requirements

Every SKILL.md must include:
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Clear description with activation triggers. This skill should be used when...
---
```

### Privacy and Path Guidelines (Enforced by Pre-commit Hook)

Skills for public distribution must NOT contain:
- Absolute paths to user directories (`/home/username/`, `/Users/username/`)
- Personal usernames, company names, product names
- Phone numbers, personal email addresses
- OneDrive paths or environment-specific absolute paths
- Use relative paths within skill bundle or standard placeholders (`<workspace>/`, `<user_id>`)

**Four-layer defense system:**
1. **CLAUDE.md rules** (this section) — Claude avoids generating sensitive content
2. **Global PII Guard pre-commit hook** (`~/scripts/git-pii-guard/pre-commit`) — blocks staged PII/secrets and generated/local artifact paths
3. **Global PII Guard pre-push hook** (`~/scripts/git-pii-guard/pre-push`) — scans commits about to be pushed, catching bad local history before it hits GitHub
4. **gitleaks** (`.gitleaks.toml`) — deep scan with custom rules for this repo

PII Guard is enabled via `~/scripts/git-pii-guard/manage.sh enable <repo-path>`, which sets `core.hooksPath` to `~/scripts/git-pii-guard`.
For repo-specific additions:
- `.pii-patterns` — extra content regexes
- `.pii-path-patterns` — extra forbidden path regexes
- `.pii-allowpaths` — explicit path allowlist exceptions
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` — optional repo-local runner that wires `pre-commit` framework to the same path/content rules for contributors who prefer managed hooks
If it fires, fix the issue — do NOT use `--no-verify` to bypass.

### Content Organization

- Keep SKILL.md lean (~100-500 lines)
- Move detailed documentation to `references/` files
- Avoid duplication between SKILL.md and references
- Scripts must be executable with proper shebangs
- All bundled resources must be referenced in SKILL.md

## Marketplace Configuration

The marketplace is configured in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:
- Contains 52 plugin entries: most map to one skill, while suite plugins (`daymade-docs`, `daymade-claude-code`) map to multiple related skills
- Each plugin has: name, description, version, category, keywords, skills array
- Marketplace metadata: name, owner, version, homepage
- Suite plugins use `suites/<suite-name>/` as the canonical source for their member skills so suite caches contain only those skills. Single-skill plugin entries for suite members should point to the same canonical subdirectories.

### Versioning Architecture

**Two separate version tracking systems:**

1. **Marketplace Version** (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` → `metadata.version`)
   - Tracks the marketplace catalog as a whole
   - Current: v1.45.1
   - Bump when: Adding/removing skills, adding/removing suite plugins, major marketplace restructuring
   - Semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

2. **Individual Skill Versions** (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` → `plugins[].version`)
   - Each skill has its own independent version
   - Example: ppt-creator v1.0.0, skill-creator v1.4.0
   - Bump when: Updating that specific skill
   - **CRITICAL**: Skills should NOT have version sections in SKILL.md

**Key Principle**: SKILL.md files should be timeless content focused on functionality. Versions are tracked in marketplace.json only.

### ⚠️ Updating Existing Skills (MANDATORY)

**Any commit that modifies a skill's files MUST bump that skill's version in `marketplace.json`.**

This applies when you change ANY file under a skill directory:
- `SKILL.md` (instructions, description, workflow)
- `references/` (documentation, principles, examples)
- `scripts/` (executable code)
- `assets/` (templates, resources)

**Version bump rules:**
- Content/doc updates (new sections, rewritten principles) → bump **MINOR** (1.0.1 → 1.1.0)
- Bug fixes, typo fixes → bump **PATCH** (1.0.1 → 1.0.2)
- Breaking changes (renamed commands, removed features) → bump **MAJOR** (1.0.1 → 2.0.0)

**Pre-commit check:** Before committing, run `git diff --name-only` and verify: for every `skill-name/` directory that appears, `marketplace.json` also has a version bump for that skill's `plugins[].version`.

## YouTube Downloader SOP (Internal)

See [youtube-downloader/references/internal-sop.md](./youtube-downloader/references/internal-sop.md) for yt-dlp troubleshooting steps (PO tokens, proxy, cookies, etc.).

## Python Development

All Python scripts in this repository:
- Use Python 3.6+ syntax
- Include shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Are executable (chmod +x)
- Have no external dependencies or document them clearly
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines

## Quality Standards

Before submitting or modifying skills:
- Valid YAML frontmatter with required fields
- Description includes clear activation triggers
- All referenced files exist
- Scripts are executable and tested
- No absolute paths or user-specific information
- Comprehensive documentation
- No TODOs or placeholders

## Skill Creation Workflow

When creating a new skill:
1. Understand concrete usage examples
2. Plan reusable contents (scripts/references/assets)
3. Initialize using `init_skill.py`
4. Edit SKILL.md and bundled resources
5. Package using `package_skill.py` (auto-validates)
6. Iterate based on testing feedback

## Adding a New Skill to Marketplace

For the full step-by-step guide with templates and examples, see [references/new-skill-guide.md](./references/new-skill-guide.md).

**Files to update** (all required):

| File | Locations to update |
|------|-------------------|
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | metadata.version + metadata.description + new plugin entry |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | New version entry |
| `README.md` | 7 locations: badges, description, install cmd, skill section, use case, docs link, requirements |
| `README.zh-CN.md` | 7 locations: same as above, translated |
| `CLAUDE.md` | 3 locations: overview count, marketplace config count, Available Skills list |
| `skill-name/` | The actual skill directory + packaged .zip |

**Quick workflow**:
```bash
# 1. Validate & package the skill itself
cd skill-creator
uv run python -m scripts.security_scan ../skill-name --verbose
uv run --with PyYAML python -m scripts.package_skill ../skill-name

# 2. Update all files listed above (see references/new-skill-guide.md for the
#    detailed step-by-step, including 7 README locations and 3 CLAUDE.md spots)

# 3. One-shot marketplace validation (ships with marketplace-dev skill)
cd .. && bash suites/daymade-claude-code/marketplace-dev/scripts/check_marketplace.sh
# Runs: JSON syntax → claude plugin validate → source+skills resolution →
# reverse sync (warns when a disk SKILL.md is not registered). A WARN on
# reverse sync is the canary for orphan skills — register them or delete them.

# 4. Stage specific files by name, never `git add -A` or `git add .`
#    (a parallel agent once piggybacked another session's unstaged changes
#    into its commit via `git add -A`; the fix is to stage explicitly)
git add .claude-plugin/marketplace.json CHANGELOG.md README.md README.zh-CN.md \
        CLAUDE.md skill-name/
git commit -m "Release vX.Y.0: Add skill-name"
git push

# 5. Release
gh release create vX.Y.0 --title "Release vX.Y.0: Add skill-name" --notes "..."
```

**Top mistakes**: Forgetting to push to GitHub, forgetting README.zh-CN.md, inconsistent version numbers across files, leaving an orphan SKILL.md on disk unregistered (caught by `check_marketplace.sh` reverse sync), using `git add -A` in a repo where multiple agents may have unstaged changes.
