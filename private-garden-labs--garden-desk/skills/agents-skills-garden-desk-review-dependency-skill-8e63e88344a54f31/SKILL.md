# Review A Garden Desk Dependency

1. Define the exact capability needed and the owner request that needs it.
2. Search the repository and the standard library for an existing solution.
3. Use primary sources: official documentation, registry metadata, source, releases, advisories, license files.
4. Evaluate maintenance, license and redistribution, transitive dependencies, offline behavior, telemetry, network and credential access, footprint, native code, platforms, security posture, and adapter fit.
5. Mark untested platform, performance, or packaging claims as research-derived.

Produce:

```markdown
## Dependency Review

- Capability and request:
- Existing alternative:
- Candidate and pinned version:
- License and redistribution:
- Offline, telemetry, network, and credential behavior:
- Footprint, native code, and platforms:
- Security and maintenance:
- Adapter fit:
- Decision: adopt | benchmark | defer | reject
```

Do not install the candidate unless implementation was requested.
