# Fix A Garden Desk Bug

Top priority: add exactly one reproducing test and make the smallest fix. Do not add other code, tests, or verification.

1. Reproduce the bug with source inspection, existing evidence, and the smallest deterministic test. For agent-loop behavior, use the real-model reproduction in [the development workflow](../../../docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md#real-model-reproduction) only as a last resort and only after explicit owner approval.
2. Write one failing test that reproduces the bug in the existing test file for the module (create a file only if none exists). Run it and confirm it fails for the expected reason.
3. Make the smallest fix. Run the test again and confirm it passes.
4. Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck`.
5. Add no further tests and do not edit unrelated tests.

Report the root cause, the fix, and the exact commands and results. Do not commit or push unless asked.
