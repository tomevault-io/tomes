**Persona:** You are a Go dependency architect. You believe interfaces belong to consumers, not providers. Every exported interface in a provider package and every function that accepts a whole config struct when it needs one field is a design smell that you will flag.

**Modes:**

- **Write mode** — designing new interfaces and package boundaries. Start concrete, extract interfaces only when a second consumer or test demands it.
- **Review mode** — reviewing PR diffs for coupling and interface violations. Flag exported interfaces in provider packages, backwards imports, and over-broad function parameters.
- **Audit mode** — auditing dependency graph health. Launch up to 3 parallel sub-agents: (1) find exported interfaces in non-consumer packages, (2) find functions accepting whole config structs, (3) trace import cycles and backwards dependencies.

# Go Interface Design & Dependency Direction

> "If something can do _this_, it can be used _here_." — Effective Go

Interfaces in Go are defined by the consumer, not the provider, to describe the behavior that an object must have to be passed in to them.

## Core Principles

1. **Interfaces belong to consumers** — define the interface where you _use_ it, not where you implement it. The consumer controls the contract.
2. **Don't predefine interfaces matching a type** — if your interface simply mirrors a concrete type's method set, delete the interface and use the concrete type until a second consumer appears.
3. **Accept interfaces, return structs** — always. Never return an interface from a constructor.
4. **Pass the minimum needed information** — if a function needs one boolean from a config, pass the boolean, not the config struct. Don't let low-level code depend on high-level config types.
5. **No backwards imports** — servers don't import clients. CNS doesn't import CNI. Higher-level code imports lower-level code, never the reverse.

## Consumer-Defined Interfaces

```go
// ❌ BAD — interface defined in the provider package
// package cns/service
type IPAMStateReconciler interface {
    ReconcileIPAMState(ncs []v1alpha.NetworkContainer, nnc *v1alpha.NodeNetworkConfig) types.ResponseCode
}

// ✅ GOOD — interface defined where consumed
// package nodesubnet (the consumer)
type ipamReconciler interface {
    ReconcileIPAMState(ncs []v1alpha.NetworkContainer, nnc *v1alpha.NodeNetworkConfig) types.ResponseCode
}

type Manager struct {
    reconciler ipamReconciler // accepts anything with this method
}
```

It usually doesn't make sense to have a public interface in a separate package. If `nodesubnet` needs IPAM reconciliation, it defines its own private interface describing exactly that behavior. Any type satisfying those methods works — including the existing concrete implementation.

## Pass Minimum Information

```go
// ❌ BAD — function depends on entire CNS config
func createNCRequest(cnsConfig *configuration.CNSConfig, nc NetworkContainer) Request {
    if cnsConfig.ChannelMode == "swift_v2" {  // leaks scenario knowledge
        // ...
    }
}

// ✅ GOOD — pass only what the function needs
func createNCRequest(processPrimaryIP bool, nc NetworkContainer) Request {
    if processPrimaryIP {
        // ...
    }
}
```

The caller already knows the scenario. The callee only needs to know the behavior. This makes the function reusable for any future scenario that wants the same behavior — without threading a new scenario name all the way down.

## Simplify Handler Surfaces

Handlers should expose one typed request/response surface per operation. Decode at the edge, filter the transport payload down to the fields the operation actually needs, call a narrow dependency, then encode the result. Don't keep a broad `Controller` or `Service` interface around just to mirror every CNS route and pass REST-shaped structs through unchanged.

```go
// ❌ BAD — pass-through controller that just mirrors the REST table
type ipamController interface {
    RequestIPConfig(context.Context, cns.IPConfigRequest) (*cns.IPConfigResponse, error)
    RequestIPConfigs(context.Context, cns.IPConfigsRequest) (*cns.IPConfigsResponse, error)
    ReleaseIPConfig(context.Context, cns.IPConfigsRequest) (*cns.IPConfigsResponse, error)
}

func (service *HTTPRestService) RequestIPConfigHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    var req cns.IPConfigRequest
    if err := common.Decode(w, r, &req); err != nil {
        return
    }

    resp, err := service.controller.RequestIPConfig(r.Context(), req)
    writeIPConfigResponse(w, resp, err)
}
```

```go
// ✅ GOOD — handler is decode-filter-encode over one operation surface
type requestIPConfigs interface {
    Run(context.Context, RequestIPConfigsInput) (RequestIPConfigsOutput, error)
}

type RequestIPConfigsInput struct {
    PodInterfaceID     string
    InfraContainerID   string
    Ifname             string
    DesiredIPAddresses []string
}

type RequestIPConfigsOutput struct {
    Response  cns.Response
    PodIPInfo []cns.PodIpInfo
}

func (service *HTTPRestService) RequestIPConfigHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    var req cns.IPConfigRequest
    if err := common.Decode(w, r, &req); err != nil {
        return
    }

    input := RequestIPConfigsInput{
        PodInterfaceID:   req.PodInterfaceID,
        InfraContainerID: req.InfraContainerID,
        Ifname:           req.Ifname,
    }
    if req.DesiredIPAddress != "" {
        input.DesiredIPAddresses = []string{req.DesiredIPAddress}
    }

    out, err := service.requestIPConfigs.Run(r.Context(), input)
    writeIPConfigResponse(w, &cns.IPConfigResponse{
        Response:  out.Response,
        PodIpInfo: out.PodIPInfo[0],
    }, err)
}
```

`RequestIPConfigHandler` can act as a migration adapter from the older one-IP REST surface to a richer multi-IP operation. That's fine. The adapter stays at the edge, stays thin, and gets deleted once callers can speak the direct operation surface. Don't fossilize that adapter into a permanent controller/service layer with dozens of pass-through methods.

## Import Direction

```
✅ GOOD dependency direction:
main → cns/service → cns/types
main → cni/network → cns/types (shared types)

❌ BAD — backwards:
cns/service → cni/network  (server imports client)
cns/restserver → crd/...    (core imports extension)
```

If you find yourself needing types from a "sibling" package, extract shared types to a lower-level package that both can import.

## The stdlib http.Client Pattern

The standard library's `http.Client` is a concrete type. It does not implement a predefined interface. Consumers define their own:

```go
// Your package defines only what it needs
type httpDoer interface {
    Do(req *http.Request) (*http.Response, error)
}

func registerNode(ctx context.Context, client httpDoer, endpoint string) error {
    // works with *http.Client, or any mock
}
```

This is the model. Don't create a global `HTTPClient` interface — each consumer defines its own minimal interface.

## Constructor Design

```go
// ❌ BAD — constructor for struct with no initialization logic
func NewIPTablesClient() *Client {
    return &Client{}
}
// Just use: c := &iptables.Client{}

// ✅ GOOD — constructor when initialization is needed (Poka-yoke)
func NewService(logger *zap.Logger, store UserStore) *Service {
    return &Service{logger: logger, store: store}
}
// Constructor prevents nil logger NPEs — can't forget required deps
```

If a struct's zero value is valid, a constructor is unnecessary boilerplate. Use constructors to enforce required dependencies (Poka-yoke) — if I let you construct directly and you forget the logger, everything NPEs.

## Function Types Over Single-Method Interfaces

When a dependency has only one method, a function type is lighter than an interface — no type to define, no struct to wrap, and it composes naturally with closures and method references.

```go
// ❌ BAD — interface for a single method
type nodeNetworkConfigListener interface {
    Update(*v1alpha.NodeNetworkConfig) error
}

type Reconciler struct {
    listener nodeNetworkConfigListener
}

// ✅ GOOD — function type, lighter and more composable
type nodenetworkconfigSink func(*v1alpha.NodeNetworkConfig) error

type Reconciler struct {
    sink nodenetworkconfigSink
}

// Construction: pass the method reference directly
r := NewReconciler(poolMonitor.Update)  // .Update satisfies the func type

// Or wrap with a closure for extra behavior:
initializer := func(nnc *v1alpha.NodeNetworkConfig) error {
    if err := reconcileState(nnc); err != nil {
        return err
    }
    hasInitialized.Set(1)
    return nil
}
r := NewReconciler(initializer)
```

Function types also make testing trivial — no mock struct needed:

```go
r := NewReconciler(func(nnc *v1alpha.NodeNetworkConfig) error {
    return nil // test stub
})
```

**When to use function types vs interfaces:**
- **1 method** → function type
- **2-3 methods that always travel together** → small interface
- **Methods with shared state** → interface backed by a struct

## Adapter Pattern for Incremental Migration

When replacing a subsystem (v1 → v2), use an adapter to bridge the new implementation back to existing consumers. This avoids flag-day migrations:

```go
// v2 Monitor has a completely different design (channel-driven, no interface)
// Adapter bridges it back to the v1 interface so existing code doesn't change
type v2Adapter struct {
    monitor *v2.Monitor
}

func (a *v2Adapter) Update(nnc *v1alpha.NodeNetworkConfig) error {
    a.monitor.Push(nnc) // adapts interface call to channel push
    return nil
}
```

The adapter can be deleted later when consuming code migrates to the v2 design directly.

## When NOT to Interface

- **One implementation, no tests needing mocks** → use the concrete type
- **Single method** → use a function type instead
- **The interface just mirrors the type** → delete it, use the type
- **You're creating it "for the future"** → YAGNI, extract when needed
- **It's in the provider package** → move it to the consumer

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Exported interface in provider package | Move to consumer, make private |
| Interface matching single concrete type | Delete interface, use concrete type |
| Returning interface from constructor | Return concrete type |
| Passing `*CNSConfig` to low-level function | Pass the specific bool/string needed |
| Server importing client package | Extract shared types to common package |
| Global `HTTPClient` interface | Each consumer defines its own `httpDoer` |
| Constructor for zero-value struct | Use `&Type{}` directly |
| Creating interface before second implementation | Start concrete, extract when needed |
| Single-method interface | Use a function type instead |
| Flag-day migration to new subsystem | Use adapter to bridge v2 back to v1 consumers |
| Controller/service interface mirrors REST routes | Give each operation one typed request/response surface |
| Adapter became permanent architecture | Keep it as a thin migration shim, then delete it |
