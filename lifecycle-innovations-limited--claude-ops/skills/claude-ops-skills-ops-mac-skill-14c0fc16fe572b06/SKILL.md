# OPS ► MAC — macOS Diagnose & Fix

Load `ops-rules` before acting. Public repo (no personal data). Outbound: one draft → one approval → one send. If `AskUserQuestion` / `Workflow` are missing, follow Rule 10 in `ops-rules` (Hermes: numbered options / two-turn Telegram card; `delegate_task`).

One command for native macOS health: it bundles the [`macos-toolkit`](https://github.com/lu-zhengda/macos-toolkit) CLI suite, **auto-installs it on first use**, runs a read-only baseline, and remediates the common offenders behind explicit confirmations.

All work routes through `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-mac`, the single source of truth for install + probes + the aggregate audit. The bundled CLIs:

| Tool | Domain | ops-mac subcommand |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `machealth` | composite health (CPU/mem/disk/thermal/battery/iCloud/TM/net) | `health` |
| `netwhiz` | network + WiFi diagnostics | `net` / `net wifi` |
| `macbroom` | disk cleanup & reclaimable cache scan | `disk` |
| `pstop` | process monitoring (CPU/mem hogs) | `procs` |
| `macdog` | security & privacy audit | `security` |
| `lanchr` | launchd agent/daemon health (`doctor`) | `launchd` |
| `macctl` | power / display / audio control | `power` |
| `macfig` | hidden macOS defaults | `defaults` |
| `updater` | app update management | `update` |

## Platform guard

This skill is **macOS only**. The dispatcher exits with code 3 on non-Darwin. For Linux/WSL/Windows system optimization use `/ops:speedup` (cross-platform). The two are complementary — `/ops:mac` is the deep macOS-native surface; `/ops:speedup` is the portable cleaner.

## Two hard-won quirks (baked into the dispatcher)

1. **`machealth check`/`diagnose` can hang forever** on a stuck Time Machine / iCloud probe (its checks run in parallel with no per-probe skip flag). Every machealth call is wrapped in a hard `timeout` (default 25s, override `OPS_MAC_MACHEALTH_TIMEOUT`). If it trips, the other probes are still reliable — never block on it.
2. **The toolkit's pretty TUI tables render EMPTY when stdout isn't a TTY.** The dispatcher forces `--json` for headless/agent consumers (`macbroom`, `pstop`, `macdog`, `lanchr`). When you need machine data, always pass `--json`.

## Runtime Context

Before anything, ensure the suite is installed (idempotent — no-op if already present):

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-mac ensure
```

## Mode routing

Dispatch on `$ARGUMENTS`:

- empty / `audit` → **Baseline flow** (read-only, below)
- `health` / `net` / `disk` / `procs` / `security` / `launchd` / `power` / `update` → run that single probe and print verbatim:
  ```bash
  ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-mac <subcommand>
  ```
- `fix` → **Remediation flow** (below, Rule 5 confirmations)
- `ensure` / `install` → run `ops-mac ensure` and report what was added

## Baseline flow (`/ops:mac` or `/ops:mac audit`)

Run the aggregate audit — it composes the reliable probes in one call:

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-mac audit
```

Then summarize for the user with a verdict per area:

```
OPS ► MAC AUDIT — [version] ([arch])

🔴/🟡/🟢 Security    grade [X]/100 — [firewall/SIP/FileVault/Gatekeeper/remote-login]
🔴/🟡/🟢 Launchd     [N] genuinely-broken user daemons (Apple -9/SIGKILL noise filtered out)
🟢 Processes  top hog: [name] [N]% CPU
🟢 Network    [iface] [ip] — [ok/degraded]
🟢 Disk       ~[N] GB safe reclaimable (biggest: [cache] [N] GB)
⚠ Health     [machealth result, or "probe timed out — TM/iCloud stuck"]

Next: /ops:mac fix to remediate, or pick one area.
```

**Launchd noise filter** — `lanchr doctor` flags ~50+ "critical" entries; most are normal:
- Apple on-demand agents exit `-9` (SIGKILL) when idle — **expected, not broken**.
- Stale Apple plist paths (cvmsCompAgent, BluetoothUIService, battery helper) — **cosmetic**.
- The **actionable** ones are user/3rd-party daemons with `exit status: 1` or a missing binary you own. Surface only those.

## Remediation flow (`/ops:mac fix`)

Run the audit first to know what's wrong, then offer fixes. **Per plugin Rule 5, every mutating action needs its own confirmation** — never batch-execute. Present via `AskUserQuestion`, max 4 options each.

Common offenders and their guarded fixes:

### 1. Firewall — opt-in only, never offered

The application firewall is **out of scope for `/ops:mac fix`**. Report its state in the audit
and stop there. Do not offer to enable it, do not add it to a fix menu, and do not list it as a
recommendation — a firewall that comes on unasked breaks local listeners (dev servers, MCP
proxies, VNC, tunnels) that the user did not connect the change to.

Touch it only when the user asks for the firewall by name in that turn ("turn the firewall on",
"enable stealth mode"). Then confirm the single action and run:

```bash
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setglobalstate on
# stealth (optional): sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setstealthmode on
```

"Run `/ops:mac fix`" is not that request.

### 2. Stale / crashing launchd user daemons
For each actionable entry from `lanchr doctor` (missing binary, or repeated `exit 1`), confirm **individually**:
```
com.example.foo — binary missing at [path]. This launchd job is dead.
  [Show the plist first]  [Remove it]  [Disable (keep file)]  [Skip]
```
Use `lanchr` to remediate where possible; otherwise `launchctl bootout`/`disable` after showing the plist. **Never touch a daemon the user relies on** (CLIProxyAPI/haproxy, gbrain push, ops-daemon, cloudflared tunnels, watchdogs) without spelling out exactly what it is — cross-check before recommending removal.

### 3. Reclaimable disk
```
macbroom found ~[N] GB of safe cache. Categories: [list].
  [Clean safe caches]  [Pick categories]  [Review largest first]  [Skip]
```
On confirm (safe categories only):
```bash
macbroom clean --caches            # confirm prompt; or --yolo only after explicit approval
```
Never run `macbroom clean --all --yolo` without per-category approval.

### 4. App updates
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-mac update    # updater check — then confirm before applying
```

After any fix, re-run the relevant probe and show before→after.

## Mobile mode (Rule 7)

If `$SSH_CONNECTION`/`$SSH_CLIENT`/`$SSH_TTY` is set, `$OPS_MOBILE=1`, or `$COLUMNS` < 80: drop the boxes/tables, emit 3–8 plain lines, one fact each. Example:

```
mac audit:
security B/100 — firewall OFF.
launchd: 2 dead user daemons.
disk: 8.6 GB safe to clean.
health: machealth probe stuck (TM/iCloud).
fix? /ops:mac fix
```

## When to use this vs other skills

| Want… | Use |
| --- | --- |
| macOS-native deep diagnose + fix (firewall, launchd, network, security) | `/ops:mac` |
| Cross-platform cleaner (Linux/WSL/Windows too) | `/ops:speedup` |
| Quick "is everything connected?" integration glance | `/ops:status` |
| Full health check + auto-repair of the **ops plugin itself** | `/ops:doctor` |
