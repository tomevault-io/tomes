## Runtime Context

Before YOLO analysis, load:

1. **Preferences**: `cat ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/data/ops-ops-marketplace}/preferences.json` — read `owner`, `timezone`, `yolo_enabled`, all channel configs
2. **Daemon health**: `cat ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR}/daemon-health.json` — all services must be healthy for comprehensive analysis
3. **Secrets**: Resolve ALL keys via env → Doppler → password manager: GITHUB_TOKEN, SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN, LINEAR_API_KEY, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
4. **Ops memories**: Load ALL files from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR}/memories/` — contact profiles, preferences, topics, donts. YOLO agents need maximum context.

# OPS ► YOLO MODE

Load `ops-rules` before acting. Public repo (no personal data). Outbound: one draft → one approval → one send. If `AskUserQuestion` / `Workflow` are missing, follow Rule 10 in `ops-rules` (Hermes: numbered options / two-turn Telegram card; `delegate_task`).

## Agent Teams support

If `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is set, use **Agent Teams** instead of fire-and-forget subagents for the C-suite analysis (Phase 2). This enables:

- Agents can share findings mid-analysis (CEO discovers a revenue blocker → CFO factors it into ROI)
- You can steer agents if early findings change priorities
- Agents coordinate on the consensus recommendation

**Team setup** (only when flag is enabled):

```
TeamCreate("yolo-csuite")
Agent(team_name="yolo-csuite", name="ceo", subagent_type="ops:yolo-ceo", ...)
Agent(team_name="yolo-csuite", name="cto", subagent_type="ops:yolo-cto", ...)
Agent(team_name="yolo-csuite", name="cfo", subagent_type="ops:yolo-cfo", ...)
Agent(team_name="yolo-csuite", name="coo", subagent_type="ops:yolo-coo", ...)
```

After initial analysis, use `SendMessage(to="cto", content="CFO flagged $400/mo in waste — does this change your tech-debt ranking?")` or similar to cross-pollinate findings between peer agents. The **main `/ops:yolo` orchestrator** (this skill) then reads all four analysis files (ceo-analysis.md, cto-analysis.md, cfo-analysis.md, coo-analysis.md) and synthesizes them into the Hard Truths report. `yolo-ceo` is a parallel peer, not the synthesizer.

If the flag is NOT set, fall back to standard parallel subagents (fire-and-forget, no mid-task steering).

## Phase 0 — MANDATORY: Clear cached state, force fresh-state collection

**NEVER reuse a prior YOLO session's reports.** Stale C-suite analyses misinform decisions.
Before pre-gathering anything, run:

```!
# Archive any prior YOLO sessions (don't delete — keep history) then start fresh.
mkdir -p ~/.claude/yolo-archive
for d in /tmp/yolo-*/; do
  [ -d "$d" ] || continue
  ts=$(basename "$d")
  mv "$d" "$HOME/.claude/yolo-archive/${ts}-$(date +%s)" 2>/dev/null || true
done

# Allocate this run's session dir.
SESSION_ID="$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)-$$"
SESSION_DIR="/tmp/yolo-${SESSION_ID}"
mkdir -p "$SESSION_DIR"
echo "$SESSION_DIR" > /tmp/yolo-current-session
echo "YOLO session: $SESSION_DIR (prior reports archived to ~/.claude/yolo-archive/)"

# Drop any cached pre-gather artifacts so Phase 1 hits live sources.
rm -f /tmp/ops-marketing-dash.cache /tmp/ops-external.cache /tmp/ops-infra.cache 2>/dev/null || true
```

Each C-suite agent prompt MUST include this line verbatim:

> "Use ONLY the pre-gathered data block in this prompt. Do NOT read prior /tmp/yolo-\*/ files, do NOT reference cached reports, do NOT cite earlier session findings. This is a fresh-state run; report what is true RIGHT NOW."

## Phase 1 — Pre-gather ALL data (live, never cached)

Run all of these simultaneously:

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-infra 2>/dev/null || echo '{}'
```

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-git 2>/dev/null || echo '[]'
```

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-prs 2>/dev/null || echo '[]'
```

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-ci 2>/dev/null || echo '[]'
```

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-unread 2>/dev/null || echo '{}'
```

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/aws-usage-cost.sh snapshot 2>/dev/null || echo '{}'
```
```!
cat "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/registry.json" 2>/dev/null || echo '{}'
```

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-external 2>/dev/null || echo '[]'
```

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-marketing-dash 2>/dev/null || echo '{}'
```

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-gsd-states 2>/dev/null || true
```

---

> **Competitor state**: Each C-suite agent sources `scripts/lib/competitor/context.sh` and calls `competitor_vertical_slice <role>` internally. The orchestrator does NOT need to pre-fetch competitor data — it is loaded on-demand per agent with role-specific filtering.

## Phase 2 — Spawn 4 C-suite agents in parallel

Spawn these 4 agents simultaneously using all pre-gathered data as context. Each writes their analysis to a file in `/tmp/yolo-[session]/`:

### Agent 1 — CEO (Strategic)

Uses `agents/yolo-ceo.md`. Writes `/tmp/yolo-[session]/ceo-analysis.md`.

- What's the #1 thing blocking growth right now?
- Are we building the right things?
- Where are we wasting time vs. creating value?
- What would you tell an investor today, unfiltered?

### Agent 2 — CTO (Technical)

Uses `agents/yolo-cto.md`. Writes `/tmp/yolo-[session]/cto-analysis.md`.

- What's the worst technical debt that will bite us?
- Which services are time-bombs?
- Is the team/architecture set up to scale?
- What corners were cut that need fixing now?

### Agent 3 — CFO (Financial)

Uses `agents/yolo-cfo.md`. Writes `/tmp/yolo-[session]/cfo-analysis.md`.

- Actual burn rate vs. runway
- Which AWS services are waste?
- When do we hit zero if nothing changes?
- What's the ROI on current work?
- If `home_automation` is configured in `$PREFS_PATH`, check energy spend trend via `/ops:ops-home status` — is the kWh/day curve trending up materially? Flag anomalous draw.

### Agent 4 — COO (Operations)

Uses `agents/yolo-coo.md`. Writes `/tmp/yolo-[session]/coo-analysis.md`.

- What's falling through the cracks right now?
- Which processes are broken?
- What's the top execution risk this week?
- What should be automated that isn't?
- If `home_automation` is configured in `$PREFS_PATH`, include home-automation health in operations checks via `/ops:ops-home status`: are smoke/water alarms armed? Energy anomalies? Devices offline? Flow failures?

## Phase 3 — Hard Truths Report (orchestrator synthesis)

**This skill (the main orchestrator) is the synthesizer** — NOT `yolo-ceo`. After all 4 parallel agents complete and have written their analysis files to `/tmp/yolo-[session]/{ceo,cto,cfo,coo}-analysis.md`, read all four files here in the main context and synthesize them into a unified report.

### Phase 3a — Consolidated master executive report (MANDATORY)

**Every YOLO run MUST produce one consolidated master executive report — no exceptions.** This is the canonical output of the analysis; the four per-officer files are supporting detail. Do this BEFORE rendering the on-screen Hard Truths block:

1. Read all four `/tmp/yolo-[session]/{ceo,cto,cfo,coo}-analysis.md` files in the main context.
2. Synthesize them into a single `executive-summary.md` and write it to **`/tmp/yolo-[session]/executive-summary.md`**. Never skip this write, even if one officer file is missing — note any missing officer inline and consolidate the rest.
3. The master report MUST contain, in this order:
   - **Title + timestamp** — `YOLO Executive Summary — [date]`.
   - **TL;DR** — 2–3 sentences a busy founder can read in 10 seconds.
   - **Consensus #1 action** — the single most important thing today, with the officers who back it.
   - **Per-officer hard truths** — the 1–2 sharpest truths from each of CEO / CTO / CFO / COO, summarized (not pasted verbatim).
   - **Cross-cutting themes** — issues ≥2 officers raised independently (these are the highest-signal items).
   - **Prioritized action list** — ranked, each tagged `[auto]` (YOLO can do it) or `⚠️ REQUIRES CONFIRMATION` (needs human sign-off), with the source officer(s).
   - **What's healthy** — 1–2 lines so the report isn't all alarm.
   - **Source files** — relative links to the four officer files.
4. The on-screen Hard Truths block below is the SHORT view of this same report — keep the two consistent (same consensus, same #1 action).

Render the on-screen report:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 YOLO ► HARD TRUTHS REPORT — [date]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

 CEO: [1-2 brutal strategic truths]

 CTO: [1-2 brutal technical truths]

 CFO: [1-2 brutal financial truths]

 COO: [1-2 brutal operational truths]

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 CONSENSUS: The #1 thing that matters today is:
 [single most important action, no sugar-coating]
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

 Master executive report (consolidated):
 /tmp/yolo-[session]/executive-summary.md

 Supporting per-officer analyses:
 /tmp/yolo-[session]/ceo-analysis.md
 /tmp/yolo-[session]/cto-analysis.md
 /tmp/yolo-[session]/cfo-analysis.md
 /tmp/yolo-[session]/coo-analysis.md

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 Type YOLO to hand over the controls.
 I'll run your business autonomously for the next day.
 This means: closing inbox, merging ready PRs,
 fixing fires, advancing GSD phases, triaging issues.

 Or pick an analysis to read:
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Use **batched AskUserQuestion calls** (max 4 options each):

AskUserQuestion call 1:

```
  [Read master executive report]
  [Read a single officer analysis]
  [Execute top recommendation now]
  [More...]
```

AskUserQuestion call 2 (only if "More..."):

```
  [Type YOLO to go autonomous]
  [Stop here]
```

If the user picks "Read a single officer analysis", present the four officer files (CEO / CTO / CFO / COO) in a follow-up call. The master executive report is the default/recommended read — it already consolidates all four.

---

## Phase 4 — YOLO Autonomous Mode

If user types `YOLO` (all caps), enter autonomous mode via `/loop`.

**Before starting**, use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm scope:

```
YOLO mode will autonomously execute these steps:
  1. Inbox — reply to humans, archive automated
  2. Fires — fix CRITICAL/HIGH production issues
  3. PRs — merge ready PRs (CI green, approved)
  4. Triage — auto-resolve confirmed-fixed issues
  5. GSD — advance highest-priority phase
  6. Linear — sync sprint board
  7. Deploy — trigger pending deploys
  8. Report — summary

  [Run all 8 steps]  [Pick which steps to run]  [Cancel]
```

If user picks "Pick which steps", show steps as `multiSelect` via **batched AskUserQuestion calls** (max 4 options each):

Call 1: `[Inbox]`, `[Fires]`, `[PRs]`, `[More steps...]`
Call 2 (if "More steps..."): `[Triage]`, `[GSD]`, `[Linear]`, `[More steps...]`
Call 3 (if "More steps..."): `[Deploy]`, `[Report]`, `[Done selecting]`

Run the selected steps in sequence, reporting after each step.

**Per-step confirmations** (use `AskUserQuestion` before EACH destructive action):

- **Inbox**: Show drafted replies and ask `[Send all N replies]` / `[Review each one]` / `[Skip inbox]` before sending any messages
- **Fires**: Show proposed fix and ask `[Dispatch fix agent]` / `[Skip]` before each agent dispatch
- **PRs**: Show PR list and ask `[Merge all N ready PRs]` / `[Pick which ones]` / `[Skip]` before merging
- **Triage**: Show issues to close and ask `[Auto-resolve all N confirmed-fixed]` / `[Review each]` / `[Skip]` before closing
- **Deploy**: Show pending deploys and ask `[Deploy all]` / `[Pick which]` / `[Skip]` before triggering
- **Infrastructure changes**: For EVERY destructive infra action (delete ALB, stop RDS, disable Multi-AZ, purge images, etc.), present the specific action with context from the C-suite reports and ask `[Execute]` / `[Skip]` individually. NEVER batch destructive infra actions.

**Report-driven execution**: When the user approves executing recommendations from the Hard Truths report:

1. Read ALL C-suite analysis files (`/tmp/yolo-[session]/*.md`)
2. Extract specific actionable items marked with `⚠️ REQUIRES CONFIRMATION`
3. Present each action individually via `AskUserQuestion` with the exact command that will run, the expected outcome, and the source report (CTO/CFO/COO)
4. Only execute after explicit per-action approval
5. After each action, verify the result and report back before proceeding to the next

After each step, check if new fires have appeared before proceeding.
Report final summary when done.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is `analyze` or empty, go straight to Phase 1.
If `$ARGUMENTS` is `YOLO`, skip to Phase 4.
If `$ARGUMENTS` is `report`, skip to Phase 3 — read the existing `/tmp/yolo-[session]/executive-summary.md` master report if present (fall back to re-consolidating from the four officer files), and re-render the on-screen Hard Truths block from it.

## Native tool usage

### Tasks — progress tracking

Use `TaskCreate` at the start of Phase 4 to create a task for each YOLO step. Update with `TaskUpdate` as each completes. This gives the user a live progress view across the autonomous run.

### PlanMode — review before autonomous

Before Phase 4 execution, use `EnterPlanMode` to present the full execution plan. The user reviews what YOLO will do, approves or modifies, then `ExitPlanMode` to begin execution.

### Cron — schedule daily YOLO

After Phase 4 completes, offer to schedule recurring YOLO via `AskUserQuestion`:

```
  [Schedule daily YOLO at 9am]  [Schedule weekly Monday briefing]  [No schedule]
```

Use `CronCreate` if selected. Use `CronList`/`CronDelete` to manage existing schedules.

### Monitor — live CI/deploy watching

When YOLO dispatches fix agents or triggers deploys, use `Monitor` to stream CI output in real-time instead of polling with sleep loops.

### WebFetch/WebSearch — enrichment

Use `WebFetch` to pull Grafana dashboards, Sentry event details, or AWS status pages when MCPs are unavailable. Use `WebSearch` to find context on production errors (e.g., known AWS outages).

---

## Ledger Integration

**CLAIM_KEY:** `yolo:session` — one active YOLO session at a time (stable key for concurrency).

Individual actions within the session (merges, fixes, deploys) each write their own
typed claim via the relevant skill's ledger pattern (see `ops-merge`, `ops-fires`,
`ops-deploy`). The session-level key tracks the overall autonomous run.

### Pre-flight skip-check

```bash
SESSION_TS=$(date +%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M)
CLAIM_KEY="yolo:session"
ledger query --claim-key "$CLAIM_KEY" --since=-PT4H
```

If another YOLO session is `in_progress`, surface it before starting a new one —
two autonomous sessions running concurrently will conflict on shared resources.

### Claim + resolve

```bash
# Claim at YOLO session start
ledger write \
  --claim-key "$CLAIM_KEY" \
  --kind "file" \
  --status "in_progress" \
  --title "YOLO session ${SESSION_TS}" \
  --ttl-sec 14400

# Resolve at session end with summary
ledger write \
  --claim-key "$CLAIM_KEY" \
  --kind "file" \
  --status "done" \
  --title "YOLO session ${SESSION_TS}" \
  --context "N fires fixed, N PRs merged, N deploys triggered"
```
