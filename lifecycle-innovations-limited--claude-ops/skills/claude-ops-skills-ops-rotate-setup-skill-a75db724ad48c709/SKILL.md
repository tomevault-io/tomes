# Claude enrollment handoff

Load `ops-rules` before acting. Public repo (no personal data). Outbound: one draft → one approval → one send. If `AskUserQuestion` / `Workflow` are missing, follow Rule 10 in `ops-rules` (Hermes: numbered options / two-turn Telegram card; `delegate_task`).

Direct Claude browser, OAuth, magic-link, setup, and unattended authentication
are disabled. Do not launch a browser, poll email, invoke `rotate.mjs --setup`,
invoke `rotate-magic.mjs`, modify auth inventory, or suggest an environment
bypass.

Tell the operator to use `scripts/account-rotation/staged-enrollment.mjs` with:

1. An owner-only deployment config that pins every trust root and the canonical
   operation lock.
2. A short-lived, separately signed `stage` approval for an externally captured
   CLIProxyAPI Claude auth candidate.
3. External containment of all writers.
4. A distinct `activate` approval bound to the staged digest and attesting
   `writersQuiesced: true`.

The attestation records operator confirmation; it does not stop services or
contain writers itself. This skill does not sign approvals or perform either
operation on the operator's behalf.
