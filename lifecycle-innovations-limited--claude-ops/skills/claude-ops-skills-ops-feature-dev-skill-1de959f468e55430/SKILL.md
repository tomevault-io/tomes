## Agent Teams support

If `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is set, use **Agent Teams** when
feature-dev phases fan out in parallel (e.g. explore + architect, or implement +
review). This enables:

- Phase agents share findings mid-flight (explore surfaces a constraint → architect
  adjusts before implementation starts)
- You can steer priorities in real time ("finish API contract first, then UI")
- Agents report progress as each phase completes

**Team setup** (only when the flag is enabled, and only for genuinely parallel phases):

```bash
TeamCreate("feature-dev-lifecycle")
Agent(team_name="feature-dev-lifecycle", name="phase-explore", ...)
Agent(team_name="feature-dev-lifecycle", name="phase-architect", ...)
```

Steer with `SendMessage` / `broadcast`; share work via `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`.

If the flag is NOT set, fall back to standard fire-and-forget subagents (the
default), or invoke `/feature-dev` inline via the Skill tool.

# OPS ► FEATURE DEV

Load `ops-rules` before acting. Public repo (no personal data). Outbound: one draft → one approval → one send. If `AskUserQuestion` / `Workflow` are missing, follow Rule 10 in `ops-rules` (Hermes: numbered options / two-turn Telegram card; `delegate_task`).

Thin router into the **feature-dev** companion plugin. Do not re-implement its phases here.

## When to use

- **Ad-hoc repos** (no `.planning/`): optional structured alternative to jumping straight into `/flow build`.
- **Project repos** (`.planning/` present): run **before** `gsd-execute-phase` when you want exploration + architecture + clarifying questions; execution still canonical via GSD.
- **Review**: gstack `/review` and `gsd-code-review` stay canonical; feature-dev Phase 6 is available via explicit `/feature-dev` or auto-swap to `feature-dev:code-reviewer`.

## Routing

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, invoke `/feature-dev` with no args (discovery phase).

Otherwise invoke `/feature-dev $ARGUMENTS` via the **Skill** tool.

## Integration notes

- Requires the **feature-dev** plugin installed (`/ops:setup` Step 2c or `/plugin install feature-dev`).
- Specialist auto-swap (`feature-dev:code-*`) is handled by `bin/ops-suggest-specialized-agent` when the plugin is present.
- Does **not** replace `/flow build`, `/review`, or `gsd-execute-phase` — it overlays them.
