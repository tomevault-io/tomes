## Agent Teams support

If `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is set, use **Agent Teams** when a
lifecycle stage fans out into parallel, coordinated work (e.g. build + test +
review running together, or a multi-repo ship). This enables:

- Stage agents share context mid-flight (the test agent surfaces a regression →
  the build agent pivots before review starts)
- You can steer priorities in real time ("land the API change first, then docs")
- Agents report progress as each stage completes, so you sequence the merge

**Team setup** (only when the flag is enabled, and only for genuinely parallel stages):

```
TeamCreate("flow-lifecycle")
Agent(team_name="flow-lifecycle", name="stage-build", ...)
Agent(team_name="flow-lifecycle", name="stage-test", ...)
```

Steer with `SendMessage` / `broadcast`; share work via `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`.

If the flag is NOT set, fall back to standard fire-and-forget subagents (the
default), or just route the stage to its single canonical command inline.

## Runtime Context

Before routing, compute where the user is on the lifecycle:

```bash
# FLOW_TARGET: the project you are actually working on. Default to the shell's
# cwd, but pass an explicit path when the harness's tool cwd is not the project
# (see the mode-resolution note below).
FLOW_TARGET="${FLOW_TARGET:-$PWD}"
FLOW_STATE=""
for _d in "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-}" \
          "$HOME/Developer/repos/claude-ops/claude-ops" \
          "$HOME/external-skills/claude-ops" \
          "$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/ops-marketplace/claude-ops" \
          "$HOME/Projects/claude-ops/claude-ops"; do
  [ -n "$_d" ] && [ -x "$_d/bin/flow-state" ] && { FLOW_STATE="$_d/bin/flow-state"; break; }
done
[ -n "$FLOW_STATE" ] || { echo "flow: no executable bin/flow-state found" >&2; exit 1; }
"$FLOW_STATE" "$FLOW_TARGET"
```

Both failures are **fail-closed on purpose**. If no helper resolves, or the
target path is not a directory, stop and say so — do not route. `MODE` is what
decides GSD vs gstack, so routing without it silently picks the wrong half of
the lifecycle, which is worse than an error.

Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-}`, not `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`: the bare form aborts
under `set -u`, and an unguarded `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/flow-state` expands
to the absolute path `/bin/flow-state` when the variable is unset.

**Always pass the target path explicitly.** `flow-state` defaults to `$PWD`,
and on some harnesses the shell tool does NOT run in the directory the user
launched from — Hermes, for example, runs terminal commands in `$HOME`. A
bare `flow-state` there inspects the home directory, finds no `.planning/`,
and reports `MODE=AD-HOC` for every project. PROJECT-MODE then never triggers,
so the GSD phase state machine is silently unreachable and every request falls
through to the ad-hoc gstack lifecycle. Resolve the project directory first
(the repo the user named, or the one under discussion) and pass it.

This prints: mode (PROJECT / AD-HOC), current `.planning/` phase (if any),
open PRs, and deploy state — the "you are here" marker. Read it first so
mode-sensitive routes (build / ship / review) resolve correctly.

The canonical map lives in `LIFECYCLE-MAP.md` (same dir). Read it when you need the
full per-stage ownership table; the dispatch table below is the routing copy.

# FLOW — One Lifecycle Entrypoint

Load `ops-rules` before acting. Public repo (no personal data). Outbound: one draft → one approval → one send. If `AskUserQuestion` / `Workflow` are missing, follow Rule 10 in `ops-rules` (Hermes: numbered options / two-turn Telegram card; `delegate_task`).

**The one rule:** pick the abstraction level from repo state, then delegate
to the canonical tool.

- **PROJECT-MODE** (git root has `.planning/`): drive the **GSD phase state
  machine**; GSD phases call gstack/ops tools as sub-steps.
- **AD-HOC-MODE** (no `.planning/`): run the **gstack stateless lifecycle**.
- **OPS** (`/ops:*`): always available in either mode.

Route `$ARGUMENTS` (first token = intent) using this table:

### Routing notes

- **Hermes: gstack targets are files, not skills.** Every gstack route below
  (`/qa`, `/ship`, `/spec`, `/review`, `/cso`, `/autoplan`, `/canary`, `/retro`,
  `/learn`, `/office-hours`, `/design-consultation`, `/ios-qa`, `/browse`) lives
  OUTSIDE the indexed skills tree at `~/.local/share/gstack/<name>/SKILL.md`,
  deliberately, so its ~950k tokens do not load into every context.
  `skill_view("qa")` WILL fail. Load the route with
  `read_file ~/.local/share/gstack/<name>/SKILL.md`, then follow it. The
  `gstack-index` skill lists all 54 names. GSD routes are normal skills and do
  resolve via `skill_view` (`gsd-plan-phase`, `gsd-execute-phase`, ...).
- **`$REST`** = `$ARGUMENTS` with the leading intent token removed.
- **Mode resolution**: use the `MODE=` line from `flow-state`, and pass it the
  PROJECT path (see Runtime Context). PROJECT when the git root has
  `.planning/`; AD-HOC otherwise. If you did not pass a path and the harness
  runs shell commands somewhere other than the project (Hermes uses `$HOME`),
  `MODE` is meaningless — it describes that directory, not the user's work.
  A universal `AD-HOC` across unrelated projects is the symptom.
  "multi-project" = the user named >1 repo/project or asked for
  portfolio-wide work.
- **Delegation only.** This skill never does the work itself — it invokes the
  canonical command via the `Skill` tool (or prints the route if the target is
  a personal/plugin slash-command the model should call next). After routing,
  the target skill's own `## CLI/API Reference` governs execution.
- **Ambiguity**: if intent spans two stages, prefer the earliest unfulfilled
  stage for the current `flow-state` position.
- **`ops` passthrough**: for any `ops*` intent, forward the _entire_
  `$ARGUMENTS` to `/ops:ops` — it has its own sub-router; do not pre-parse it.

### Bare `/flow`

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty: `Read LIFECYCLE-MAP.md`, then reuse the Runtime
Context result above (the same `"$FLOW_STATE" "$FLOW_TARGET"` invocation — do
not call `bin/flow-state` bare, it would report on the harness's cwd rather
than the project), and present the lifecycle map with the current position
highlighted. Offer the next canonical stage as the suggested action.
**Do not auto-advance.**

## CLI/API Reference

Router only — no direct tool calls. `bin/flow-state` is the sole helper
(detects mode + position). All execution is delegated to the canonical
target skill after routing.
