# /ops:people

Load `ops-rules` before acting. Public repo (no personal data). Outbound: one draft → one approval → one send. If `AskUserQuestion` / `Workflow` are missing, follow Rule 10 in `ops-rules` (Hermes: numbered options / two-turn Telegram card; `delegate_task`).

Apple Contacts is source of truth. Notion "People" database is the working layer.

## Subcommands

| Subcommand               | What it does                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `sync` (default)         | Pull Apple Contacts via `pc contacts fetch`, upsert to Notion People DB  |
| `birthdays [--window 7]` | Who has a birthday/anniversary in the next N days                        |
| `overdue`                | Who's past their relationship-strength cadence and needs reach-out       |
| `whois <name>`           | Pull single person's full profile + last interaction across all channels |
| `bump <name>`            | Manually mark "I just talked to X" — resets last_contacted               |

## Notion People schema (auto-created on first run)

| Property              | Type                                                 | Source                                           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| name                  | title                                                | Apple Contacts                                   |
| emails                | multi-select                                         | Apple Contacts                                   |
| phones                | multi-select                                         | Apple Contacts                                   |
| birthday              | date                                                 | Apple Contacts (year may be missing)             |
| relationship_strength | select: close, active, dormant, professional, family | Heuristic + manual                               |
| last_contacted        | date                                                 | Computed from Gmail/Slack/iMessage/WhatsApp      |
| last_topic            | rich_text                                            | Last 1-line subject from any channel             |
| next_nudge_due        | date                                                 | Computed: last_contacted + cadence_for(strength) |
| brand_context         | multi-select: your brand/project codes               | Inferred from email domains/threads              |
| notes                 | rich_text                                            | Manual                                           |

## Cadences (configurable)

- `close` — 14 days (partner, parents, closest friends)
- `active` — 30 days (team, frequent collaborators)
- `professional` — 60 days (clients, partners)
- `dormant` — 180 days (warm but distant)
- `family` — birthday + anniversary + monthly check-in

## Sync logic

1. `pc contacts fetch --format json` — pull all Apple Contacts
2. For each contact: upsert into Notion People DB matched by email (primary) or phone
3. Walk last 30 days of Gmail/Slack/iMessage/WhatsApp threads to compute `last_contacted`
4. Compute `next_nudge_due = last_contacted + cadence_for(relationship_strength)`
5. Write a ledger entry: `kind=nudge`, `brand=OPS`, status=done

## Behavior

- First run will ask owner to confirm `relationship_strength` for top ~30 contacts
- Subsequent runs are silent unless something new is inferred
- Birthdays without years get treated as recurring annual; first detection asks owner to confirm before storing

## Related skills

- `relations` — the follow-up ledger and decision queue built on this directory
- `vip` — priority tiers; a `relationship_strength` of close/family is a VIP
  candidate signal, but a tier is only ever set through the `vip` skill's
  audited CLI path
- `ops-inbox` — consumes both when ranking a sweep

## Ledger writes

```bash
~/.claude-ops/bin/ledger claim --claim-key "people:sync:$(date +%F)" --kind nudge \
  --brand OPS --title "Apple Contacts → Notion sync" --source claude-ops
# ... sync ...
~/.claude-ops/bin/ledger resolve <id> --status done
```
