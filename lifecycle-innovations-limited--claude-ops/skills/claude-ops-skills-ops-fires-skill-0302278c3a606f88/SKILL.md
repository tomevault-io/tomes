# OPS ► FIRES

Load `ops-rules` before acting. Public repo (no personal data). Outbound: one draft → one approval → one send. If `AskUserQuestion` / `Workflow` are missing, follow Rule 10 in `ops-rules` (Hermes: numbered options / two-turn Telegram card; `delegate_task`).

## Runtime Context

Before executing, load available context:

1. **Daemon health**: Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/data/ops-ops-marketplace}/daemon-health.json`
   - Check `infra-monitor` service status — if not running, pre-gathered infra data may be stale
   - If `action_needed` is not null → surface it immediately as a potential fire

2. **Secrets**: AWS credentials are required for ECS/CloudWatch queries.

   ### Secret Resolution
   - First: check `$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `$AWS_PROFILE` env vars
   - Then: `doppler secrets get AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID --plain` (if `doppler` configured in prefs)
   - Then: use `password_manager_config.query_cmd` from preferences
   - Sentry token: `$SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` → `$SENTRY_TOKEN` → Doppler `claude-ops/prd/SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`. Resolved by `bin/ops-sentry`; no action needed here.
   - Sentry org and region: `preferences.json` `.partner_registry.sentry.{org,region_url}`. Sentry is region-sharded — issues are served by the org's own region host (e.g. `https://us.sentry.io`), not `sentry.io`, and querying the wrong region returns an empty list rather than an error. Omit `org` and the script discovers the first org the token can see.

3. **Preferences**: Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR}/preferences.json` for `secrets_manager` config to know which vault to query.

## Agent Teams support

If `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is set, use **Agent Teams** when dispatching multiple fix agents simultaneously. This enables:

- Fix agents share findings (e.g., API agent discovers DB is the root cause → infra agent pivots to DB fix)
- You can prioritize: "CRITICAL ECS issue first, then CI failures"
- Real-time progress: agents report as they find root causes, you can merge fixes in optimal order

**Team setup** (only when flag is enabled, dispatch phase):

```
TeamCreate("fire-fixers")
Agent(team_name="fire-fixers", name="fix-[service]", ...)
```

If the flag is NOT set, use standard parallel subagents.

## Pre-gathered infrastructure data

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-infra 2>/dev/null || echo '{"clusters":[],"error":"infra check failed"}'
```

### FinOps dashboard — open anomalies

Live anomaly feed from finops-dashboard (spend spikes, idle services,
expired credits, drift detections). High-severity items belong in the
FIRES table alongside infra outages. Falls open to `[]` if the dashboard
isn't configured.

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/finops-bridge.sh anomalies high 2>/dev/null || echo "[]"
```

## CI failures (last 24h)

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-ci 2>/dev/null || echo '[]'
```

## Sentry — unresolved issues (last 24h)

Pre-gathered so Sentry is never skipped. Sorted by event frequency. An
`error` field that is not null means the probe itself failed (missing or
expired token, unreachable API) — report that as a gap, and do NOT read an
empty `issues` list as "no errors in production".

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-sentry 2>/dev/null || echo '{"org":null,"issues":[],"error":"sentry probe failed"}'
```

## External projects health

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-external 2>/dev/null || echo '[]'
```

## Home automation (only if `home_automation` is configured in `$PREFS_PATH`)

```!
if jq -e '.home_automation' "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/data/ops-ops-marketplace}/preferences.json" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-home snapshot 2>/dev/null || echo '{"configured":true,"error":"home probe failed"}'
else
  echo '{"configured":false}'
fi
```

## Your task

Analyze the pre-gathered data — including external projects. Then run parallel checks:

1. **ECS health** — parse infra data for unhealthy services, stopped tasks, failed deployments.
2. **Sentry** — parse the pre-gathered Sentry data above; it is always present, so never report Sentry as unchecked. Classify by blast radius: an issue affecting many users or growing fast is HIGH, a warning-level issue with a handful of events is LOW. Only reach for `mcp__plugin_sentry_sentry__get_sentry_resource` (stack trace, breadcrumbs) or `analyze_issue_with_seer` when you are about to dispatch a fix agent for that issue. If the probe returned a non-null `error`, say Sentry could not be read and why — an empty list is not proof production is clean.
3. **CI** — parse CI data for failing pipelines, broken main/dev branches.
4. **GitHub Actions** — `gh run list --limit 20 --json status,conclusion,name,headBranch,createdAt 2>/dev/null`
5. **External projects** — parse ops-external data. Flag `auth_expired` as HIGH (credential rotation needed), `unreachable`/`degraded` as MEDIUM, `not_configured` as LOW.
6. **Home automation** (only if home snapshot returned `configured:true`) — classify Homey incidents:
   - Active critical alarm (smoke / water leak / security breach) → **P0 / CRITICAL** — cross-reference `/ops:ops-home alarm` for details.
   - Major device offline (gateway, hub, primary thermostat) → **P1 / HIGH**.
   - Energy spike > 3× 7-day baseline → **P2 / MEDIUM** — cross-reference `/ops:ops-home status`.
     If snapshot returned `configured:false`, skip silently.

Classify each issue by severity:

| Severity | Criteria                                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| CRITICAL | Service down, DB unreachable, auth broken         |
| HIGH     | Elevated error rate, deploy stuck, CI main broken |
| MEDIUM   | Non-critical service degraded, flaky tests        |
| LOW      | Warning-level, non-urgent                         |

```

Use **batched AskUserQuestion calls** (max 4 options each). Only show relevant actions (e.g., skip dispatch options if no issues found):

AskUserQuestion call 1:

```
  [Dispatch fix agent for [top critical issue]]
  [Dispatch fix agent for [second issue]]
  [View logs for [service]]
  [More...]
```

AskUserQuestion call 2 (only if "More..."):

```
  [Open Sentry dashboard]
  [Open GitHub Actions]
  [All clear — nothing to do]
```

If no fires: show "ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL" with last-checked timestamps.

## Pre-dispatch staleness check (MANDATORY)

The pre-gathered CI data is cached and may be minutes-to-hours old. Before
dispatching ANY fix agent, verify the failure is still red on its branch HEAD.
This is defense-in-depth: even after the `bin/ops-ci` "current-state" filter
(which only emits workflows whose latest run on a tracked branch is failing),
a fix may have landed in the seconds since the cache was written. Dispatching
to a self-resolved fire wastes Sonnet quota — typically 50–150k tokens per
agent before it figures out there's nothing to fix.

For each fire the user selects:

```bash
gh run list --repo "$REPO" --workflow "$WORKFLOW" --branch "$BRANCH" --limit 1 \
  --json conclusion,databaseId,createdAt --jq '.[0]'
```

- If `conclusion == "success"` → SKIP. Mark task completed with metadata `{resolution: "self-resolved-pre-dispatch"}`. Do NOT spawn agent.
- If `conclusion == "failure"` → proceed to dispatch.
- If `conclusion == null` (in_progress) → wait 30s, recheck once, then proceed if still null.

For workflows scoped only to PRs (no main/dev runs), check the PR's combined CI status instead: `gh pr checks <num> --repo "$REPO" --json bucket,name`.

## Dispatch fix agent

When user selects to fix an issue, use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm the scope before dispatching:

```
Dispatch fix agent for: [issue title]
  Severity: [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM]
  Repo: [repo]
  Error: [brief description]

  The agent will:
  - Investigate root cause in [repo]
  - Create feature branch with fix
  - Open PR for review

  [Dispatch agent]  [Show me the logs first]  [Skip — I'll fix manually]
```

On confirmation, spawn an Agent with:

- The error details and logs
- Access to the relevant repo
- Instruction to create a feature branch, fix, and open a PR
- Report back when done or blocked

Use the `agents/infra-monitor.md` agent definition for infra issues.

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a project alias, filter to that project's services only.

---

## Native tool usage

### Monitor — live service health

Use `Monitor` to stream ECS task logs or GitHub Actions runs when investigating fires:

```
Monitor(command: "aws logs tail /ecs/<service> --follow --since 5m")
```

### Tasks — incident tracking

Use `TaskCreate` for each active fire. Update with `TaskUpdate` as fires are investigated/fixed/escalated.

### WebFetch — status pages

When diagnosing fires, use `WebFetch` to check AWS status page (`https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status`), Vercel status, or third-party API status pages.

### WebSearch — known outage patterns

Use `WebSearch` to find if the error pattern matches a known AWS/infrastructure issue (e.g., "ECS task stopped CannotPullContainerError" → known ECR throttling).

---

## Credential Expiry & Rate Limit Warnings (Phase 16)

The ops-daemon surfaces two additional fire categories in `daemon-health.json`:

- `credential_warnings` — tokens/keys expiring within 7 days OR API keys older than 180 days. Fed by offline inspection of `preferences.json` (`*_expires_at`, `*_created_at` fields). No live API calls are made to validate credentials.
- `rate_limit_warnings` — integrations currently at ≥80% of their quota window. Fed by counters in `rate-limits.json`. Resets automatically when the window rolls over.

`/ops:fires` lists both alongside Sentry / infra / CI issues. Push notifications are dispatched by the daemon on the first crossing of the threshold — not re-sent until the next day (credentials) or window rollover (rate limits).

---

## Ledger Integration

**CLAIM_KEY:** `sentry:issue:<short_id>` (e.g. `sentry:issue:MY-PROJECT-1A2B`)

For non-Sentry fires (infra, CI, credential expiry), use:

- CI failure: `ci:run:<repo>:<run_id>`
- Credential expiry: `credential:expiry:<service>`

### Pre-flight skip-check

```bash
CLAIM_KEY="sentry:issue:<short_id>"
ledger query --claim-key "$CLAIM_KEY" --since=-PT24H
```

If `in_progress` or `done` exists, skip the issue. If `awaiting_sam` exists, surface
it as "fix already staged — needs your decision."

### Claim + resolve

```bash
# Claim when beginning to investigate/fix
ledger write \
  --claim-key "$CLAIM_KEY" \
  --kind "fix" \
  --status "in_progress" \
  --title "Fire: <issue title>" \
  --ttl-sec 7200

# Resolve after fix is applied or escalated
ledger write \
  --claim-key "$CLAIM_KEY" \
  --kind "fix" \
  --status "done" \
  --title "Fire: <issue title>" \
  --context "fixed: <brief resolution> | escalated: <reason>"
```
