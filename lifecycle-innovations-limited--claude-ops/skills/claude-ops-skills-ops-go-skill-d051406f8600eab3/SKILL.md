# OPS ► MORNING BRIEFING

Load `ops-rules` before acting. Public repo (no personal data). Outbound: one draft → one approval → one send. If `AskUserQuestion` / `Workflow` are missing, follow Rule 10 in `ops-rules` (Hermes: numbered options / two-turn Telegram card; `delegate_task`).

## Runtime Context

Before executing, load available context:

1. **Preferences**: Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/data/ops-ops-marketplace}/preferences.json`
   - `owner` — use in the greeting header ("Good morning, [owner]")
   - `timezone` — display all timestamps in this timezone
   - `default_channels` — which channels to include in unread summary

2. **Daemon health**: Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR}/daemon-health.json`
   - If `action_needed` is not null → surface it before the briefing
   - Check `whatsapp-bridge` status before including WhatsApp unread counts
   - Also check bridge liveness: `lsof -i :8080 | grep LISTEN`

3. **WhatsApp pre-check**: Only include WhatsApp data if bridge is running (`lsof -i :8080 | grep LISTEN`).

## CLI/API Reference

### whatsapp-bridge (WhatsApp — mcp**whatsapp**\*)

**Bridge health** — check before any WhatsApp operation:

- Running: `lsof -i :8080 | grep LISTEN` → proceed
- Not running → `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.${USER}.whatsapp-bridge`, wait 5s

| `mcp__whatsapp__list_messages` | `{chat_jid, limit, query}` | Message array with is_from_me, content, timestamp |

### gog CLI (Gmail/Calendar)

| Command                                                             | Usage                                                      | Output                                                  |

## Agent Teams support

If `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is set, use **Agent Teams** when gathering briefing data in parallel. This enables:

- Agents share context and can coordinate mid-flight
- You can steer priorities in real-time
- Agents report progress as they complete

**Team setup** (only when flag is enabled):

```
TeamCreate("go-team")
Agent(team_name="go-team", name="infra-scanner", prompt="Check ECS health, Vercel status, and CI failures across all clusters")
Agent(team_name="go-team", name="inbox-scanner", prompt="Scan unread messages across WhatsApp, Email, Slack, Telegram, Notion")
Agent(team_name="go-team", name="pr-scanner", prompt="Find open PRs needing action — reviews, CI fixes, merge-ready")
Agent(team_name="go-team", name="sprint-scanner", prompt="Check Linear sprint progress and GSD phase state across projects")
```

If the flag is NOT set, use standard fire-and-forget subagents.

## Pre-gathered data

All data below was collected by shell scripts in <10 seconds.

### FinOps snapshot (canonical state from finops-dashboard)

Pulls current burn, anomalies, and revenue from the dashboard. Fails open
to `{}` if `FINOPS_DASHBOARD_URL` / `FINOPS_OPS_API_TOKEN` are unset — in
that case the briefing falls back to the per-source data below.

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/finops-bridge.sh snapshot 2>/dev/null || echo "{}"
```

**Interpreting the snapshot — two different empty states, do NOT conflate:**

1. **`{}` or unreachable** → `FINOPS_DASHBOARD_URL` / `FINOPS_OPS_API_TOKEN`
   genuinely unset (or the dashboard is down). Report "FinOps creds unset" and
   fall back to per-source AWS Cost Explorer / `Infrastructure` below.
2. **Snapshot present (non-null `generated_at`) but `services_tracked: 0` and
   all-zero `current_month_spend`/`revenue_snapshot`** → dashboard reachable +
   authenticated, but its **ingest pipeline is unpopulated**. This is NOT a
   creds problem — do NOT report "token unset". Say "FinOps dashboard reachable
   but ingest empty" and fall back to per-source data for burn/revenue.

When the snapshot has non-zero `services_tracked`, prefer it for the
burn/runway/anomaly lines. The per-source `Infrastructure` and AWS Cost
Explorer sections below are the fallback for both empty states above.

**If dashboard `current_month_spend` is ≈ $0**, dual-check with the Usage-only
helper below — credits often zero the net bill while real burn is hundreds/day.

### AWS Usage burn (RECORD_TYPE=Usage — not credit-masked)

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/aws-usage-cost.sh snapshot 2>/dev/null || echo '{}'
```

Render in the briefing under a short `AWS BURN` line:
`MTD usage $X · 7d avg $Y/day · EOM pace $Z · credits mask $W (do not treat net $0 as low spend)`.
Flag a FIRE if any of the last 7 Usage days is >2× the 7d average.

### Infrastructure
```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-infra 2>/dev/null || echo '{"clusters":[],"error":"infra check failed"}'
```

### Git Status (all projects)

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-git 2>/dev/null || echo '[]'
```

### Open PRs

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-prs 2>/dev/null || echo '[]'
```

### CI Failures (last 24h)

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-ci 2>/dev/null || echo '[]'
```

### Unread Messages

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-unread 2>/dev/null || echo '{}'
```

### GSD State (active roadmaps)

```!
for d in $(jq -r '.projects[] | select(.gsd == true) | .paths[]' "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/registry.json" 2>/dev/null); do
  expanded="${d/#\~/$HOME}"
  if [ -f "$expanded/.planning/STATE.md" ]; then
    alias=$(basename "$expanded")
    phase=$(grep -m1 'current_phase' "$expanded/.planning/STATE.md" 2>/dev/null | head -1 || echo "unknown")
    progress=$(grep -m1 'progress' "$expanded/.planning/STATE.md" 2>/dev/null | head -1 || echo "unknown")
    echo "$alias: $phase | $progress"
  fi
done
```

### Competitor Intel

```!
source "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/competitor/context.sh" 2>/dev/null \
  && competitor_context --window-days 7 2>/dev/null \
  || echo '{"configured":false}'
```

### External Projects (non-repo)

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-external 2>/dev/null || echo '[]'
```

### Marketing (live channel data per project)

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-marketing-dash 2>/dev/null || echo '{}'
```

### Home (smart-home — only if `home_automation` is configured)

```!
if jq -e '.home_automation' "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/data/ops-ops-marketplace}/preferences.json" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-home snapshot 2>/dev/null || echo '{"configured":true,"error":"home probe failed"}'
else
  echo '{"configured":false}'
fi
```

### Calendar (today — all stores, not primary Google only)

Google Calendar **and** Notion calendars when Notion is configured. A miss on one store is not absence (Rule 9). Shows, travel, and appointments often live in a Notion show-schedule database and never sync to Google.

```!
gog calendar events --all --today --json --sort start 2>/dev/null | head -60 || echo "calendar unavailable"
```

Events include a `CalendarID` field (e.g. `work@example.com`, `personal@gmail.com`). When rendering the briefing, attribute each event with a short calendar label in parentheses — derive it from the CalendarID domain or summary (e.g. work account → `(work)`, personal Gmail → `(personal)`). Show total count + top 3 events sorted by start time with format: `HH:MM  Title (calendar)`.

**Notion calendars (required when Notion is configured):** read `$PREFS_PATH` `.channels.notion.calendars` (array of `{name, data_source_url}` — owner-local). If empty, `mcp__claude_ai_Notion__notion-search` for databases titled like "Show Schedule", "Calendar", "Appointments", then `notion-fetch` + `notion-query-data-sources` for today. Merge those rows into the briefing labelled `(notion)`. Do not report "no events today" until both Google `--all` and this Notion query have run.

Fallback: if `gog` is unavailable and `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_IDS` env var is set (comma-separated calendar IDs), fetch each ID individually:

```
for id in $(echo "$GOOGLE_CALENDAR_IDS" | tr ',' '\n'); do
  gog calendar events "$id" --today --json 2>/dev/null
done
```

## Your task

Analyze ALL the pre-gathered data above and present it as a morning briefing. Follow the ops-briefing output style.

**Format:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[If critical alarm active (smoke/water/security): prepend `⚠ CRITICAL` and route to FIRES at top]

UNREAD
[WhatsApp: N, Email: N, Slack: N workspace(s) configured (no scan), Notion: N items, Calendar: N events today]

TODAY'S PRIORITIES (ranked by revenue impact + urgency)
1. [action] — [project] — [why]
2. ...
3. ...

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

**Marketing section data source**: Read from `ops-marketing-dash` pre-gathered output (see Pre-gathered data section). If marketing data is present in the dash output, compute the health score inline (see ops-marketing SKILL.md health score formula). If ops-marketing-dash is not configured or returns empty marketing data, show `(marketing not configured — /ops:marketing setup)`.

**Priority ranking**: fires > degraded infra > CI failures > competitor alerts (high-severity, last 24h) > unread comms > ready-to-merge PRs > revenue-generating GSD work > stale projects.

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a project alias, focus the briefing on that project only.

After the briefing, use **batched AskUserQuestion calls** (max 4 options each) for the "What's next?" prompt. Show the top 3 priority actions + `[More...]` in the first call, then remaining actions + `[/ops-yolo — let me run your business today]` in the second call. Route to the appropriate ops skill or project.

For Slack counts: read the `channels.slack` object from the pre-gathered data and surface workspace presence ONLY. **Do NOT auto-scan Slack workspaces during briefings** — Slack scans are expensive, noisy, and frequently produce stale/unread counts that don't match the user's actual triage state. The user explicitly opted out of auto-scan on briefing surfaces.

- If `workspaces` array is present: render `Slack: N workspace(s) configured (<name1>, <name2>) — run /ops:ops-inbox to scan`.
- If `available: false` for all workspaces: show `Slack: not configured` and skip.
- Never call `mcp__claude_ai_Slack__*` or curl Slack APIs from this skill. Defer all Slack scans to `/ops:ops-inbox` where the user explicitly opts in.

For Notion counts: if `NOTION_MCP_ENABLED=true` and pre-gathered data shows Notion as available, use `mcp__claude_ai_Notion__notion-search` with `query: ""` sorted by `last_edited_time` descending to surface recently active pages. Then call `mcp__claude_ai_Notion__notion-get-comments` on the top results to find comments needing response. Note: Notion search does not support date range filters — sort by recency and limit to the first 10-20 results instead.

## Native tool usage

### Tasks — briefing action tracking

After presenting the briefing, create a `TaskCreate` for each recommended priority action. As the user works through them (or delegates via skill routing), update with `TaskUpdate`. This gives continuity across the session.

### Cron — scheduled briefings

After the first briefing, offer to schedule recurring briefings via `AskUserQuestion`:

```
  [Schedule daily at 9am]  [Schedule weekday mornings]  [No schedule]
```

Use `CronCreate` to set up the schedule. Show existing schedules with `CronList`.

### WebFetch — calendar enrichment

When `gog calendar` fails, use `WebFetch` with the Google Calendar API as fallback:

```
WebFetch(url: "https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/primary/events?timeMin=<today>T00:00:00Z&timeMax=<today>T23:59:59Z")
```

---

## Ledger Integration

**CLAIM_KEY:** `daily-brief:<YYYY-MM-DD>` (e.g. `daily-brief:2026-05-28`)

### Pre-flight skip-check

Before generating the briefing, check whether one was already produced today:

```bash
BRIEF_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
CLAIM_KEY="daily-brief:${BRIEF_DATE}"
ledger query --claim-key "$CLAIM_KEY" --since=-PT24H
```

If the query returns a `done` or `in_progress` entry, surface it to the user
("Briefing already ran today at HH:MM — rerun?") instead of re-fetching all sources.

### Claim + resolve

```bash
# Claim at briefing start
ledger write \
  --claim-key "$CLAIM_KEY" \
  --kind "file" \
  --status "in_progress" \
  --title "Morning briefing ${BRIEF_DATE}" \
  --ttl-sec 86400

# Resolve after briefing is presented to the user
ledger write \
  --claim-key "$CLAIM_KEY" \
  --kind "file" \
  --status "done" \
  --title "Morning briefing ${BRIEF_DATE}" \
  --context "N fires, N PRs, N unread"
```
