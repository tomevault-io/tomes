# OPS — Lazy Capability Router

This is the single broad discovery entry for the OPS plugin. Specialist skill and agent
bodies are intentionally absent from startup context.

## Route

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, invoke the `ops:ops-dash` skill.
2. Otherwise, read [the capability index](references/capabilities.json).
3. Match the user's complete request—not merely one keyword—to exactly one specialist skill.
4. Invoke that skill through the `Skill` tool using its exact namespaced name:
   `ops:<skill-name>`. Forward the user's original arguments and intent unchanged.
5. If two specialists genuinely fit, choose the narrower one. Ask only when the choice
   would materially change an external action.

Load `ops-rules` before acting. Public repo (no personal data). Outbound: one draft → one approval → one send. If `AskUserQuestion` / `Workflow` are missing, follow Rule 10 in `ops-rules` (Hermes: numbered options / two-turn Telegram card; `delegate_task`).

Do not reproduce or summarize a specialist workflow from the index. Invoke the specialist
so Claude Code loads its full body, allowed tools, effort, hooks, and turn budget on demand.
Never invoke `ops:ops` from this router; that would recurse.

The capability index is routing metadata, not authority to perform an action. All approval,
secrets, outbound-message, destructive-operation, and worktree gates remain owned by the
selected specialist and the global hooks.
