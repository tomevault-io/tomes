## Heartbeat-triggered runs

When asked to run a newly configured session heartbeat, read its saved prompt from the active Hermes database's `state_meta` entry `heartbeat:<session_id>`. Slash-command setup may not appear in conversation history, config.yaml, or cron/jobs.json. Execute that prompt in the current turn; do not invent a `hermes heartbeat` CLI command or mark a scheduler fire that did not occur.

Validate scan warnings with short live samples before changing the machine. Existing swap use alone is not active memory pressure; a transient blocked process or CPU spike does not justify cache purges or killing useful workers.

When host memory is available but swapping and stalls persist, inspect `memory.high`, `memory.events`, and `memory.pressure` at EVERY cgroup ancestor, not only the process's leaf. An inherited soft limit can force disk reclaim despite free host RAM. Establish the limit's original purpose before changing it; preserve service headroom, back up persistent settings, and verify that new high-limit events stop. Disk recovery can lag after the limit is corrected; do not call the whole host recovered from a configuration readback alone.

When a memory-limit fix reverts after daemon-reload, inspect all systemd drop-ins, including system.control and ordinary unit overrides. Align the stale conflicting source after backing it up; test a daemon-reload and read the live cgroup limit. A successful set-property alone does not prove reload persistence. Keep separate worker hard limits intact; diagnose worker heap settings against those limits rather than raising them indiscriminately.

## Runtime Context

Before scanning, load:

1. **Preferences**: `cat ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/data/ops-ops-marketplace}/preferences.json` — read `timezone` for timestamps

# OPS > SPEEDUP — System Optimizer

Load `ops-rules` before acting. Public repo (no personal data). Outbound: one draft → one approval → one send. If `AskUserQuestion` / `Workflow` are missing, follow Rule 10 in `ops-rules` (Hermes: numbered options / two-turn Telegram card; `delegate_task`).

## Architecture

The `bin/ops-speedup` binary is the single source of truth for probes AND actions. This skill's job is to:

1. Call the binary with the right flags based on user intent
2. Parse the JSON
3. Present a health score + cleanup report
4. Confirm destructive actions per plugin Rule 5
5. Invoke the binary's clean/deep/aggressive modes to execute

## CLI Reference — `bin/ops-speedup`

| Command                    | Purpose                                                                                   | Side effects                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `ops-speedup`              | Visual banner + hardware summary                                                          | None                                 |
| `ops-speedup --json`       | Quick JSON diagnostics (disk/mem/net only)                                                | None                                 |
| `ops-speedup --scan`       | Full parallel probe: disk + mem + CPU hogs + power hogs + GPU/ANE + startup               | None                                 |
| `ops-speedup --clean`      | Safe cleanup: caches, tmp, logs, demote daemons, DNS flush, kernel tune                   | Non-destructive                      |
| `ops-speedup --deep`       | `--clean` + Trash, DerivedData, simulators, animation cuts, launch-agent kill             | Removes files                        |
| `ops-speedup --aggressive` | `--deep` + unload launch agents, docker `--volumes`, stale `node_modules` (>14d), TCP BBR | Potentially breaking — confirm first |

All modes:

- Auto-detect OS (macOS / Linux / WSL / Windows) and dispatch OS-specific ops
- Idempotent — skip DerivedData/Metro/journal if last run was <1h ago
- Write telemetry to `~/.ops-speedup/history.jsonl`
- Only raise kernel tuning parameters, never lower
- Protected processes list blocks killing of shells, IDEs, daemons

## Phase 1 — Visual header

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-speedup 2>/dev/null || echo "SCAN_FAILED"
```

## Phase 2 — Full diagnostic scan (parallel, all probes)

```!
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-speedup --scan 2>/dev/null || echo '{}'
```

The binary already runs all probes in parallel. Do NOT add additional serial probe calls from this skill — they will duplicate work that's already in the JSON output.

## Phase 3 — Health score + cleanup report

Parse the JSON and render:

```

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Health score contract:**

Use `health.score` from the binary. Do not recalculate it in the skill and do not
lower health merely because caches, Trash, Downloads, or launch-agent counts are
large. The runtime-first model penalizes only evidence of current pressure or
actual risk:

- sustained low CPU idle / high runnable or uninterruptible process pressure
- memory pressure below 40%, swap over 1 GB, or zombie accumulation
- GPU utilization above 75/90%
- DNS over 100/500 ms, CLOSE_WAIT floods, or high TIME_WAIT accumulation
- long-lived heavy PIDs (alive at least 3h and high average/current CPU)
- disk only when it is genuinely scarce (90/97% used), never because cleanup is possible
- failed startup units, not the mere number of intentional launch agents

## Phase 4 — Present cleanup choice (max 4 options per AskUserQuestion)

AskUserQuestion call 1 — Cleanup scope:

```
  [Quick — caches, tmp, logs, DNS flush (~[N] GB)]
  [Deep — + Trash, DerivedData, simulators, animation cuts (~[N] GB)]
  [Aggressive — + launch-agent unload, stale node_modules, docker volumes (~[N] GB)]
  [More options...]
```

AskUserQuestion call 2 (only if "More options..."):

```
  [Custom — pick categories]
  [Memory — kill top RAM hogs]
  [Startup / Network / Skip...]
```

AskUserQuestion call 3 (only if "Startup / Network / Skip..."):

```
  [Startup — review & disable launch agents / systemd units]
  [Network — flush DNS, tune TCP, BBR (aggressive)]
  [Skip — just show the report]
```

## Phase 5 — Confirm destructive actions per Rule 5

Per plugin Rule 5, destructive actions require explicit per-action confirmation. Before running `--aggressive`:

```
About to run AGGRESSIVE cleanup. Each item is destructive:

  • Unload launch agents: [list]
  • Docker volume prune (may delete unmounted volumes): [N] MB
  • Stale node_modules (>14 days): [list of paths]
  • TCP congestion control → BBR (Linux only)

  [Proceed with all]  [Pick categories]  [Cancel]
```

If "Pick categories", batch per Rule 1 (max 4 options per `AskUserQuestion`).

## Phase 6 — Execute

Invoke the binary directly — it handles OS detection and dispatch:

```bash
# Quick clean
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-speedup --clean

# Deep clean
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-speedup --deep

# Aggressive (after confirmation)
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ops-speedup --aggressive
```

**Memory hog killing (option 5 from Phase 4):**

Top processes are already in the scan JSON (`cpu_hogs` / `power_hogs`). Present them in paginated `AskUserQuestion` calls (max 3 processes + `[More...]` per page, final page has `[Kill selected]` + `[Skip]`).

**NEVER kill**: kernel_task, launchd, WindowServer, loginwindow, Finder, Dock, systemd, init, shells (bash/zsh/fish), tmux, IDE processes (Cursor/Comet/Code), Claude, node, python, Xcode. The binary's PROTECTED_RE regex blocks these automatically.

## Phase 7 — Results

After cleanup, re-scan and diff:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 OPS > CLEANUP COMPLETE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 Reclaimed:  [N] GB
 Disk free:  [before] GB → [after] GB
 RAM free:   [before] MB → [after] MB
 Swap:       [before] MB → [after] MB
 Health:     [before]/100 → [after]/100
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

History: ~/.ops-speedup/history.jsonl
```

If user came from `/ops:dash`, offer `b) Back to dashboard`.

## Mode shortcuts

If `$ARGUMENTS` is:

- `scan` or empty — Phase 1-3 only (report, no cleanup)
- `clean` — run `ops-speedup --clean` automatically (safe)
- `deep` — run `ops-speedup --deep` automatically (after 1 confirmation)
- `auto` — run `ops-speedup --clean` automatically, print results
- `aggressive` — run `ops-speedup --aggressive` after per-item confirmations

## Trend analysis

`~/.ops-speedup/history.jsonl` is append-only. For trend questions ("is my disk filling up?", "is swap growing over time?"), read + graph:

```bash
tail -30 ~/.ops-speedup/history.jsonl | jq -r '[.ts, .ram_free_mb, .swap_mb, .disk_pct] | @tsv'
```
