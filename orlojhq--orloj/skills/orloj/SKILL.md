# Orloj Agent System Generator

You are helping a user scaffold a complete, ready-to-apply set of Orloj YAML manifests. The goal is to get them from "I have an idea for an agent system" to "I can `orlojctl apply` and run this" as quickly as possible — while generating correct, idiomatic YAML that follows Orloj conventions.

Before generating anything, read the resource schema reference at `references/resource-schemas.md` (relative to this skill's directory). It contains the canonical field definitions for every Orloj resource type. Consult it whenever you need to verify a field name, type, or default.

## How This Works

The generation flow has three phases: **understand**, **design**, and **generate**. Move through them conversationally — don't dump a wall of questions. Many users will give you enough in their first message to skip ahead.

### Phase 1: Understand the Use Case

Figure out what the user wants their agent system to do. You need to know:

1. **What's the goal?** What should the system produce or accomplish? (e.g., "weekly research brief", "customer support triage", "code review pipeline")
2. **What agents are involved?** The user might describe them explicitly ("a planner, a researcher, and a writer") or implicitly ("I want something that plans, researches, then writes"). Either works.
3. **How do they connect?** This determines the topology:
   - **Pipeline**: agents execute sequentially, each handing off to the next. Good for staged workflows (plan → research → write).
   - **Hierarchical**: a manager delegates to leads, leads delegate to workers, workers merge results. Good for cross-functional work with parallel branches.
   - **Swarm-loop**: a coordinator fans out to scouts who report back iteratively, then a synthesizer produces the final output. Good for exploratory tasks that benefit from multiple perspectives and refinement rounds.

If the user hasn't specified a topology, infer one from their description. If it's ambiguous, suggest the one that fits best and explain why — but keep it brief. Something like: "That sounds like a pipeline — each stage feeds the next. Does that match what you're thinking, or would you rather have parallel branches?"

4. **Which model provider?** Ask which LLM provider they want to use. Common options: OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama (local), Azure OpenAI. Default to OpenAI with `gpt-4o-mini` if they don't have a preference.

5. **Optional extras** — only ask about these if relevant to their use case. Don't overwhelm new users with options they don't need yet:
   - **Tools**: Does any agent need to call external tools (HTTP APIs, CLI commands, MCP servers)?
   - **Memory**: Should any agent persist context across runs (vector store)?
   - **Governance**: Do they need policies, roles, or tool permissions?
   - **Scheduling**: Should this run on a cron schedule?
   - **Webhooks**: Should external events trigger runs?

### Phase 2: Design the System

Once you understand the use case, design the agent system before generating YAML. Present a brief summary:

- The topology you'll use and why
- Each agent's name, role, and rough prompt direction
- The graph structure (which agents connect to which)
- Any optional resources (tools, memory, schedule, etc.)

Use a quick topology sketch — something like:

```
planner → researcher → writer    (pipeline)
```

or for hierarchical:

```
manager → research-lead → research-worker ─┐
       └→ social-lead   → social-worker  ──┤→ editor (wait_for_all)
```

Get confirmation before generating. A quick "Does this look right?" is enough.

### Phase 3: Generate the Manifests

Generate a complete, ready-to-apply set of YAML files. Follow these rules:

#### Naming Conventions

Use a short slug derived from the user's project name or description. Apply it consistently:

- Agents: `{slug}-{role}-agent` (e.g., `support-triage-agent`)
- System: `{slug}-system` (e.g., `support-system`)
- Task: `{slug}-task`
- Other resources: `{slug}-{descriptor}` (e.g., `support-web-search-tool`)

#### File Organization

Generate files as a flat directory the user can apply with `orlojctl apply -f <dir>/ --run`. The standard set:

| File | Resource | When to include |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| `secret-{provider}.yaml` | Secret | Always |
| `model-endpoint.yaml` | ModelEndpoint | Always |
| `agents/{role}.yaml` | Agent (one per agent) | Always |
| `agent-system.yaml` | AgentSystem | Always |
| `task.yaml` | Task | Always |
| `tool-{name}.yaml` | Tool | When agents use tools |
| `mcp-server-{name}.yaml` | McpServer | When agents use MCP tools |
| `memory-{name}.yaml` | Memory | When agents need persistence |
| `agent-policy.yaml` | AgentPolicy | When governance is needed |
| `agent-role-{name}.yaml` | AgentRole | When RBAC is needed |
| `tool-permission-{name}.yaml` | ToolPermission | When tool access control is needed |
| `task-template.yaml` | Task (mode: template) | When scheduling or webhooks are used |
| `task-schedule.yaml` | TaskSchedule | When cron scheduling is needed |
| `task-webhook.yaml` | TaskWebhook | When webhook triggers are needed |
| `secret-webhook.yaml` | Secret | When webhook auth is needed |

#### YAML Quality

- Always include `apiVersion: orloj.dev/v1` and the correct `kind`
- Include `labels` with `orloj.dev/pattern` and a descriptive use-case label on all resources
- Write clear, specific agent prompts — not generic one-liners. The prompt should tell the agent its role, what it receives from upstream, and what it should produce for downstream. 3-5 lines is a good target.
- Use sensible defaults for limits: `max_steps: 4` for coordination agents, `max_steps: 6` for worker agents, `timeout: 20s` for light agents, `timeout: 30s` for agents doing heavier work
- Always include `retry` and `message_retry` on Tasks — these are essential for production reliability
- For swarm-loop topologies, always set `max_turns` on the Task to prevent infinite loops
- Mark secrets with placeholder values and a comment: `# replace-with-your-actual-key`

#### Agent Prompt Quality

This is where you add real value. Don't write lazy one-line prompts. Each agent prompt should:

- State the agent's role clearly
- Describe what input it receives (from the task input or from upstream agents)
- Explain what output it should produce and in what form
- Set boundaries on scope (what the agent should NOT do)
- Be specific to the user's domain, not generic boilerplate

For example, instead of:
```
You are a researcher. Do research.
```

Write:
```
You are the research analyst for customer support triage.
You receive a categorized support ticket from the triage agent upstream.
Your job is to:
1. Identify the product area and relevant documentation
2. Check for known issues matching the customer's symptoms
3. Summarize findings in a structured format: diagnosis, confidence level, and recommended resolution path
Do not attempt to draft customer-facing responses — that's the writer's job.
```

#### Output Format

Write each file individually using the Write tool, placing them in a directory structure the user can browse. After writing all files, provide:

1. A summary of what was generated
2. The apply command: `orlojctl apply -f <directory>/ --run`
3. A reminder to replace secret placeholder values
4. Optionally, a brief note on what they might want to customize (prompts, model, limits)

## Topology-Specific Guidance

### Pipeline

The simplest topology. Use when work flows in one direction through stages.

- Graph is a simple chain: A → B → C
- Each agent gets output from the previous agent as context
- No join semantics needed
- Good for: content generation, data processing, review chains

### Hierarchical

Use when work needs to fan out to parallel branches and merge.

- A manager/coordinator delegates to multiple leads
- Leads delegate to workers
- Workers converge on an editor/aggregator node with `join.mode: wait_for_all`
- Good for: cross-functional projects, parallel research, multi-department workflows

Key detail: the merging agent (editor) needs `join.mode: wait_for_all` on its graph entry so it waits for all upstream branches before executing.

### Swarm-Loop

Use when the problem benefits from iterative refinement with multiple perspectives.

- A coordinator fans out to multiple scouts
- Scouts report back to the coordinator (bidirectional edges)
- Coordinator can dispatch multiple rounds of questions
- A synthesizer agent produces the final output
- The coordinator also has an edge to the synthesizer for when it's ready to conclude
- **Always set `max_turns` on the Task** to prevent infinite looping

Key detail: the swarm-loop is the only topology with bidirectional edges (scouts → coordinator → scouts). The `max_turns` field on the Task is the circuit-breaker.

## Edge Cases

- **Single agent**: Totally valid. Generate an AgentSystem with one agent and no graph edges. The system runs the agent once.
- **Conditional routing**: If the user describes "if X then agent A, else agent B", use `condition` on edges with `output_contains`, `output_matches`, or `default: true` for the fallback.
- **Mixed topologies**: Sometimes a user wants a pipeline where one stage fans out. That's fine — it's a hybrid. Use pipeline naming but add fan-out edges and a join where branches merge.

## What NOT to Do

- Don't generate resources the user didn't ask for. A simple pipeline doesn't need AgentPolicy, AgentRole, or ToolPermission.
- Don't use deprecated fields (e.g., `graph.agent.next` — always use `edges`).
- Don't generate Worker resources unless the user is setting up a distributed deployment.
- Don't over-explain Orloj concepts unless the user seems new. If they say "I want a swarm", they probably know what that means.
