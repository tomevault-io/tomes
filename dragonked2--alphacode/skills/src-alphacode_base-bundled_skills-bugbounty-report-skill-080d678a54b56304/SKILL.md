# REPORT WRITING — GATE-VALIDATED REPORTS

Every report must reference the 7-gate validation that the finding passed.

---

## PRE-SUBMISSION CHECKLIST

Before writing ANY report, verify the finding state:

```
FINDING STATE: VALIDATED (passed all 7 gates)
  Gate 1 (Scope): ✓ Asset in program scope
  Gate 2 (Boundary): ✓ Security boundary violation identified
  Gate 3 (Attacker): ✓ Realistic attacker capability
  Gate 4 (Reproducible): ✓ Deterministic reproduction
  Gate 5 (Impact): ✓ Concrete security impact
  Gate 6 (FP): ✓ False positive eliminated
  Gate 7 (Program): ✓ Program accepts this finding

IF ANY GATE FAILED → DO NOT WRITE REPORT
```

## SEVERITY MAPPING

### CVSS Scoring

| Severity | Score | Typical Findings |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| Critical | 9.0-10.0 | RCE, SQLi with data exfil, Auth bypass, ATO |
| High | 7.0-8.9 | SSRF, Stored XSS, IDOR with PII, Privilege escalation |
| Medium | 4.0-6.9 | CSRF, Open Redirect, Limited IDOR, Race condition |
| Low | 0.1-3.9 | Info disclosure, Limited impact findings |
| Info | 0.0 | Best practice violations (only if chained) |

### HackerOne Severity Guidelines

| Severity | Typical Payout | Examples |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Critical | $5,000-$50,000+ | RCE, Full ATO, SQLi, SSRF→RCE |
| High | $2,000-$10,000 | Stored XSS, SSRF, IDOR with sensitive data |
| Medium | $500-$2,000 | CSRF, Open Redirect, Limited IDOR |
| Low | $100-$500 | Info disclosure, Limited impact |
| None | $0-100 | Best practice (chained only) |

## WRITING BEST PRACTICES

### Title
- Be specific: "IDOR in /api/users/{id} allows reading any user's PII"
- Not generic: "Security Vulnerability Found"

### Summary
- One paragraph maximum
- What, where, impact
- No technical jargon

### Steps to Reproduce
- Numbered list
- Exact URLs and parameters
- Include request/response pairs
- Reproducible by anyone

### Impact
- Business impact, not just technical
- Quantify if possible (users affected, data exposed)
- Real-world scenario

### Remediation
- Specific, actionable recommendations
- Not just "fix the vulnerability"
- Include code examples if helpful

---

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Vague titles** — "Security Issue" vs "IDOR in /api/users/{id}"
2. **Missing impact** — Technical details without business context
3. **Unreproducible steps** — Steps that don't work for triagers
4. **Sensitive data** — Including real PII in reports
5. **Poor formatting** — Walls of text without structure
6. **Duplicate submissions** — Not checking Hacktivity first
7. **Out of scope** — Testing excluded assets
8. **Theoretical impact** — "Could potentially" instead of "did"

---

## EVIDENCE CLEANING

```bash
# Remove PII from screenshots
# Blur names, emails, phone numbers
# Use placeholder data

# Clean request/response pairs
# Remove session tokens
# Remove real credentials
# Use [REDACTED] for sensitive values

# Sanitize logs
# Remove IP addresses
# Remove usernames
# Use generic placeholders
```
