# Release notes

Use this skill when drafting or updating a release notes page at
`site/src/site/releasenotes/groovy-X.Y.adoc`. The release notes are
the most-read page on the website around release time and the most
quoted in third-party coverage, so accuracy and tone matter more here
than on most pages.

## When to use this skill

**Use it for:**

- Creating a new `groovy-X.Y.adoc` release notes page.
- Expanding an in-progress one (adding a section for a new feature
  area, a behaviour change, a breaking change).
- Polishing the page ahead of a final release (filling out the
  highlights, tightening prose, verifying issue links).

**Don't use it for:**

- Blog posts or announcement pages — those follow different conventions
  under `site/src/site/blog/` and `site/src/site/pages/`.
- Generator or template changes (`generator/`, `site/src/main/site/`) —
  those are generator-side concerns; this skill is content-only.
- Updating the changelog HTML linked from the bottom of the page — that
  is generated separately, not hand-edited.

## Read first

- [`RELEASE_NOTES_GUIDE.adoc`](../../../RELEASE_NOTES_GUIDE.adoc) —
  **the editorial source of truth** for release notes structure, the
  highlights / modules / topical / breaking-changes / JDK / addendum
  layout, the dual-audience drafting principle (humans + AI; `gapi:`
  on first class mention), enhanced-vs-new framing, and process tips.
  This skill is the working surface; that document is the map.
- [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) — overall AI-contributor guidance,
  ASF provenance rules, and content conventions.
- [`README.adoc`](../../../README.adoc) — site structure, build, and the
  asf-site branch warning.
- The most recent shipped release notes file (e.g.
  `site/src/site/releasenotes/groovy-5.0.adoc`) — copy its structure,
  attribute block, and link style. New release notes derive from the
  previous file, not from a blank template.

## Top failure modes to avoid

These are the recurring mistakes when working on release notes:

1. **Hallucinating JIRA issue numbers.** Every `GROOVY-NNNN` reference
   must resolve on <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY>.
   Verify before writing — a wrong number embarrasses publicly.
2. **Hallucinating API symbols, methods, or behaviours.** A release-notes
   bullet that describes a method that doesn't exist, or an option that
   was never added, is worse than no bullet. Cross-check each claim
   against the actual code in `apache/groovy` for the release branch.
3. **Wrong issue-link form.** The convention is
   `link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-NNNN[GROOVY-NNNN]`.
   Bare URLs and inconsistent formatting break the visual flow of the
   page and the rendered footnotes.
4. **Hand-coding `groovy-lang.org/gapi/...` URLs.** Use the `gapi:`
   macro instead — it is processed by `generator/src/main/groovy/generator/LinkMacroProcessor.groovy`
   and keeps links consistent across the site. (Same for any other
   custom link macros the generator defines.)
5. **Skipping the Groovydoc link on first class mention.** The *first*
   time a class appears in the document, link it via `gapi:` so both
   human and AI readers get the fully-qualified name. Subsequent
   mentions can use the short name. This is the dual-audience
   drafting rule — see [`RELEASE_NOTES_GUIDE.adoc`](../../../RELEASE_NOTES_GUIDE.adoc).
6. **Drive-by edits to unrelated sections.** Reformatting an existing
   section "for consistency" while adding a new one buries the real
   change in review and is rejected. Touch only what your task asks for.
7. **Restating the JIRA title verbatim.** A release notes bullet should
   explain *what changed and why a user cares*, not echo the issue
   summary. JIRA titles are written for triage; release notes are
   written for users.
8. **Missing or wrong "Breaking changes" coverage.** Behaviour changes
   that can break user code must be called out, with migration guidance.
   Don't bury them in feature sections. The canonical source list is
   the JIRA filter `labels = breaking AND fixVersion = X.Y.Z` — start
   there rather than `git log` or memory. Major breaking changes get
   their own subsection; the rest are bullets with issue links.
9. **Wrong JDK-requirements section.** Every release notes page ends
   with a JDK requirements block; the build/runtime JDK ranges must
   match what the release branch actually supports, not what the
   previous release supported.
10. **Forgetting the changelog link.** The page ends with a
    "More information" section linking to
    `../changelogs/changelog-X.Y.Z-unreleased.html` (or the released
    variant). Mismatched filenames produce a deadlink at publish time.
11. **Treating an `-alpha` / `-beta` / `-rc` page as final.** Pre-release
    pages are iterated on; preserve `-unreleased` markers and
    placeholder sections rather than deleting them prematurely.
12. **Forgetting that point releases append, not replace.** When `X.0.1`
    or later ships, its notes are added as an `Addendum for X.0.1`
    section *at the end of the same `groovy-X.Y.adoc` page*, not given
    their own file. Same for `X.0.2`, `X.0.3`, ...

## Procedure

1. **Start from the previous release.** Copy
   `site/src/site/releasenotes/groovy-<previous>.adoc` as the
   structural template. Adjust attribute block, version numbers, and
   anchor IDs (`[[GroovyX.Y-...]]`) before editing content.
2. **Source the issue list from JIRA, not from memory.** The JIRA
   filter / changelog for the release version is the authoritative
   list of what's in. Pull from there; don't infer from `git log`
   alone (commits without `GROOVY-NNNN` exist; issues without commits
   on the branch also exist).
3. **Group by user-facing theme, not by issue number.** Bullets
   covering the same area cluster under one section heading
   (e.g. "Extension method additions and improvements", "AST transform
   additions and improvements"). Order sections from most-impactful to
   least; "Breaking changes" goes near the end.
4. **Write each bullet in user-facing terms.** State the change, then
   the user impact, then the issue link. Use code samples for anything
   non-obvious — copy the existing AsciiDoc source-block style:

   ```asciidoc
   [source,groovy]
   ----
   def x = ...
   assert x == ...
   ----
   ```

5. **Use macros, not hand-coded URLs.** `gapi:` for API references;
   `link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-NNNN[GROOVY-NNNN]`
   for issues. Match the form already used in the file.
6. **Update the JDK requirements section.** State the build JDK floor,
   the runtime JDK floor, and the tested JDK range. Match what the
   release branch's CI actually exercises.
7. **Update the "More information" link.** Confirm the
   `changelog-X.Y.Z-...html` filename matches what the changelog
   generator will produce.
8. **Build the user site and check deadlinks.**

   ```
   ./gradlew :site-user:webzip
   ```

   Inspect `site-user/build/reports/` for deadlinks. Eyeball the
   rendered page under `site-user/build/site/releasenotes/` for
   broken includes, mis-rendered tables, or wrapped code blocks.

## Validation checklist

Before declaring the change ready:

- [ ] Every `GROOVY-NNNN` reference resolves on JIRA.
- [ ] Every API symbol, method name, or option mentioned exists in the
      release branch of `apache/groovy`.
- [ ] Issue links use the canonical `link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-NNNN[GROOVY-NNNN]`
      form; no bare URLs, no mismatched display text.
- [ ] API references use the `gapi:` macro, not hand-coded
      `groovy-lang.org/gapi/...` URLs.
- [ ] Bullets describe user-facing change and impact, not raw JIRA titles.
- [ ] Breaking / behaviour changes are in a dedicated section with
      migration guidance, not buried under feature headings.
- [ ] JDK requirements section reflects what this release branch
      actually supports.
- [ ] "More information" changelog link matches the generated filename
      (including `-unreleased` vs released suffix as appropriate).
- [ ] No edits to sections outside the scope of the task.
- [ ] No generated artefacts (`build/`, `*.cache`) staged for commit.
- [ ] `./gradlew :site-user:webzip` succeeds; deadlinks report is clean
      for new/changed links.
- [ ] Commit message references `GROOVY-NNNNN` where applicable; AI
      provenance trailer added if AI tooling assisted.

## Project-specific guidance

The standing editorial guidance for Groovy release notes lives in
[`RELEASE_NOTES_GUIDE.adoc`](../../../RELEASE_NOTES_GUIDE.adoc) at the
repository root. That document is the source of truth for:

- Document structure (Highlights → Modules → Topical → Breaking
  changes → JDK requirements → More information → Addenda).
- Highlights are written *last* even though they appear first.
- Module changes section: maven coordinates for new modules; mention
  removed / deprecated / status-changed modules; skip internal
  modules.
- Topical sections: 1–4 examples each; overflow into a list with a
  pointer to mainstream documentation.
- Enhanced features get a brief recap of what they build on; new
  features get context for why they're worth adding (other languages,
  industry trends).
- Dual-audience drafting (humans + AI), including `gapi:` on first
  class mention.
- Point releases append `Addendum for X.0.N` sections to the same
  `groovy-X.Y.adoc` file rather than getting their own file.

Read that guide before drafting; this skill's failure modes and
procedure are the AI-side guardrails on top of it.
