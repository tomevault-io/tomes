# Report Writing

Converts scattered materials—audio/video recordings, handwritten notes, diagrams, digital notes, and supplementary documents—into a single, well-formatted MS Word report. The skill automatically infers appropriate sections from content signals or follows a provided template/sample structure.

It is designed to run in **Claude Desktop** with:
- An MCP **filesystem** server (for listing/reading files and folders)
- An MCP **gaik-transcriber** server (for transcribing audio/video recordings)

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- User needs to create a report, summary, or documentation from source materials
- User mentions "create a report", "generate documentation", "summarize documents"
- User wants to consolidate multiple documents/media into a single structured deliverable
- User has recordings, notes, images, or documents to process into a report
- User needs meeting notes, meeting minutes, or meeting documentation
- User provides a template or sample and wants content filled in
- User asks to "write up" notes, "document this", or create a Word document from materials

## Inputs

**Required (at least one):**
- Audio/video recordings – transcribed using `gaik-transcriber:transcribe_audio`
- Handwritten notes (scanned images) – interpreted visually
- Digital notes (text files, markdown, etc.)
- Diagrams/sketches/figures (images)
- Source documents to synthesize

**Optional:**
- Supplementary documents (PowerPoint slides, PDF documents, Excel files)
- Output template (blank .docx with predefined headers, sections, logos)
- Sample output document (.docx or .pdf) defining style, format, tone, and length

**Required parameter:**
- `input_folder`: Path to the main input folder containing the required subfolder structure. If not provided, ask the user to specify it.

**Required folder structure:**
```
<input_folder>/
├── input_documents/     # Required: recordings, photos, notes, presentations, PDFs, etc.
├── templates/           # Optional: blank template with predefined headers, sections, logos
└── sample_documents/    # Optional: sample document defining style, format, tone, length
```

## Tooling Rules (Windows vs Linux Path Safety)

### Why this matters
On Windows, Claude Desktop + toolchains sometimes behave like they are in a POSIX shell, producing paths like `/mnt/c/...`.
Meanwhile, your MCP servers may run **native Windows Python**, expecting `C:\...`.
This mismatch can cause "file not found" or failing shell commands.

### Strict rules
1) **Prefer MCP filesystem tools for file/folder operations**
Use the filesystem server for listing and reading files instead of shell commands.

2) **Avoid bash commands on Windows**
If you must run a command on Windows, prefer **PowerShell**.

3) **When calling gaik-transcriber, prefer Windows drive-letter paths on Windows**
Pass file paths like `C:\Users\...\recording.m4a`.
If you only have a POSIX/WSL path (e.g., `/mnt/c/...`), convert it to a Windows path before calling the transcriber, or rely on the transcriber server's internal normalization (recommended).

4) **Never assume the environment is Linux**
Treat the runtime as OS-ambiguous and enforce the above rules to stay stable.

5) **Never do the following:**
NEVER run pip install, python -c, pdfplumber, or any ad-hoc parsing code for .pdf/.pptx/.xlsx.

NEVER use /mnt/user-data/uploads/... paths; only use paths returned by the MCP filesystem listing or the user-provided Windows folder.

If you are about to do any of the above, STOP and switch to the built-in PDF/PPTX/XLSX skills.

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Collect context
Ask (only if not provided):
- Report title or purpose (optional but recommended)
- Desired output format (Word document is default)
- Any special focus or sections to emphasize
- Target audience (if relevant)

## Step 1 — Validate input folder structure and capabilities

If the user has not specified an input folder path, ask for it and confirm it contains `input_documents/` (required).

### 1) Validate folder structure (MCP filesystem only)
Use the filesystem MCP tool to list:
- `<input_folder>`
- `<input_folder>\input_documents` (required)
- `<input_folder>\templates` (optional)
- `<input_folder>\sample_documents` (optional)

If `input_documents/` is missing or empty, stop and ask the user to add the source materials there.

### 2) Capability check (prevents Windows/Linux path loops for binaries)
Purpose: decide upfront whether this environment can process **binary** files from a Windows folder without requiring the user to upload them.

Inventory binary files found in:
- `<input_folder>\input_documents`
- `<input_folder>\templates`
- `<input_folder>\sample_documents`

Treat the following as **binary** (not safely readable via text tools):
- `.pdf`, `.pptx`, `.xlsx`, `.docx`

Decision:
- If ANY binary files exist and are ONLY in the Windows folder:
  - Assume you cannot process them directly unless you have a binary-capable tool.
  - The official Node filesystem MCP server supports reading text files and reading image/audio media, but does not guarantee generic binary reads for Office/PDF files.
  - Therefore:
    - If a dedicated MCP document-parser tool is available (recommended), use it for these files.
    - Otherwise, you MUST ask the user to upload/attach these binaries in Claude Desktop to process them with built-in PDF/PPTX/XLSX/DOCX skills.

If the user asks for "local-folder only" processing of PDF/PPTX/XLSX/DOCX:
- Explain that this requires either:
  - a binary-capable filesystem MCP server (supports base64/binary reads), or
  - a Windows-native document-parser MCP server.

Continue with the core workflow (transcription + text notes + images) regardless of the binary handling outcome.

### Step 2 — Inventory input files
From `input_documents/`, create a quick inventory:
- Recordings (audio/video)
- Images (handwritten notes, diagrams)
- Text documents (notes, drafts, emails, etc.)
- PDFs / slides (read text if possible; otherwise summarize)

### Step 3 — Transcribe recordings (gaik-transcriber MCP tool)
For each audio/video file, call:

- `gaik-transcriber:transcribe_audio`
  - `file_path`: full path to the recording
  - `enhanced`: false by default (true only if user asks for enhanced quality)

If transcription fails with "file not found":
- Re-check the path style and ensure Windows drive-letter paths on Windows.

#### Step 4 - Images (Handwritten Notes, Diagrams, Sketches, Figures)
For each image file (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp, .bmp, .tiff):
1. View the image using the appropriate tool
2. Interpret the image content (handwritten notes, diagrams, figures)
3. Create a textual description capturing all relevant information

#### Step 5 - Notes
Read files directly (.txt, .md, .rtf).
Use /mnt/skills/public/docx/SKILL.md for reading/writing .docx files.

## Step 6 — Supplementary documents (.pdf, .pptx, .xlsx, .docx)

Goal: extract relevant information from supplementary documents WITHOUT ad-hoc parsing code and WITHOUT Windows/Linux path mismatches.

### Non-negotiables (hard rules)
- NEVER run `cp`, `pip install`, `python -c`, `pdfplumber`, `soffice`, `pandoc`, or any ad-hoc parsing commands to read `.pdf/.pptx/.xlsx/.docx` from Windows paths.
- NEVER assume `C:\...` or `/mnt/c/...` is accessible inside a Linux sandbox.
- NEVER invent upload paths (e.g., `/mnt/user-data/uploads/...`) unless the environment explicitly provides them.
- Do not use the filesystem MCP server to "load built-in skill files." The filesystem server is for user-allowed directories, not Claude's internal skill library.

### Decision tree

A) If the supplementary file is uploaded/attached in Claude Desktop
- Use the corresponding built-in skill:
- View /mnt/skills/public/docx/SKILL.md skill for reading and editing DOCX files.
- View /mnt/skills/public/pdf/SKILL.md skill for reading PDF files.
- View /mnt/skills/public/xlsx/SKILL.md skill for reading and editing XLSX files.
- View /mnt/skills/public/pptx/SKILL.md skill for reading and editing PPTX files.

- Extract only relevant content for the report (key data, findings, timelines, etc.).
- Attribute extracted content by filename.

B) If the supplementary file is ONLY present in the Windows folder (discovered via `filesystem:list_directory`)
1) Text-like files (`.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.json`)
- Read via filesystem `read_text_file` and extract relevant content.

2) Binary files (`.pdf`, `.pptx`, `.xlsx`, `.docx`) — IMPORTANT
- Do NOT attempt conversion or parsing via sandbox tools (pandoc/python/soffice/etc.).
- If a dedicated MCP document-parser tool is available:
  - Call the parser using the Windows path and use returned extracted text/tables in synthesis.
- Otherwise:
  - Ask the user to upload/attach the file(s) in Claude Desktop.
  - Continue processing what you can (transcripts, notes, images) and list the missing binaries under "Missing inputs".

Template + samples:
- If templates/sample documents are `.docx/.pdf/.pptx/.xlsx` and are only on Windows disk:
  - Ask the user to upload them.
  - If not provided, proceed with a clean default structure.

### Output handling
- If supplementary binaries are unavailable (not uploaded, and no parser tool), clearly list them:
  - Missing inputs: `<filename1>`, `<filename2>`, ...
- Produce the report using available evidence and a default format.
- Do not block the entire workflow just because supplementary binaries are missing.

### Step 7: Fuse Information

Combine all processed inputs into a single consolidated text block with clear separators:

```
=== TRANSCRIPTION: <filename> ===
<transcribed content>

=== HANDWRITTEN NOTES: <filename> ===
<interpreted content>

=== DIGITAL NOTES: <filename> ===
<note content>

=== DIAGRAM/FIGURE: <filename> ===
<description of diagram/figure>

=== SUPPLEMENTARY: <filename> ===
<extracted content>
```

### Step 7.5: Analyze Content for Section Inference

After fusing all content, analyze it to determine which sections to include in the report.

**Content Signal Detection:**

| Content Signal | Inferred Section |
|----------------|------------------|
| Multiple speakers identified | "Participants/Attendees" in header |
| Explicit decisions ("we decided", "agreed to", "the decision is", "going forward we will") | "Decisions Made" section |
| Assigned tasks with owners ("[Name] will...", "Action:", "TODO:", "assigned to") | "Action Items" table |
| Unresolved questions ("need to figure out", "TBD on", "question is") | "Open Questions" section |
| Data/statistics present (numbers, percentages, measurements) | "Data Summary" or "Findings" section |
| Recommendations mentioned ("recommend", "suggest", "should consider") | "Recommendations" section |
| Timeline/dates discussed (specific dates, milestones, deadlines) | "Timeline" or "Schedule" section |
| Risks/issues mentioned ("risk", "concern", "issue", "blocker", "problem") | "Risks & Issues" section |
| Q&A pattern detected (question-answer exchanges) | "Key Questions & Answers" section |

**Section inclusion rule:** Only include sections where content signals are detected. Never create empty sections or placeholders.

### Step 8: Check for Template and Sample Documents

Check the dedicated subfolders for template and sample:

**Template (`<input_folder>/templates/`):**
- Look for a blank .docx file with predefined structure (headers, sections, logos)
- If multiple files exist, use the first .docx file found

**Sample (`<input_folder>/sample_documents/`):**
- Look for a .docx or .pdf file defining the required style, format, tone, and length
- If multiple files exist, use the first document found

**Priority order for format determination:**
1. **Template provided:** Use template structure exactly, fill in content
2. **Sample provided (no template):** Mirror sample's sections, style, tone, and length
3. **Neither:** Use content-inferred format (see Output Format section)

### Step 9: Generate the Deliverable

Read the docx skill before creating the document:
```
view /mnt/skills/public/docx/SKILL.md
```

Then follow the docx skill's "Creating a new Word document" workflow to generate the output.

**If template provided:** Copy the template and fill in sections according to the template structure.

**If sample provided (no template):** Create a new document mirroring the sample's section structure and style.

**If neither:** Create a new document using the content-inferred output format below.

### Step 10: Save and Present

1. Save the document to the `input_documents` folder
2. Use `present_files` to share with the user

## Output Format (Dynamic - adapts to template, sample, or content)

### When Template Provided
- Copy template exactly
- Fill placeholders with relevant content
- Preserve all formatting, headers, logos
- Do NOT add sections not in template

### When Sample Provided (no template)
- Extract section headings from sample
- Mirror section order and structure
- Match tone and approximate length
- Do NOT add sections not in sample

### When Neither (Content-Inferred Format)

Use this base structure, adding/removing sections based on content signals detected in Step 7.5:

```

## Guardrails

**Do:**
- Extract information faithfully from provided inputs
- Mark uncertain information as "TBD" or "unclear from source"
- Preserve original terminology and names from the inputs
- STRICTLY follow template/sample format when provided
- Only include sections where relevant content exists in inputs

**Do NOT:**
- Invent or hallucinate any information not present in inputs
- Add content not mentioned in source materials
- Make assumptions about data not explicitly stated
- Include sections if no relevant information exists for them
- Create empty sections with placeholder text like "None" or "N/A"

**If information is missing:**
- For required fields: Mark as "TBD" or "Not specified in source materials"
- For entire sections: Omit the section from the deliverable entirely
- If critical inputs are missing: Inform the user what additional materials would help

**Error handling:**
- If transcription fails: Report the error and continue with other inputs
- If a file cannot be parsed: Log the issue and proceed with remaining files
- If no usable inputs found: Ask the user to verify the folder path and file formats

## Examples
