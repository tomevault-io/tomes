# Universal App — agent guide

> **You're an agent** working in a **lean, universal Rayfin app** (a Microsoft
> Fabric Backend-as-a-Service app). It ships as a tiny "hello world" and is
> designed to **grow into whatever the user asks for** — a CRUD app, a charts
> dashboard, a Power BI analytics dashboard, or any mix. Your job is to grow it
> **on demand**, pulling in only the capabilities the request actually needs.

**Before you write any code:**

1. **Route first.** Read the **`capability-router` skill**
   (`.agents/skills/capability-router/SKILL.md`). It maps a plain-English request
   to a set of **capability packs**, and for each one tells you exactly what to
   turn on: which Fabric **service** to enable, which npm **modules** to install,
   which **code** to scaffold, and which **skill** to read for the patterns.
2. **Read before changing things.** Read the selected pack's skill before
   activating it. For Rayfin APIs, data, auth, configuration, or troubleshooting,
   follow the [rayfin-web-docs skill](.agents/skills/rayfin-web-docs/SKILL.md)
   before choosing APIs or changing services and dependencies.
3. **Stay lean.** Don't enable services, install modules, or copy in kit code the
   request doesn't need. The whole point of this template is that it starts small
   and only grows where the user is going.

## Rayfin documentation

Use the [official Rayfin documentation](https://rayfin.ai/) for platform
concepts, SDK APIs, permissions, limitations, and examples. This guide and the
pack skills cover **this template's integration and Fabricator workflow**, not a
second copy of the SDK reference.

The [rayfin-web-docs skill](.agents/skills/rayfin-web-docs/SKILL.md) makes this
lookup explicit for Rayfin-specific work: find the relevant pages, read their
guidance, and check version compatibility before implementation. Skip that
lookup for purely visual or unrelated React edits.

- Find relevant pages through the [documentation index](https://rayfin.ai/llms.txt)
  or the [documentation's agent entry point](https://rayfin.ai/AGENTS.md).
- Read the relevant [rules for coding agents](https://rayfin.ai/docs/reference/agent-rules.md)
  and [known limitations](https://rayfin.ai/docs/reference/known-limitations.md)
  before implementing Rayfin features.
- Append `.md` to a documentation page URL for its machine-readable version.
  Fetch only the pages needed for the selected capability, not the full corpus.

**Match the project's installed versions.** Read the CLI-generated
`.agents/skills/rayfin/SKILL.md` when present. Use the project's Rayfin MCP or
`npx rayfin docs` from the project root for version-matched APIs; the CLI works
without an MCP connection. Website pages carry `sdk_version` and `cli_version`
metadata: compare those with the resolved package versions before adopting
examples. Resolve conflicting guidance against the project's version-matched
sources rather than preserving a stale local example, guessing an API, or
upgrading packages just to match a website snippet.

Online docs are a reference, not a prerequisite for every edit: use the local
sources when offline. If no matching source is available, explain the gap
instead of inventing an API. Generic website deployment and development commands
do not override the [Fabricator workflow rules](#rules-fabricator-deploy-to-test).

## What ships in the base

A minimal React 19 + Vite app, Fabric-ready but deliberately bare:

- A no-auth `HomePage` (`src/pages/HomePage.tsx`) rendered by `src/App.tsx` — so
  it previews with **no backend** (`npm run preview`).
- **Fabric auth scaffolding, wired OFF** under `src/services/` +
  `src/hooks/AuthContext.tsx` — the base is a static, public page, so it needs no
  auth. **Wire auth for the default authenticated data workflow** (see Rules).
- **Graphein** wired in for charts: `src/components/Chart.tsx` (+ `useChart.ts`)
  renders a declarative `<Chart spec={…} />`. The `graphein-visuals` pack covers
  authoring specs.
- An **empty data schema** (`rayfin/data/schema.ts`) and `rayfin/rayfin.yml` with
  `auth` + `data` (mssql) + `staticHosting` enabled. The analytics stack is
  **absent** until the analytics pack turns it on.

## The capability packs

Each pack is a skill under `.agents/skills/`, trigger-gated so it only fires when
relevant. The router picks packs; the pack skill has the details.

| Pack (skill) | Turn it on when the user wants… |
|---|---|
| `authentication` | Sign-in, accounts, login, protected pages, per-user data |
| `data-modeling` | Records, CRUD, a database, entities, row-level security |
| `graphein-visuals` | Charts, graphs, KPIs, tables, a simple dashboard |
| `analytics` | Power BI / semantic-model dashboards, DAX, BI reporting |

The `analytics` pack also brings its own supporting skills (`build-workflow`,
`visuals`, `dax`, `fabric-data`, `app-design`, `headless-preview`) — read those
only when you're on the analytics path.

> **Fast path — one command.** A pack that ships a `pack.json` manifest turns on
> with a single idempotent command instead of dozens of manual steps:
>
> Read the pack skill before running its activation command.
>
> ```sh
> npm run pack:add -- <pack>      # e.g. analytics
> ```
>
> It enables the service, installs the pinned modules, copies the kit, wires the
> scripts, seeds a runnable demo, and runs `npm install`. **`analytics`** ships a
> manifest today; more capabilities/connectors will adopt the same mechanism.
> See `.agents/skills/capability-router/pack-manifest.md`.

## Rules (Fabricator deploy-to-test)

- **Make the requested code changes only**, and keep the project building —
  prefer small, correct increments.
- **Do NOT run `rayfin up` or otherwise deploy.** Fabricator runs the full
  `rayfin up` automatically after your changes and shows the deployed app in its
  preview.
- **Do NOT start dev servers or local test runners** (`npm run dev`, `vite`,
  `npm test`, …). Use Fabricator's deployment-backed preview for authenticated
  app behavior. Fast static checks (type-check, lint) and `npm run preview`
  (no backend) are fine; the analytics path validates visuals headlessly with
  `npm run preview -- --spec …`.
- **Stay within the requested capabilities.** Prefer native Rayfin capabilities
  and **stable, Fabric-supported** features. Don't add unrelated external
  integrations or enable experimental services unless requested; consult the
  documentation for service availability and limitations.
- **Installing npm modules is expected and fast** — Fabricator ships a warm
  offline package cache, so `npm install <module>` from a pack is quick. Install
  what a pack needs; don't pre-install everything.
- **Authenticated data is the default.** Pair `data-modeling` with
  `authentication` for normal app records, per-user data, and row-level security.
  A **static page over public data** needs no auth. If the user explicitly needs
  anonymous Rayfin data access, consult the
  [permissions guide](https://rayfin.ai/docs/data/permissions.md) and known
  limitations, and confirm the installed version and tenant prerequisites before
  changing that default. (Analytics uses its own Power BI model through the
  Fabric-authenticated embed proxy.)

When you finish editing, briefly summarize what you changed — Fabricator handles
the deploy.

## If you're asked to…

| Task | Start here |
|---|---|
| Build "an app" / anything, from scratch | **`capability-router`** — classify the request, then pull in packs |
| Add sign-in / accounts / per-user data | `authentication` |
| Store records / build CRUD / add a table | `data-modeling` |
| Restrict rows to their owner | `data-modeling` → row-level security |
| Add a chart / KPI / small dashboard | `graphein-visuals` |
| Build a Power BI / semantic-model dashboard | read **`analytics`**, then run **`npm run pack:add -- analytics`** and follow its sub-skills |
| Make it look polished / themed | the relevant pack's styling notes + Tailwind theme in `src/main.css` |
