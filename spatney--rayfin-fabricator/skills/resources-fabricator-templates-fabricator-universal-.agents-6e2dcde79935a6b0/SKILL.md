# Analytics capability pack

Power BI / semantic-model analytics dashboard (read-only). The `kit/**` tree is
**dormant reference code** — don't import it from the base app; scaffold it in.

## Turn it on — one command

```sh
npm run pack:add -- analytics
```

That runs the scaffolder (`scripts/scaffold.mjs`) against this pack's manifest
(`pack.json`) and, in one idempotent pass:

- disables the `data` service in `rayfin/rayfin.yml` (read-only analytics; `auth`
  + `staticHosting` stay on),
- adds the pinned analytics dependencies **and** the `build:fabric` / `preview` /
  `gallery` scripts to `package.json`,
- copies the whole dashboard kit into `src/` (`components/dashboard`, `hooks`,
  `lib`, `demo`, `global.css`, `fabric.generated.ts`), `fabric.yaml` to the root,
  and the headless-preview script to `scripts/`,
- seeds a runnable `src/App.tsx` + `src/main.tsx` (bundled Graphein demo over
  inlined data — never blank), leaving them alone if you've already edited them,
- runs a single `npm install`.

Flags: `--no-install` (skip install), `--dry-run` (print the plan, write nothing).

You now have a **runnable starter dashboard**. Validate visuals headlessly with
`npm run preview -- --spec <file>`; **Fabricator auto-deploys after the turn** and
validates the running app in its built-in browser — don't run `rayfin up` or a dev
server. (`npm run gallery` is a dev-only component gallery if you want to eyeball
the kit.)

## Then build the real thing

1. **Connect the semantic model** — edit `fabric.yaml`, then regenerate
   `src/fabric.generated.ts` (`npm run build:fabric` runs `fabric-app-data
   generate`). See `fabric-data`.
2. **Build the dashboard** — follow `build-workflow` (hero slice → preview →
   Fabricator auto-deploys → iterate), pulling in `visuals`, `dax`,
   `headless-preview`, and `app-design` as each phase needs them. Keep imports
   like `@/components/dashboard` unchanged.

`pack.json` is the source of truth for what gets installed and copied;
`MODULES.md` documents the dependency set and why.
