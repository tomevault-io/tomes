# Capability router — pick capabilities, enable services, install modules, activate skills

This is a **lean universal app** that grows on demand. Your first job for any
build request is to **route**: figure out which capabilities the request needs,
then turn on *only* those. Don't build everything; build toward what the user
asked for.

## The procedure

1. **Classify the request** into one or more capabilities using the matrix below.
   Most requests need 1–2 packs. When in doubt, start with the smallest set and
   grow later — you can always route again on the next turn.
2. **For each chosen pack, in order:**
   0. **If the pack ships a `pack.json`, scaffold it in one command** — `npm run
      pack:add -- <pack>` enables the service, installs the pinned modules,
      copies the kit, and wires scripts in one idempotent pass (see
      [`pack-manifest.md`](pack-manifest.md)). Today **`analytics`** ships one, so
      that whole path is a single command — then jump straight to reading the
      pack skill. Otherwise, do the manual steps below.
   1. **Enable the service** — edit `rayfin/rayfin.yml` (see the pack's row).
      Auth + data + static hosting are already on.
   2. **Install the modules** — `npm install <…>` for that pack. This is fast
      (Fabricator ships a warm offline cache), so just install what the pack
      needs. Skip modules that are already in `package.json`.
   3. **Scaffold the code** — create the entities / wiring / files the pack calls
      for (the pack's row says what; the pack's SKILL.md has the patterns).
   4. **Read the pack skill** — open `.agents/skills/<pack>/SKILL.md` and follow
      it for the real implementation details. Don't duplicate its guidance here.
3. **Keep it building** and let Fabricator auto-deploy. Don't run `rayfin up`, a
   dev server, or a local test runner (see `AGENTS.md`).

## Capability matrix

| Pack | Route here when the user wants… | Enable in `rayfin.yml` | Install | Scaffold | Then read |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **authentication** | sign-in, accounts, login, logout, protected pages, "who is the current user", per-user data | `auth` (already on) | — (scaffolding already present) | Wire `AuthProvider` + `bootstrapAuth()` in `src/main.tsx`; add the route guard in `src/App.tsx` | `authentication` |
| **data-modeling** | records, CRUD, a database, entities, lists, "save/store X", per-user rows, row-level security | `data` (already on, `dialect: mssql`) + `auth` | `@microsoft/rayfin-data` | Add entity classes under `rayfin/data/*.ts`; register them in `rayfin/data/schema.ts`; read/write via the `rayfin-client`; **wire auth** (Rayfin data is always authenticated) | `data-modeling` **+ `authentication`** |
| **graphein-visuals** | a chart, graph, plot, KPI, table, or small dashboard over app data | — | `graphein` (already present) | Author a `ChartSpec`, drop into `<Chart spec={…} />` (`src/components/Chart.tsx`) | `graphein-visuals` |
| **analytics** | a **Power BI / semantic-model** dashboard, DAX measures, BI reporting over an existing dataset | one command: **`npm run pack:add -- analytics`** (sets `auth` on / **`data` off**, installs modules, copies `kit/**`, seeds a runnable demo) | — (the command installs them) | — (the command copies the kit + seeds `App.tsx`/`main.tsx`); then wire the semantic model | `analytics` (then `build-workflow`, `visuals`, `dax`, `fabric-data`, `app-design`, `headless-preview`) |

## Notes on routing

- **App-building vs analytics are different shapes.** The app-building packs
  (`authentication`, `data-modeling`, `graphein-visuals`)
  build a normal interactive app over Rayfin data, with `data` enabled. The
  **`analytics`** pack builds a read-only dashboard over an external Power BI
  **semantic model** (`data` disabled, its own dashboard kit). If the user wants
  charts over **their own app's data**, use `graphein-visuals`; if they want a
  dashboard over an **existing Power BI dataset/report**, use `analytics`.
- **Charts everywhere.** `graphein-visuals` composes with the app-building packs
  (e.g. `data-modeling` for the data + `graphein-visuals` for the chart).
- **Row-level security** lives inside `data-modeling` — route there when the user
  says "each user only sees their own …".
- **Data implies auth.** Rayfin data is always accessed as an authenticated user
  (no anonymous access on Fabric), so any request that stores or reads app data —
  `data-modeling` especially — must **also wire `authentication`**; route to both.
  A **static page over public data** needs neither. (Analytics is separate: its
  Power BI model is read through the Fabric embed proxy, which Fabric
  authenticates — no app `AuthProvider` needed.)
- **Grow incrementally.** Ship the core of what was asked, let it deploy, then add
  the next capability. You don't have to wire every pack up front.
