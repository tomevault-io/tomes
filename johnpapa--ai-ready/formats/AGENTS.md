# AI-Ready Repo — Agent Guide

This is a **Copilot CLI skill** — not a traditional application. It contains no source code to build or test. The deliverable is a skill definition (`SKILL.md`) that teaches Copilot CLI how to make any repository AI-ready.

## Tech Stack

- **Content format:** Markdown, YAML, JSON
- **No runtime, build system, or test framework** — this is a documentation-driven project

## Build & Run

There is no build step. This repo ships markdown and JSON files that Copilot CLI reads directly.

**To test the skill locally:**

```bash
copilot plugin install johnpapa/ai-ready
```

Then start Copilot and invoke the skill:

```bash
copilot
```

```
make this repo ai-ready
```

## Testing

There is no automated test suite. Validation is:

1. **Skill integrity** — SKILL.md exists and frontmatter is valid
2. **Smoke test** — install the skill, invoke it on a sample repo, verify the analysis is correct and files are generated properly
3. **CI** — the workflow validates YAML syntax and skill frontmatter on every PR

## Key Patterns and Conventions

- **Skills live in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`** — each skill is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and step-by-step instructions
- **The skill is self-sufficient** — it uses Copilot's built-in tools (glob, grep, view, create) to analyze repos and generate files. No custom extensions or code required
- **Never overwrite existing files** — the skill checks for existing assets before generating
- **Issue/PR provenance is required** — issue and PR communication produced by this skill must explicitly mention AI Ready (for example: `Assisted by [ai-ready](https://github.com/johnpapa/ai-ready)`)
- **Docs must stay in sync** — when skill behavior changes, update `README.md`, `docs/how-it-works.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` to match repo standards
- **PR conflicts must be addressed** — when opening PRs, attempt conflict resolution first; if unresolved, ask for user direction

## Adding a New Skill

1. Create `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: skill-name
   description: What this skill does and when to invoke it
   ---
   ```
2. Write step-by-step instructions in the markdown body
3. Update `README.md` to mention the new skill
4. Update this file (`AGENTS.md`) to reflect the new structure

## Common Pitfalls

- **Don't add build/test/runtime dependencies** — this is a markdown-only project. Agents should not invent `npm install`, `pip install`, or any setup commands for this repo
- **SKILL.md frontmatter is required** — the `name` and `description` fields in the YAML frontmatter are how Copilot discovers and matches the skill to user requests
- **Test on real repos** — the only meaningful test is invoking the skill on different repo types (Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, etc.) and verifying the output
