# Research

Deep research on a topic, grounded in web sources and connected to Claudia's memory. Also handles context-aware lookups when current external information would improve quality.

## Usage
`/research [topic or question]`

## How It Works

This skill handles all research, from quick lookups to multi-source deep dives. Unlike a raw web search, research is deliberate: it checks memory first, builds queries using relationship context, searches strategically, fetches relevant sources, synthesizes findings, and stores key facts for future sessions.

## Tool Detection

Research works with whatever tools are available. Check what exists and adapt:

```
Research tool detection:
├── WebFetch available?          → Use for single-page fetches
├── WebSearch available?         → Use for broad searches
├── fetch MCP available?         → Use for cleaner page extraction
├── web-search MCP available?    → Use for DuckDuckGo search (no API key)
├── brave-search MCP available?  → Use for Brave search
├── firecrawl MCP available?     → Use for JS-heavy sites, multi-page crawls
└── Nothing available?           → Tell user honestly, suggest options
```

Never hard-depend on a specific tool. Use the best available. If multiple options exist, prefer in this order:
1. Built-in tools (WebFetch, WebSearch) - zero setup, always there
2. Free MCP servers (fetch, web-search) - no API keys
3. API-backed MCP servers (brave-search, firecrawl) - most capable

## Process

### 1. Scope the Research

Ask if not obvious from the topic:
```
"Before I dig in, a quick clarification:
- Are you looking for a quick answer or a thorough comparison?
- Any specific angle? (pricing, technical, competitive, general)"
```

If the topic is clear and narrow, skip this and go straight to work.

### 2. Check Memory First

Before reaching for the web, check what Claudia already knows:

```
memory_recall "[topic]":
├── Fresh results (< 7 days) → Use them, offer to refresh
│   "I have some context on this from [date]:
│    [summary of stored facts]
│    Want me to verify this is still current?"
├── Stale results (> 7 days) → Note staleness, offer to update
│   "Last time I looked into this was [date]. Let me refresh."
└── No results → Proceed to web research
```

This avoids redundant fetches and surfaces compounding knowledge.

### 3. Context-Aware Query Building

Use memory context to build better queries. Claudia knows things a search engine doesn't:

- **Project context:** User says "check the docs for that framework" → Claudia knows they mean Next.js because she remembers the project
- **Relationship context:** "See if their company announced anything" → Claudia knows "their" refers to Sarah's company, Acme Corp
- **Historical context:** "Has anything changed since we last looked?" → Claudia knows what was found last time and when

Turn vague intent into precise queries. This is the edge.

### 4. Research

**For factual lookups** (one clear answer expected):
- Search for the topic
- Fetch the most authoritative source
- Extract the answer
- Verify with a second source if the claim is significant

**For exploratory research** (understanding a topic):
- Search broadly
- Fetch 3-5 relevant pages
- Synthesize across sources
- Note where sources agree and disagree

**For comparative research** (evaluating options):
- Identify the options
- Fetch primary source for each
- Build comparison against criteria relevant to the user
- Use memory context to weigh what matters (budget, team size, timeline)

**For competitive/market research:**
- Fetch company pages, recent news, announcements
- Cross-reference with what Claudia knows about the user's position
- Focus on actionable intelligence, not general summaries

### 5. Synthesize and Report

```
## Research: [Topic]

### Summary
[2-3 paragraph synthesis - this is analysis, not copy-paste]

### Key Findings
1. **[Finding]** - [Detail with context]
2. **[Finding]** - [Detail with context]
3. **[Finding]** - [Detail with context]

### Comparison (if applicable)
| Criteria | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| [Relevant to user] | ... | ... | ... |

### Sources
- [Source 1](URL) (fetched [date])
- [Source 2](URL) (fetched [date])
- [Source 3](URL) (fetched [date])

### How This Connects
[Relate findings to user's projects, people, commitments, or decisions from memory]

### What I'd Flag
[Risks, opportunities, or things that surprised Claudia]

---

*Key facts stored in memory. I'll remember this next time the topic comes up.*
```

For quick lookups, use a condensed version:
```
[Answer grounded in fetched content]

Source: [URL] (fetched [date])
```

### 6. Store and Connect

After presenting findings:
- Store key facts via `memory_remember` with `source:web:` provenance
- Update relevant entities if research revealed new information
- Connect to existing relationships or projects where relevant

Store facts, not entire pages. Focus on:
- Specific data points (prices, dates, version numbers)
- Decisions or announcements that affect the user's work
- Technical details relevant to active projects
- Changes from previously known information

## Staleness Tracking

When research results are stored in memory, the source URL and fetch date are preserved. On future queries:

- If Claudia finds a memory tagged `source:web:*` that's older than 7 days, note this: "I have this from [date]. Want a fresh check?"
- If a user asks the same question as a previous session, surface the stored answer first, then offer to update
- During morning brief or weekly review, if stored research is relevant to upcoming commitments and older than 14 days, flag it as potentially stale

## Proactive Research Offers

Research can proactively offer to look things up when it detects value. This is not automatic fetching, it's offering.

**When to offer:**
- User states something as fact that might be outdated
- Discussion involves pricing, deadlines, or terms that change over time
- Meeting prep for a company Claudia hasn't researched recently
- User is making a decision that could benefit from current data

**How to offer:**
```
"That might have changed since [version/date]. Want me to check the current docs?"
```
```
"I have info on [topic] from [date]. Want me to see if anything's updated?"
```

**When NOT to offer:**
- User is in flow and hasn't paused for input
- The topic is clearly opinion-based, not fact-checkable
- User has previously declined similar offers in this session

## Tone

- Analytical, not encyclopedic. Synthesize, don't dump.
- Opinionated where warranted. "Based on what I know about your setup, option B seems strongest because..."
- Honest about limitations. "I could only find pricing for two of the three. The third might require a sales call."
- Concise. Research output should be shorter than the source material, not longer.

## Follow-Up Options

After presenting research:
```
"Want me to:
- Dig deeper on any of these?
- Draft something based on these findings?
- Set a reminder to re-check this in [timeframe]?
- Save this as a reference doc?"
```

## Without Web Tools

If no web tools are available:
```
"I don't have web access in this session. I can:
- Share what I know from memory and training
- Work with content you paste in
- Help you set up web search tools for future sessions

What works best?"
```

## Error Handling

When fetches fail (403, timeout, JS-only page):
```
"I couldn't access that page directly - [reason].
Options:
- Try a different URL if you have one
- Paste the content and I'll work with it
- [If enhanced MCP available] I can try with a different tool"
```

Never silently fail. Never guess what a page says. If the fetch didn't work, say so.

## Privacy and Consent

- **Sensitive domains** (competitor sites, personal information): Ask before fetching
- **User says "don't look that up":** Respect it. Don't offer again for that topic this session
- **All fetches are visible** in the tool call UI. Nothing happens in the background without the user seeing it

## Integration with Other Skills

### With Meeting Prep
- Research can enrich meeting prep with current company news, recent announcements
- Offer: "I'm prepping for your call with [person]. Want me to check [company]'s recent news?"

### With Risk Surfacer
- Research can verify or dismiss flagged risks
- Stale research on critical topics gets surfaced as a watch item

### With Connector Discovery
- When research hits limitations (JS rendering, multi-page crawl), suggest relevant MCP tools
