# Gravity LSP

- Use the opened document when the agent is editing it; pass a project-relative `path` for another `.ada` or `.gravity` file.
- Use `editor.gravity.diagnostics` after source changes and before calling a change validated. These are language-service diagnostics; use the AdaScript build workflow separately for project-level validation.
- Use `editor.gravity.completion`, `editor.gravity.hover`, and `editor.gravity.definition` to ask the same project-aware Gravity workspace service used by AdaEditor.
- Positions are zero-based LSP coordinates. `character` counts UTF-16 code units, including when the line contains emoji or other non-BMP characters.
- Gravity tools do not apply edits. Make changes through the open document or project file workflow, then request diagnostics again.
- `.ada` and `.gravity` use Gravity tooling. Keep Swift files on SourceKit-LSP.

## Mobile Studio

The mobile agent calls the same embedded GravityWorkspace directly; a stdio process is not required on iOS.
Pass `path` explicitly for hover, completion and definition. Omit it from diagnostics to check all project sources.
The workspace refreshes from disk after `files.write`, so newly created files and repairs are visible immediately.
For offline help, call `editor.docs.search/read`, `editor.api.describe`, `editor.components.describe`, and `editor.examples.list/read`.
Check `editor.project.context` for the current device runtime capabilities before using an API documented for another platform.
