# Ada Project Orientation

Start from the project rather than assumptions.

- Use `editor.project.context` to identify the open project and active document. Use `editor.scene.list_open` to find scene documents already open in the editor.
- Read `.ada/project.json` first. Treat `build.system`, declared source and resource roots, runtime entry, plugins, and run destination as authoritative.
- Use the term AdaScript in user-facing text. `adascript` is the canonical build-system value; `gravity` is legacy compatibility only.
- Read a nearby `AGENTS.md`, project README, and relevant AdaEngine DocC before choosing an API or file format.
- Keep every file operation inside the opened project or an explicitly allowed resource root.
- Prefer structured AdaEditor tools for scenes and assets when available. Preserve `schemaVersion` and unknown fields when editing documents directly.
- Do not claim success from a file write alone. Build or validate the narrowest affected path and use runtime inspection for behavior that can be launched.
