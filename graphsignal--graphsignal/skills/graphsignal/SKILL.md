# Graphsignal Profiler

Graphsignal is a GPU profiler built to be operated by an AI agent: install it, launch the workload under it, benchmark it, read the signals, change flags or code, measure again.

It observes a workload from a **sidecar process**: `graphsignal-run` launches the workload unmodified — no code changes, no imports — injects the CUPTI/ROCm activity library into it, and starts a watcher process that collects everything and serves it as one JSON document at `http://127.0.0.1:18259/signals`. Collected out of the box: GPU kernel/graph/transfer/sync timing (CUDA and ROCm), NVML device telemetry, process and host metrics, the engine's own Prometheus metrics (vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM), and errors extracted from console output. No profiling data is uploaded anywhere unless `GRAPHSIGNAL_API_KEY` is set.

## Install

Install as a uv tool, isolated from the workload environment:

```bash
UV_TOOL_BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin uv tool install 'graphsignal[cu12]'   # CUDA 12.x
# or
UV_TOOL_BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin uv tool install 'graphsignal[cu13]'   # CUDA 13.x
```

`UV_TOOL_BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin` puts `graphsignal-run` on `PATH` for every shell, including non-interactive scripts and containers. `pip install 'graphsignal[cu12]'` works too. The `cu12`/`cu13` extras are Linux-only, needed for GPU profiling; on AMD install without an extra (`uv tool install graphsignal`) — GPU profiling goes through AMD's `rocprofiler-sdk`, which ships with ROCm 7+.

Root is not required. Verify the install with `graphsignal-run --version`, and readiness after a launch with `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18259/health` → `{"status": "ok"}`.

## Run

Wrap the workload's launch command:

```bash
graphsignal-run vllm serve Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct --port 8000
graphsignal-run sglang serve --model-path <model> --port 8000
graphsignal-run trtllm-serve <model> --port 8000
graphsignal-run python my_app.py
```

Leading flags (before the command):

- `--metrics-port PORT` — where to scrape the engine's Prometheus metrics (default: derived from the engine's `--port`).
- `--listen-host HOST` — host to bind the `/signals` endpoint to (default `127.0.0.1`; set e.g. `0.0.0.0` to expose it for remote access; also settable via `GRAPHSIGNAL_LISTEN_HOST`).
- `--listen-port PORT` — port for the `/signals` endpoint (default `18259`; also settable via `GRAPHSIGNAL_LISTEN_PORT`).
- `--cuda-graph-trace {graph|node}` — granularity for CUDA graph launches (default `graph`; also settable via `GRAPHSIGNAL_CUDA_GRAPH_TRACE`). `graph` times each graph replay as a whole into `cuda_graphs_nanoseconds`. `node` times the kernels *inside* the graph individually into `cuda_kernels_nanoseconds` and leaves `cuda_graphs_nanoseconds` empty — that is how you rank kernels in an engine that replays CUDA graphs (vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM, llama.cpp in decode). It needs no extra privileges; it costs more CUPTI work per replay, so use it for an investigation, not for a long-running production run. Ignored on ROCm, where every dispatch is reported individually anyway.

Set `GRAPHSIGNAL_DEBUG=1` for verbose diagnostics.

## Typical workflow (reference)

One optimization iteration, for reference — not a prescription. Steps marked *optional* are skipped when they don't apply, and the order is yours to adapt:

1. Change code or config — whatever the previous iteration pointed at (flags, engine settings, a kernel).
2. Add probes (*optional* — when the built-ins can't see the suspect; see GPU probes below).
3. Compile (*optional* — only when code or probes changed).
4. Run via `graphsignal-run`.
5. Run a benchmark, or put representative load on the workload.
6. Get signals from `/signals`.
7. Identify bottlenecks (the read order below).
8. Next iteration — keep what helped, revert what didn't. Before recording a win, rebuild without probes and re-measure with
   no `graphsignal-run` (see Overhead).

## Read signals

While the workload is running:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:18259/signals
```

`GET /health` returns `{"status": "ok"}` when the watcher is up. **The endpoint lives only as long as the profiled workload** — read it while the process runs; after a crash, the last errors are in the workload's console output.

### Reaching it from another machine or container

The endpoint binds to `127.0.0.1`, so by default it is readable only from where the workload runs. Two ways across, both of which keep it on loopback at each end:

```bash
# Workload over ssh — forward the port, change nothing on the remote side
ssh -N -L 18259:127.0.0.1:18259 <host>

# Workload in Docker — bind past the container's loopback, publish to the host's
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:18259:18259 ... \
  graphsignal-run --listen-host 0.0.0.0 <workload command>
```

Then read `http://127.0.0.1:18259/signals` locally either way. On Linux, `docker run --network host` avoids needing both.

**`--listen-host 0.0.0.0` is the part to be careful with**: the endpoint is read-only but unauthenticated, so anything that can reach the address can read the profiling data. Inside a container it is the only way out, which is why the publish above pins it to the host's `127.0.0.1` rather than to every interface. Never pass `--listen-host 0.0.0.0` on a host that is directly on an untrusted network.

### Semantics

- **`null` = not measured, `0` = measured zero.**
- **Units live in field names**: a `_ns` field is epoch nanoseconds, a `_ts` field is epoch seconds, and query parameters without a suffix are epoch seconds.
- `start_ns` is when this instance started — the base every cumulative stat accumulates from.
- **gauge** — the latest sampled value (`stats.value`).
- **counter** — cumulative total since `start_ns` (`stats.total`).
- **histogram** — the one distribution type, cumulative: exact `count`, `sum`, `min`, `max` (`min`/`max` are lifetime extremes, and only sources that keep them report them — probes and the CUPTI/ROCm libraries do, Prometheus does not), `mean` (sum / count), and `p50`, `p95` computed from its bins (quantiles are bin values; resolution ≤25%). `sum / <iterations>` is the time per iteration of a probed region; `count` is how often it ran. A source with no buckets — a Prometheus summary — reports the totals with `p50`/`p95` as `null`; that is a whole histogram, not a broken one.
- **profile** — cumulative counters per named frame (e.g. time per kernel) with the number of samples that produced each, as `stats.frames` sorted by value descending.
- Metrics not updated for 10 minutes disappear from the report (dead workers age out).

### Key metric families

- `cuda_kernels_nanoseconds` / `rocm_kernels_nanoseconds` — profile of cumulative execution time per kernel (frames are raw mangled symbols). **In the default graph mode this holds only eagerly launched kernels**: kernels replayed from a CUDA graph are reported as their graph instead. Rerun with `--cuda-graph-trace node` to get them here.
- `cuda_graphs_nanoseconds` — profile of cumulative replay time per unique CUDA-graph structure (frames are 16-hex structural signatures). Empty in node mode.
- `cuda_graph_trace_mode` — gauge, the graph tracing granularity in effect: `0` = graph (default), `1` = node. Read it before concluding anything from an empty `cuda_graphs_nanoseconds` or a sparse `cuda_kernels_nanoseconds`.
- `cuda_memcpy_nanoseconds` / `cuda_memset_nanoseconds` / `cuda_sync_nanoseconds` — profiles of cumulative time per transfer kind / sync type; `cuda_memcpy_bytes{kind}` / `cuda_memset_bytes{kind}` counters carry the volumes.
- `gpu_*` — NVML telemetry per device (utilization, memory, power, clocks, throttling, NVLink/PCIe, `gpu_xid_critical_errors`).
- `process_*`, `host_*` — CPU/memory per process and host.
- Engine metrics scraped from Prometheus (vLLM `vllm:*`, SGLang `sglang:*`, TRT-LLM) appear under their original names. Both `histogram` and `summary` families become one Graphsignal histogram: exact `count`/`sum` always, plus `p50`/`p95` where the family exposes `le` buckets.
- User probe metrics (see GPU probes below) appear under their registered names.

### How to interpret (suggested order)

1. Check `errors` first — a crash or XID error explains more than any metric.
2. Check `gpu_utilization_percent` and `gpu_memory_*` per device — is the GPU busy, starved, or memory-bound?
3. Read the `cuda_kernels_nanoseconds` and `cuda_graphs_nanoseconds` profiles — which frames dominate cumulative time (they are sorted descending)? If the graph profile holds most of the GPU time and the kernel profile looks thin, the engine replays CUDA graphs and you are seeing whole replays; rerun with `--cuda-graph-trace node` to rank the kernels inside the graph. `cuda_graph_trace_mode` says which mode produced the payload you are reading.
4. Check the `cuda_sync_nanoseconds` profile and `cuda_memcpy_nanoseconds` profile/byte counters — heavy host synchronization or transfer volume signals CPU/IO bottlenecks.
5. Correlate with engine metrics (queue depth, running requests, token throughput) from the Prometheus import.

Each read is the latest snapshot; trends come from diffing cumulative counts/sums between reads. When and how often to read is yours to decide — per benchmark run, per iteration, or continuously.

## Overhead (and what it means for the numbers you report)

Three collection modes, cheapest first. All three are privilege-free — none of them needs root, `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, or a relaxed
`RmProfilingAdminOnly`.

| Mode | How | Cost | Use it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Kernels** (default) | just `graphsignal-run` | on a GPU-bound workload, within run-to-run noise; a few percent at most on one that launches many small kernels per second | always, including long production runs |
| **Graph node trace** | `--cuda-graph-trace node` | free on a GPU-bound workload; up to roughly ten percent on a host-bound one, because one record per replay becomes one per kernel inside it | to rank kernels in a graph-replaying engine, then switch back |
| **GPU probes** | instrument the code | not measurable at production density (a few instruments per request/iteration); a few percent when dense enough to split one kernel into phases | **safe to ship in production**; dense instrumentation for investigation |

Overhead tracks how often the workload asks the driver to do something, not model size: an engine that replays a whole decode
step as one CUDA graph has almost nothing to record, while one that launches thousands of small kernels pays per record.
Measured figures and the method: https://graphsignal.com/docs/guides/profiler-overhead/

**Probes are safe to leave in production code.** The record path is lock-free and allocation-free (a few relaxed atomics), a
record on a failed registration is a no-op, and instruments are inert when nothing reads them — a build carrying probes behaves
the same whether or not a profiler is attached. So instrument the code once and ship it; there is no need to strip probes or keep
a separate build. What costs something is *density*: a few instruments per request or per decode step is not measurable, while
recording hundreds to thousands per iteration to split one kernel into phases costs a few percent.

**Rules that keep your conclusions valid.** These matter more than the exact percentages:

1. **A latency measured under the profiler is not the workload's latency.** Take the number you report — "the engine does X ms
   per token" — from a run with no `graphsignal-run` and no probes. Use the profiled run to find *where* the time goes, not to
   state how much there is.
2. **Compare like with like.** A/B two candidate changes under identical conditions: same mode, same build flags, same prompt,
   same warm-up. Never compare a probed build against an unprobed one, or a node-mode run against a default-mode one.
3. **Re-measure without dense instrumentation.** When a change is kept, re-run the benchmark on a build without the dense
   investigation probes before recording the win; that overhead can be larger than the improvement you are chasing. Probes left in
   at production density do not need removing.
4. **Say which mode produced a payload.** `cuda_graph_trace_mode` is in every payload for exactly this reason, and it explains an
   empty `cuda_graphs_nanoseconds` or a thin `cuda_kernels_nanoseconds`.

## GPU probes (instrumenting code)

The built-in `cuda_kernels_nanoseconds` profile already breaks time down per kernel symbol, for free — and `--cuda-graph-trace node` extends that to the kernels inside a CUDA graph. Probes are for what CUPTI structurally cannot see: the stages *inside* one kernel — a megakernel's phases, a fused op's steps — and anything whose name is a concept in your code rather than a linker symbol (per layer, per op, per request stage, queue depths). Reach for them when a built-in profile names the hot kernel and the next question is which part of it. They are safe to ship in production (see Overhead above); cost follows record density, so probe the one place you have already narrowed down to, and when the instrumentation is dense take headline numbers from a build without it.

The probe API is a single vendorable header (Apache-2.0, C++17, no dependencies); an AI agent can insert probes, rebuild, rerun under `graphsignal-run`, and read the results from `/signals` in the same loop:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphsignal/graphsignal/main/include/graphsignal/probe.h -o third_party/graphsignal/probe.h --create-dirs
```

**Build requirements.** The file you edit is usually one `nvcc` (or `hipcc`) compiles, since the probe goes inside the kernel. Compile that translation unit with `-std=c++17` and put the vendored directory on the include path — `nvcc -std=c++17 -Ithird_party ...`. The header `#error`s on anything older, so a target still defaulting to `gnu++14` fails immediately and reads like a broken header. For device probes also vendor `probe_cuda.h` (or `probe_rocm.h`) beside `probe.h`.

Four instrument types, registered once (idempotent per name+tags) and recorded lock-free; every record function is a safe no-op on NULL:

```cpp
#include <graphsignal/probe.h>

static graphsignal_probe_entry* g_batch_ns;   // GRAPHSIGNAL_HISTOGRAM
static graphsignal_probe_entry* g_ops;        // GRAPHSIGNAL_PROFILE

void init() {
    g_batch_ns = graphsignal_probe_register(
        "myengine_batch_duration_nanoseconds", GRAPHSIGNAL_HISTOGRAM, NULL, NULL, 0);
    g_ops = graphsignal_probe_register(
        "myengine_ops_nanoseconds", GRAPHSIGNAL_PROFILE, NULL, NULL, 0);
}

void run_op(const char* op_name) {
    uint64_t t0 = graphsignal_now_ns();
    // ... work ...
    graphsignal_record(g_batch_ns, graphsignal_now_ns() - t0);                     // histogram
    graphsignal_profile_add_by_name(g_ops, op_name, graphsignal_now_ns() - t0);   // profile frame
}
```

`GRAPHSIGNAL_GAUGE` (`graphsignal_set`) and `GRAPHSIGNAL_COUNTER` (`graphsignal_add`) work the same way. A profile maps up to 250 named frames to a cumulative value plus a sample count — pick it when the breakdown itself is the question (time per op, per layer, per anything nameable).

Inside CUDA kernels, register with `<graphsignal/probe_cuda.h>` and record from device code (HIP: `<graphsignal/probe_rocm.h>`). Device-storage instruments are **histograms only** — register on the host, pass `graphsignal_probe_device_data(...)` into the launch, and record from whichever lane you choose (one per block is the usual answer):

```cpp
static graphsignal_probe_entry* g_tile_ns;

void init() {
    g_tile_ns = graphsignal_probe_register_cuda(
        "mykernels_tile_duration_nanoseconds", NULL, NULL, 0);
}

__global__ void my_kernel(..., graphsignal_instrument_data* tile_ns) {
    unsigned long long t0 = graphsignal_gtimer();
    // ... tile work ...
    if (threadIdx.x == 0) {  // one recording lane per block
        GRAPHSIGNAL_RECORD(tile_ns, graphsignal_gtimer() - t0);
    }
}

// launch: my_kernel<<<...>>>(..., graphsignal_probe_device_data(g_tile_ns));
```

On CUDA `graphsignal_gtimer()` reads `%globaltimer` and is already nanoseconds. **On HIP it is `wall_clock64()` ticks, not nanoseconds** — either convert with `hipDeviceAttributeWallClockRate` (kHz) or record raw ticks and name the metric for what it holds, so a `_nanoseconds` suffix never lies about ROCm numbers.

Conventions and semantics:

- Values are unsigned 64-bit integers (nanoseconds, bytes, counts). Instruments are cumulative forever — never reset; readers snapshot and diff.
- Name metrics with underscores and a unit suffix, like the built-ins: `myengine_batch_duration_nanoseconds`, `myengine_bytes_in`.
- Give a rebuild two ticks before you read it. A newly registered probe reaches the shm file on the writer's next 1s tick and `/signals` on the recorder's next 1s tick — let the workload run ~3s before curling, or a probe that works looks like one that never registered.
- Many device instruments (per block, per SM, per phase: hundreds or thousands) should come from one pool — `graphsignal_probe_cuda_pool_init(&pool, N)` once, then `graphsignal_probe_register_cuda_pooled(&pool, name, keys, vals, ntags)` per instrument. The pool is one `cudaMalloc`, and the profiler reads a contiguous pool with one copy per second instead of one per instrument (a thousand separate `graphsignal_probe_register_cuda` blocks cost a thousand driver round trips per write).
- Registration can fail silently, and this is the one failure worth guarding. Past 4096 instruments per process (or on allocation failure) `graphsignal_probe_register` returns `NULL`, every record on it becomes a no-op, and nothing is logged — the only evidence is the `graphsignal_probe_dropped_instruments` counter in `/signals`. Register each instrument once at init; never register per call in a loop over shapes, layer names, or request ids.
- Probes are inert without a reader. Under `graphsignal-run`, values appear in `/signals` automatically alongside the built-in metrics — histograms with exact `count`/`sum`/`min`/`max` plus bin quantiles, profiles as frames with values and sample counts.

## Production feedback loop (optional)

With `GRAPHSIGNAL_API_KEY` set, the profiler also uploads signals to Graphsignal so they can be retrieved later from the server via the Signals API. Every request takes the key in an `X-API-Key` header; the base URL is `https://api.graphsignal.com` unless overridden with `GRAPHSIGNAL_API_BASE`.

List instances that have reported (each profiler run is one instance, identified by its `instance.id` tag):

```bash
curl -s -H "X-API-Key: $GRAPHSIGNAL_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.graphsignal.com/api/v1/instances"
```

Returns `{"instances": [{"instance_id", "resource_id", "tags", "attributes", "first_seen_ts", "last_seen_ts"}]}` for the last 24 hours by default; pass `start`/`end` (epoch seconds) for another window.

Read an instance's counter snapshot — the same shape as the local `/signals` payload above (the top block is `platform` instead of `profiler`):

```bash
curl -s -H "X-API-Key: $GRAPHSIGNAL_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.graphsignal.com/api/v1/signals?instance_id=<id>&start=<epoch seconds>"
```

`instance_id` is required (take it from `/api/v1/instances` or from the local payload's `context`). `start` is required: counters, histograms and profiles accumulate from that instant to the snapshot instant, rather than from run start — production instances can run longer than the server retains data. The payload echoes it as `start_ns`, where the local endpoint reports the instance start. Pass `end=<epoch seconds>` for a snapshot as of that moment instead of now. Consecutive reads tile without double counting when each passes the previous response's `payload_ns / 1e9` as its `start`.


## Reporting issues

If you find a **real bug in the profiler** — not a misconfiguration and not a problem in the workload — write up a report and ask the user to send it. Do not send it yourself.

It is a profiler bug when the profiler itself misbehaves: it crashes or hangs, `/signals` returns malformed JSON or an obviously wrong value (a negative duration, a counter that decreases, a metric that vanishes while the workload is plainly still doing the work), a probe that registered never appears, `graphsignal-run` mangles the command line it was given, or the profiler changes the workload's behavior.

It is **not** a profiler bug when: the workload itself fails (read `errors` and the console output — a CUDA OOM or an engine argument error is the workload's), a metric is `null` because nothing measured it (no GPU, no Prometheus endpoint, no `cu12`/`cu13` extra installed), `/signals` is unreachable because the workload already exited or is bound to another port, or a probe returned `NULL` at registration (check `graphsignal_probe_dropped_instruments`). Rule out all of these first — say which ones you ruled out in the report.

Collect, and reproduce with `GRAPHSIGNAL_DEBUG=1` before writing it up:

Include the profiler's own environment variables in the diagnostics — `GRAPHSIGNAL_DEBUG`, `GRAPHSIGNAL_CUDA_GRAPH_TRACE`, `GRAPHSIGNAL_LISTEN_HOST`/`GRAPHSIGNAL_LISTEN_PORT`, and whether `GRAPHSIGNAL_API_KEY` is set (never its value) — plus the `cuda_graph_trace_mode` gauge from the payload: a missing `cuda_graphs_nanoseconds` in node mode, or a thin `cuda_kernels_nanoseconds` in graph mode, is the profiler working as documented, not a bug.

```bash
graphsignal-run --version
python -c "import platform,sys; print(platform.platform(), sys.version)"
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,driver_version --format=csv,noheader   # or rocm-smi
GRAPHSIGNAL_DEBUG=1 graphsignal-run <the exact command> 2>&1 | tail -50
```

The report should state: the profiler version and platform above, the exact `graphsignal-run` command, what you expected and what happened instead, the smallest reproduction you found, the `GRAPHSIGNAL_DEBUG=1` output, and the relevant slice of the `/signals` payload. **Redact before showing it to the user** — a payload carries command lines, host names and tags, which may hold model paths or internal identifiers.

Then give the user the report and the two ways to send it:

- email `support@graphsignal.com`
- open an issue at https://github.com/graphsignal/graphsignal/issues

Sending it is the user's decision, so present the report and let them choose. If the bug blocks the work, say what you are doing instead — a workaround, or continuing without the affected metric.
