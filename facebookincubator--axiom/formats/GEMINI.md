Guidance for Claude Code when working in the Axiom repository.

## Overview

Axiom provides reusable SQL query processing components compatible with
[Velox](https://github.com/facebookincubator/velox). Licensed under
Apache 2.0.

## Build

```bash
make debug    # debug build
make release  # optimized build
```

## Testing

```bash
make unittest                    # run all tests
cd _build/debug && ctest -j 8   # run all tests in parallel
ctest -R AggregationParserTest   # run tests matching a pattern
```

Test files live in `tests/` subdirectories alongside source. Place new
tests next to related existing tests, not at the end of the file. Group
tests by topic (e.g., place `tryCast` next to `types`, `notBetween` next
to `ifClause` which uses `between`).

Prefer gtest container matchers over individual assertions:

```cpp
// ❌ Avoid - multiple individual assertions
EXPECT_EQ(result.size(), 3);
EXPECT_EQ(result[0], "a");
EXPECT_EQ(result[1], "b");
EXPECT_EQ(result[2], "c");

// ✅ Prefer - single matcher assertion
EXPECT_THAT(result, testing::ElementsAre("a", "b", "c"));
```

Common matchers:
- `ElementsAre(...)` - exact ordered match
- `UnorderedElementsAre(...)` - exact unordered match
- `Contains(...)` - at least one element matches
- `IsEmpty()` - collection is empty
- `SizeIs(n)` - collection has n elements

Requires `#include <gmock/gmock.h>`.

### Verifying bug fixes

When fixing a bug, write the test **first** and confirm it reproduces the issue before applying the fix. If the test was written after the fix, temporarily revert the fix and verify the test fails without it. A test that passes with and without the fix proves nothing.

### Verifying changes empirically

Do not rely solely on static code analysis (reading code and reasoning about behavior). Always verify changes by running the code:
- Add temporary print statements to confirm the code path is exercised.
- Write a small test to observe actual behavior.
- Remove debug logging before committing.

## Formatting

```bash
make format  # format all changed files
```

## Coding Style

Axiom follows the Velox coding style. See
[CODING_STYLE.md](https://github.com/facebookincubator/velox/blob/main/CODING_STYLE.md)
for the complete guide. Key rules are summarized below.

### Comments

- Use `///` for public API documentation (classes, public methods, public members).
- Use `//` for private/protected members and comments inside code blocks.
- Start comments with active verbs, not "This class…" or "This method…".
  - ❌ `/// This class builds query plans.`
  - ✅ `/// Builds query plans.`
- Comments should be full English sentences starting with a capital letter and ending with a period.
- Comment every class, every non-trivial method, every member variable.
- Do not restate the variable name. Either explain the semantic meaning or omit the comment.
  - ❌ `// A simple counter.` above `size_t count_{0};`
- Avoid redundant comments that repeat what the code already says. Comments should explain *why*, not *what*.
- Use `// TODO: Description.` for future work. Do not include author's username.
- Do not duplicate comments between `.h` and `.cpp`. Document the function in the header; the implementation should not repeat the same comment. Duplicated comments diverge over time.
- Don't leave reasoning-scaffolding comments in committed code. Comments that capture the thought process — naming a sibling function, citing an example from a design discussion ("e.g. for COUNT-style aggregates"), framing the code defensively against an alternative path that was considered and rejected — are useful working notes while writing but rot quickly: they couple to other functions' internals and to ephemeral conversation context that a fresh reader doesn't share. Before committing, delete any comment that names another function and contrasts it ("X does Y; we do Z"), cites a specific operator/aggregate from discussion, describes a path you didn't take, or reads as a running narrative. Keep only comments that describe an invariant the code maintains or a non-obvious constraint a reader must know.
- After trimming, re-read the function as a fresh reader and check the *other* failure mode: stripping every comment can leave branches whose intent is no longer visible. A silent `else` to a non-trivial `if/else-if` chain, a state mutation whose justification depends on a downstream call, a deliberate-looking "do nothing" — these usually need a one-line `// why` even after every scaffolding comment is gone. Brevity is not "zero comments"; it is "no comment that doesn't earn its line."

#### Public class docs — readability

The above rules are mechanical (form). Class-level documentation has an
additional readability requirement, since header docs are read cold by
people who don't know the surrounding design.

**For non-trivial classes** — defined as ANY of:
- Has multi-state behavior (an enum field, mode flag, or `kind` tag the implementation dispatches on)
- Carries invariants beyond defaults (constructor assertions, ordering requirements, lifecycle rules)
- Participates in a larger protocol or algorithm with other classes
- Is a factory / builder / registry / context object callers compose

— the class-level doc MUST include:
- **(a)** ONE sentence stating what the class is (lead, not buried)
- **(b)** ONE concrete usage example (typically a snippet showing construction + the most common operation, OR a sketch of how it slots into the larger algorithm)
- **(c)** IF the class has invariants: a checklist at the end mirroring what the constructor asserts

**For trivial classes** (pure data carriers with self-explanatory fields,
single-method helpers whose method name conveys purpose, typedef-style
aliases, simple enums): ONE sentence stating what it is. No example or
invariants checklist required.

**When in doubt:** would a reader who hasn't seen the rest of the file
get stuck before reaching the second paragraph? If yes, the class is
non-trivial.

**Failure modes the mechanical rules don't catch** (apply
would-I-say-this-aloud test to each):
- Per-kind / per-mode behavior described as prose instead of a scannable list — readers can't compare cases at a glance.
- Invariants buried in narrative ("if X is set then Y must also be set, except when Z, in which case W") — restate as a checklist.
- Jargon used without definition ("dependent join", "universal", "DT-form") — define inline at first use or replace with plain terms.
- Modeling-rationale fine-print (why the field is split into N components) added without a one-line summary of what the field IS — give the "what" before the "why."
- Edit accretion: a doc that started small and grew through edits without restructuring. Periodically re-read public docs cold and refactor if they no longer read as one piece.

### Naming Conventions

- **PascalCase** for types and file names.
- **camelCase** for functions, member and local variables.
- **camelCase_** for private and protected member variables.
- **snake_case** for namespace names and build targets.
- **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for macros.
- **kPascalCase** for static constants and enumerators.
- Do not abbreviate. Use full, descriptive names. Well-established abbreviations (`id`, `url`, `sql`, `expr`) are acceptable.
- Prefer `numXxx` over `xxxCount` (e.g. `numRows`, `numKeys`).
- Never name a file or class `*Utils`, `*Helpers`, or `*Common`. These generic
  names attract unrelated functions over time and lose cohesion. Name files and
  classes after the concept they represent. Use a class with static methods to
  group related operations, and shorten method names since the class name
  provides context.
- Type aliases defined elsewhere (e.g., `ExprCP`, `ColumnCP`) should be used as-is.

### Asserts and CHECKs

- Use `VELOX_CHECK_*` for internal errors, `VELOX_USER_CHECK_*` for user errors.
- Prefer two-argument forms: `VELOX_CHECK_LT(idx, size)` over `VELOX_CHECK(idx < size)`.
- Use `VELOX_FAIL()` / `VELOX_USER_FAIL()` to throw unconditionally.
- Use `VELOX_UNREACHABLE()` for impossible branches, `VELOX_NYI()` for unimplemented paths.
- Put runtime information (names, values, types) at the **end** of error messages, after the static description.
  - ❌ `VELOX_USER_FAIL("Column '{}' is ambiguous", name);`
  - ✅ `VELOX_USER_FAIL("Column is ambiguous: {}", name);`
- Use precise terminology when describing errors:
  - **crash**: unrecoverable error — segfault, `VELOX_UNREACHABLE()`, abort, or similar.
  - **fail**: controlled error — `VELOX_CHECK`, `VELOX_USER_CHECK`, thrown exception, or returned error code.
  - Do not use "crash" when the code throws a catchable exception.

### Variables

- Prefer value types, then `std::optional`, then `std::unique_ptr`.
- Prefer `std::string_view` over `const std::string&` for function parameters.
- Use uniform initialization: `size_t size{0}` over `size_t size = 0`.
- Declare variables in the smallest scope, as close to usage as possible.
- Use digit separators (`'`) for numeric literals with 4 or more digits: `10'000`, not `10000`.
- Use trailing commas in multi-line initializer lists and enum definitions.
  This produces cleaner diffs when items are added or reordered.

### API Design

- Keep the public API surface small.
- Prefer free functions in `.cpp` (anonymous namespace) over private/static methods declared in the header. The goal is keeping the header small: fewer things in the header means the header changes less often, so fewer downstream translation units recompile. Private members of a file-local class defined entirely in the `.cpp` already satisfy this — the rule doesn't apply to them.
- Define free functions close to where they are used, not grouped together at the top or bottom of the file.
- Keep method implementations in `.cpp` except for trivial one-liners.
- Avoid default arguments when all callers can pass values explicitly.
- Never use `friend`, `FRIEND_TEST`, or any friend declarations. If a test needs access to private members, redesign the API or test through public methods instead.

## Commit Messages

Draft commit messages with the `write-commit-message` skill
(`.claude/skills/write-commit-message/`), which applies these rules.

Use conventional commit prefixes with `[Project]` tags:

```
[Axiom] feat(optimizer): Add support for window functions
[Axiom] fix: Validate HAVING column references in SQL parser
[Axiom] refactor(parser): Extract GroupByPlanner class
```

Format: `[Project] type(scope): Description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`
- Scope is optional, use for subsystem clarity (e.g., `parser`, `optimizer`)
- Description starts with a capital letter, no trailing period

### Body length and shape

A reviewer should be able to read the message in ~30 seconds and walk away knowing what behavior changed, why, and what is deliberately not done. Aim for the title plus 3-5 short paragraphs:

1. **What changed and why** — one paragraph, with one example query or one before/after fact.
2. **Mechanism** — one paragraph, the core idea (a new field, a rewrite step, a swapped algorithm). Not a function-by-function walkthrough; the diff is the source of truth.
3. **Deferred / known limitations** — one short paragraph; name the case and how it surfaces (NYI message, commented-out test, follow-up task). Do not re-explain the design rationale for each deferral.
4. **Test plan** — the test strategy, and only when it is non-obvious (a manual repro, a CLI run, a fuzzer run). The tests are in the diff — don't list them. Otherwise omit the Test Plan. Don't write "tests pass" — CI reports that.

Avoid the reasoning journey: which sibling function got reused, which alternative paths were considered, which Layer-1 fix enabled which Layer-2 fix. That belongs in the design doc or PR thread, not the commit message. If a section keeps growing past a paragraph, it's usually a hint that the change should be split.

References to issue trackers (GitHub issue numbers, internal task IDs) belong in dedicated metadata fields where your VCS / review tool supports them, not in the summary body. References that don't resolve for an external reader read as noise.

## Common Mistakes

These are frequently violated rules. Check every new or modified line against
this list before finishing.

### Bug fixes without a failing test first

When fixing a bug, write the test **first**, run it, and confirm it **fails**
before applying the fix. Then apply the fix and confirm the test passes. If you
wrote the test after the fix, temporarily revert the fix and verify the test
fails. A test that passes both with and without the fix proves nothing. This is
the single most important workflow rule for bug fixes.

### `///` vs `//` — wrong comment style

`///` is **only** for public API: public classes, public methods, public member
variables. Everything else uses `//`: private/protected members, anonymous
namespace functions and types, comments inside function bodies.

```cpp
// ❌ Wrong — anonymous-namespace function is not public API.
namespace {
/// Returns true if 'a' is a prefix of 'b'.
bool isPrefix(const ExprVector& a, const ExprVector& b);
} // namespace

// ✅ Correct.
namespace {
// Returns true if 'a' is a prefix of 'b'.
bool isPrefix(const ExprVector& a, const ExprVector& b);
} // namespace
```

### Generic file and class names (`*Utils`, `*Helpers`, `*Common`)

Never name a file or class `*Utils`, `*Helpers`, or `*Common`. These generic
names attract unrelated functions over time and lose cohesion. Instead, name
files and classes after the concept they represent.

When extracting shared functions, ask: "What do these functions have in common
beyond being useful?" The answer is the name. Use a class with static methods
to group related operations, and shorten method names since the class name
provides context.

```cpp
// ❌ Wrong — generic name, will attract unrelated functions.
class ParserUtils {
  static std::vector<size_t> widenProjectionsForSort(...);
  static void sortAndTrimProjections(...);
};

// ✅ Correct — named after the concept (sorting + projections).
class SortProjection {
  static std::vector<size_t> widenProjections(...);
  static void sortAndTrim(...);
};
```

### One-letter and abbreviated variable names

Do not abbreviate. Use full, descriptive names. Loop indices (`i`, `j`) and
standard iterator/comparison names (`it`, `lhs`, `rhs`) are
acceptable. Everything else — function parameters, lambda parameters, local
variables — must be descriptive.

```cpp
// ❌ Wrong — one-letter names and abbreviations.
bool sameKeys(const ExprVector& a, const ExprVector& b);
std::sort(groups.begin(), groups.end(), [](const auto& a, const auto& b) { ... });
auto f = [](WindowFunctionCP f) { return f->frame().type == WindowType::kRows; };

// ✅ Correct — descriptive names.
bool sameKeys(const ExprVector& lhs, const ExprVector& rhs);
std::sort(groups.begin(), groups.end(), [](const auto& lhs, const auto& rhs) { ... });
auto f = [](WindowFunctionCP func) { return func->frame().type == WindowType::kRows; };
```

### Undocumented APIs in headers

Every class, every non-trivial method declaration, and every member variable in
a `.h` file must have a comment. Trivial one-liner getters may be left
undocumented if the name is self-explanatory.

```cpp
// ❌ Wrong — no comment on method declaration.
  ExprCP translateWindowExpr(const logical_plan::WindowExpr* window);

// ✅ Correct.
  // Translates a logical WindowExpr to a QueryGraph WindowFunction.
  ExprCP translateWindowExpr(const logical_plan::WindowExpr* window);
```

### Non-trivial implementations in headers

Keep method implementations in `.cpp` except for trivial one-liners. If a
method body has more than one statement, it belongs in the `.cpp` file.

```cpp
// ❌ Wrong — multi-statement body in header.
  const WindowPlan* withFunctions(
      const QGVector<WindowFunctionCP>& functions,
      const ColumnVector& columns) const {
    auto merged = functions_;
    merged.insert(merged.end(), functions.begin(), functions.end());
    return make<WindowPlan>(std::move(merged), columns_);
  }

// ✅ Correct — declaration only in header, implementation in .cpp.
  const WindowPlan* withFunctions(
      const QGVector<WindowFunctionCP>& functions,
      const ColumnVector& columns) const;
```

### `goto` statements

Never use `goto`. Restructure the code using early returns, helper functions, or
duplicated code paths instead. `goto` makes control flow hard to follow and is
never necessary in C++.

### Fitting tests to buggy code

When a test fails, **never** update the test expectation to match what the code
produces without first verifying that the code is correct. The default
assumption should be that the code is wrong, not the test.

For optimizer plan tests:
1. Derive the expected plan from query semantics before running the test.
2. When a test fails, investigate the mismatch — do not blindly copy the actual
   output into the expected.
3. Flag suspicious patterns: redundant operators, two gathers with no partition
   keys, extra columns flowing through unnecessary nodes.

### Static analysis instead of CLI experiments

When working on the optimizer, do not spend time reading code and manually
tracing through logic to predict output (cardinalities, plans, column indices).
Instead, run a quick CLI experiment:

```bash
buck run axiom/cli:cli -- --num_workers 1 --num_drivers 1 \
  --query "EXPLAIN (type optimized) SELECT ..."
```

Use `--init` with the test connector to create tables with specific data:

```sql
use test.default;
create table t as select * from unnest(sequence(1, 100)) as t(a);
```

A 10-second CLI run is more reliable than 10 minutes of static analysis.

### Silently simplifying an approved plan

Never silently simplify or skip parts of an approved implementation plan. If a
step turns out to be harder than expected, or you want to defer it, say so
explicitly and get approval before proceeding with a reduced scope. Reporting
"done" when a key piece was dropped is worse than asking for help.

### Working around infrastructure bugs

When you discover a bug in test infrastructure, shared helpers, or common
utilities, do **not** silently work around it. Stop, report the finding, and
discuss whether to fix the root cause or work around it. Workarounds accumulate
into technical debt and mask real problems.

### Leaving incremental scaffolding in the final code

Before declaring a multi-step change done, re-read the modified files as a
fresh reader and remove scaffolding from the editing process: dead
variables/helpers/fields, stale comments describing an earlier version of
the code, defensive checks that no longer guard anything, organization
reflecting edit order, and naming inherited from prior iterations. Refactor
as if you were writing the final form from scratch — the reader has only
the code, not your editing history.

### Verify causation before asserting it

When investigating a test failure or regression, do not attribute it to a
specific commit based on the commit message alone. Verify empirically by
checking out the parent commit and running the test. Incorrect attribution
leads to wrong fixes — e.g., updating test expectations when the real problem
is a bug introduced by a different commit.

## Axiom-Specific Patterns

### Dialect Independence

- Only the SQL parser is dialect-specific. The logical plan, optimizer,
  PlanBuilder, and runner are dialect-agnostic — do not introduce
  dialect-specific terms in these layers.
