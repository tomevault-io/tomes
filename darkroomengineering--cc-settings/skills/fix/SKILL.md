# Bug Fix Workflow

Before starting work, create a marker: `mkdir -p ~/.claude/tmp && echo "fix" > ~/.claude/tmp/heavy-skill-active && date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ" >> ~/.claude/tmp/heavy-skill-active`

You are in **Maestro orchestration mode**. Delegate immediately to specialized agents.

## Current State
- Branch: !`git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown"`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -5 2>/dev/null || echo "no commits"`
- Uncommitted changes: !`git status --porcelain 2>/dev/null | head -10`

## Workflow

1. **Explore** - Spawn `explore` agent to understand the affected codebase area
2. **Reproduce** - Spawn `tester` agent to create a failing test if possible
3. **Diagnose** - Analyze findings to identify root cause
4. **Implement** - Spawn `implementer` agent to fix the issue
5. **Verify** - Spawn `tester` agent to confirm the fix
6. **Learn** - If this was a non-obvious fix, auto-invoke `/learn store bug "..."` to remember it

## Scope Rules

Follow CLAUDE.md Guardrails (scope constraint, 2-iteration limit). Only modify files directly related to the bug.

**Build after every fix**: Run the build after each individual fix attempt. Never stack multiple untested fixes -- verify green before moving on. If the build breaks, fix *that* before continuing.

## Agent Delegation

```
Agent(explore, "Investigate the bug: $ARGUMENTS. Find relevant files, trace the issue.")
Agent(tester, "Create a failing test that reproduces: $ARGUMENTS")
Agent(implementer, "Fix the bug based on findings: [summary from explore] SCOPE: Only modify files identified in exploration. Do NOT refactor adjacent code. Run the build after each fix to verify.")
Agent(reviewer, "Quick review of the fix for quality and edge cases")
```

## Output

Return a concise summary:
- **Root cause**: What was wrong
- **Fix applied**: What changed
- **Files modified**: List of files
- **Verification**: How it was tested
- **Learning stored**: If applicable

## Remember

- If the fix involves a library API, **fetch docs first** via `/docs <library>` — APIs change between versions
- Always store non-obvious bug fixes as learnings
- Check if similar bugs were fixed before (recall learnings)
- Run tests after fixing
