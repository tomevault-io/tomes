# Adding a language

1. **Locale file.** Copy `src/localization/locales/en.json` to
   `src/localization/locales/{code}.json` (`fr`, `es`, `pl`, ...) and translate
   the values. Keep every key: a missing key falls back to English silently,
   which reads as a half-translated UI.
2. **Register it.** In `src/localization/i18n.ts`, import the file and add it to
   the `resources` object.
3. **List it.** Add the entry to `src/localization/languages.json` — the settings
   dropdown and the supported-language check in `i18n.ts` both read from it.
4. **README.** Update the language list in [README.md](../../../README.md).
5. **Changelog.** Bullet under `## [Unreleased]` in CHANGELOG.md.

## Check the keys match

```bash
node -e "const a=require('./src/localization/locales/en.json'),b=require('./src/localization/locales/{code}.json');const ka=Object.keys(a),kb=Object.keys(b);console.log('missing:',ka.filter(k=>!kb.includes(k)));console.log('extra:',kb.filter(k=>!ka.includes(k)))"
```

Both lists must be empty.

## What the translation layer supports

`src/localization/i18n.ts` is an in-repo ~1 KB replacement for i18next, not
i18next itself. It handles dot-path keys, `{{name}}` interpolation, and an
English fallback — and nothing else. **Plurals (`key_one` / `key_other`), key
nesting (`$t(...)`), contexts and namespaces are not implemented**: a locale
using them renders the raw template. Phrase the translation to avoid them, or
bring i18next back rather than growing that file.

Keys resolve in two shapes, because the locale files use both: a literal
top-level key containing dots (`"support.header": "..."`) and a nested object
(`"monthsShort": { "January": "..." }`). Either works; don't "normalise" one
into the other without checking the call sites.

`src/localization/__tests__/keyCoverage.spec.ts` asserts that every literal
`t("...")` call site in `src` resolves to a real string. If it fails, a key was
renamed in the code but not in `en.json` (or vice versa). Note that tests which
mock `i18n.t` as an identity function cannot catch this — don't assert on the
key name in those.

## Look at it

```bash
npm run harness
```

Set `language` in `harnessSettings` (`harness/fixtures.ts`) to the new code and
check that nothing overflows its container — translated strings are routinely
longer than the English ones, and the header and footer are tight.

## Finish

```bash
npm run verify
```
