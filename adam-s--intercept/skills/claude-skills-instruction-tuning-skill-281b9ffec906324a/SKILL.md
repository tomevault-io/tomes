# Instruction Tuning via Sub-Agent Testing

## ⚠️💣 MANDATORY CONSENT CHECK — Read Before Proceeding 💣⚠️

**Before doing ANYTHING, check if `.claude/user-consent.md` exists and contains `ACCEPTED: true`.**

If the file exists and has `ACCEPTED: true`, display:
```
✅ Prior consent on file (DATE). Proceeding. Review .claude/user-consent.md to revoke.
```
Then skip to "Before Starting — Ask the User".

**If the file does NOT exist or does not contain `ACCEPTED: true`, you MUST present these 3 warnings and get explicit "yes" to each before proceeding:**

**If ALL THREE answers are "yes"**, write `.claude/user-consent.md` (gitignored):
```markdown

WARNINGS_ACKNOWLEDGED: tos, autonomous-agents, resource-consumption
```

**If ANY answer is "no"**, STOP. Do not proceed. Tell the user what they declined.

## How This Works

You are not writing code. You are writing instructions that make other agents write correct code.

1. **Launch sub-agents** on real websites and watch their behavior in real time.
2. **Ask yourself: "Would I do it this way?"** Compare the agent's approach to how you would solve the problem. When the agent makes a choice you wouldn't make — navigates to the wrong page, extracts data instead of interacting, gives up after one try — that's an instruction gap.
3. **Fix the instructions so the agent would do what you would do.** The `.claude/` files are the only lever. You can't hint, coach, or correct the agent mid-run. The instructions must be clear enough that a fresh agent, reading them for the first time, makes the same choices you would make.
4. **Re-run and verify.** Launch fresh agents on the same sites. If they still diverge from your approach, the instructions are still wrong — find the gap and fix it again.

The sub-agent's code is throwaway. The instruction improvements are the product. Every iteration should close the gap between "what the agent does" and "what you would do."

## Before Starting — Ask the User

**Turn 1:** Ask how many passes — 1 or 2? Default to 1.
- **1 pass:** Full breadth discovery. Find all transports, build routes.
- **2 passes:** Pass 1 = breadth discovery. Pass 2 = focused deep dive on transports pass 1 missed (WebSocket, streaming, session harvest). Seed pass 2 prompts with pass 1 findings.

**Turn 2:** Ask which websites to test. The user picks the sites. Assign ports starting at 3011. Max 8 per batch.

**Turn 3:** Ask what to do when agents finish. Pick one:
- **A) Full cleanup** (default) — kill processes, delete worktrees, revert shared files. Clean slate for next iteration.
- **B) Keep worktrees** — kill processes but preserve worktree directories. Use this when worktrees will be reused (e.g., for dashboard tuning pass 2).
- **C) Keep agents alive** — don't stop running agents. Use this when you want to continue or redirect agents mid-run.
- **D) Keep both** — preserve worktrees AND keep agents alive. Use this for multi-pass runs where pass 2 agents need pass 1 worktrees and some agents are still running.

Do NOT launch agents until the user answers all questions.

## The Loop

```
1. Clean: bash .claude/hooks/cleanup-agents.sh
2. Verify commit: ensure worktrees will branch from the latest committed instructions
3. Launch sub-agents with worktree isolation (run_in_background: true)
4. LIVE MONITOR every 60 seconds (see Live Monitoring below)
5. Stop agents when you have enough data or they're stuck
6. Inspect: did they follow the pipeline? Full elimination table?
7. Diagnose: which instruction was too soft, missing, or contradictory?
8. Fix the instruction (generalized, not site-specific)
9. CONSISTENCY CHECK — before committing, search ALL .claude/ files for contradictions:
   - Grep for the concept you changed (pagination, testing, session harvest, etc.)
   - Verify every mention says the same thing across rules/, agents/, skills/
   - Fix any file that contradicts or uses softer language than your change
10. PRUNE .claude/ — delete redundant lines, reduce noise, keep instructions tight. Shorter files are followed better. If a rule can be said in 1 line instead of 3, use 1 line.
11. PROCESS CLEANUP — kill all zombie processes before and after every iteration:
    ```bash
    bash .claude/hooks/cleanup-agents.sh
    ```
12. FIX INFRASTRUCTURE — if agents waste calls on browser crashes, server restarts, package linking, or port conflicts, fix the underlying infrastructure not just the instructions.
13. BUILD UTILITIES — if agents repeat the same multi-step operation, create a script or endpoint that does it in one call.
14. Add any new patterns to test-server + boardshop reference routes
15. Commit fixes (ensure worktrees will get them on next iteration)
16. Write handoff doc (.claude/tuning-handoff.md) — gitignored, not committed
17. Start fresh Claude Code session to clear stale context, repeat
```

## Consistency Check (Step 7)

When you change an instruction, the same concept appears in multiple files. A fix in `discovery.md` means nothing if `discovery-agent.md` or a SKILL.md still uses the old soft language.

**Before committing any instruction change, search all .claude/ for the concept:**

```bash
# Example: if you tightened pagination language
grep -rn "pagina\|totalCount\|hasMore\|complete" .claude/rules/ .claude/agents/ .claude/skills/
```

Every hit must be consistent with your change. Files to check:
- `.claude/rules/discovery.md` — the protocol (agents read this)
- `.claude/agents/discovery-agent.md` — agent instructions (agents inherit this)
- `.claude/skills/instruction-tuning/SKILL.md` — prompt template + scorecard (you control this)
- `.claude/skills/api-discovery/SKILL.md` — discovery skill entry point
- `.claude/skills/api-discovery/reference/*.md` — reference files agents may read
- `.claude/skills/app/SKILL.md` — app builder that launches discovery agents
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — top-level project instructions

A single soft "check for" in any file undoes a hard "MUST" in another.

## Live Monitoring (Step 4)

Do NOT wait for agents to complete. Monitor every 60 seconds by reading their output JSONL files:

```bash
FILE="/Users/...subagents/agent-XXXX.jsonl"
cat "$FILE" | python3 -c "
import sys, json
for line in sys.stdin:
    try:
        d = json.loads(line)
        if d.get('type') == 'assistant':
            for c in d.get('message',{}).get('content',[]):
                if isinstance(c,dict):
                    if c.get('type')=='text' and len(c.get('text',''))>20:
                        print('TEXT:',c['text'][:400]); print('---')
                    elif c.get('type')=='tool_use':
                        n=c.get('name','');inp=c.get('input',{})
                        if n=='Bash': print(f'BASH: {inp.get(\"command\",\"\")[:140]}')
                        elif n in('Read','Write','Edit'): print(f'{n}: ...{inp.get(\"file_path\",\"\")[-55:]}')
                        else: print(f'{n}')
    except: pass
" | tail -25
```

**At each check, write a brief analysis:**

| Agent | Calls | Phase | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| SH | ~35 | GATHER | Found XHR POST, navigating to event page |
| TM | ~40 | GATHER | Clicked "Show More", 0 new traffic — not testing ?page=2 |

**For each agent, ask:** "What would I do differently right now?"
- If the agent is wasting calls on something you wouldn't do, that's an instruction gap
- If it's stuck in a pattern you've seen before, note the specific failure for the fix phase
- If it's doing something smart that isn't in the instructions, note it for addition

**When to stop early:** If an agent is burning calls on the same pattern that failed in prior iterations (e.g., re-clicking "Show More" with 0 new traffic, trying curl /browser/fetch), stop it. You already know the failure — fix the instruction instead of watching it fail again.

**Guided agents:** When you identify a specific failure, launch a targeted agent with explicit instructions about what to do differently. Compare the guided agent's path to the unguided one — the delta reveals what the instructions are missing.

## Cleanup Before EVERY Iteration

```bash
bash .claude/hooks/cleanup-agents.sh
```

Kills all agent processes, removes all worktrees, cleans untracked domains, reverts contaminated shared files.

## Stale Context Problem

Subagents inherit the parent session's system-reminder context, which may contain OLD file contents from deleted/modified rules files. This causes agents to reference files that no longer exist.

**Fix: start a fresh Claude Code session before each iteration batch.** Write a handoff doc so the new session can pick up where you left off.

## Session Handoff

After committing all fixes, write `.claude/tuning-handoff.md` (gitignored) with:

1. **Iteration number** — which iteration completed and what's next
2. **Results table** — tokens, time, routes, elimination status per agent
3. **Test sites and ports** — domain names are OK here (file is temporary, gitignored)
4. **Known issues** — what's still broken
5. **What changed** — commits made during this session
6. **What's next** — specific items for the next iteration

The new session reads this file to pick up context. Subagents get clean system-reminders because the fresh session reads `.claude/` files from disk.

## Parallel Testing

Launch agents with worktree isolation. Each gets a unique port (3010 + N). **Concurrency limit: 8 agents max.** Beyond 8, browser instances compete for resources and connections drop. If you need more sites, run in batches of 8.

Agent prompt template:
```
Discover ALL transport types that [site] uses. Build a route for EVERY transport found.
Target: [url]
Follow .claude/rules/discovery.md — GATHER→SCAN→CLASSIFY→BUILD.
In GATHER: connect to HOMEPAGE first and browse naturally (scroll, click) to warm up cookies before navigating to target pages. Intercept pagination traffic. If you see an API endpoint with pagination params (e.g., ?page=1) in traffic, test it directly via page.evaluate("fetch('/api/path?page=2', {credentials:'include'}).then(r=>r.json())..."). For cross-origin APIs, credentials:'include' forwards browser cookies. Use page.evaluate for interaction and fetch() testing — do NOT read __NEXT_DATA__ or DOM data during GATHER. browserFetch is NOT an HTTP endpoint — use page.evaluate("fetch(...)") during discovery.
In CLASSIFY: name the site's core data and verify your transports cover it.
In BUILD: auth-gated endpoints (Gap=Y) go directly to session harvest. Read the session harvest reference file BEFORE writing any harvest code.
In BUILD: after each route, fill the mandatory completeness check. If totalCount > items returned, the route is NOT DONE — paginate before moving to the next route.
Fill ALL 8 elimination rows before writing code.
After building routes, register your domain and test EVERY route through the API server proxy.
Before finishing: run `pnpm biome check --write --unsafe .` and fix any remaining lint or type errors. CI must be clean — you are responsible for leaving the worktree in a buildable state.
Budget: ~150 tool calls. Plan: ~30 GATHER, ~10 SCAN/CLASSIFY, ~80 BUILD, ~30 testing. Do not retry failed requests — unexpected output is information, not failure.
Your port is XXXX.
```

## Scorecard

| Check | Pass/Fail |
|-------|-----------|
| Browser connected to HOMEPAGE first, warmed up before deep navigation | |
| Pagination intercepted in GATHER (new traffic captured OR discovered endpoint confirmed via browser fetch()) | |
| 2a-CHECK: traffic scanned for pagination params, page 2 tested if found | |
| page.evaluate used for interaction + fetch() testing only in GATHER (not for reading __NEXT_DATA__ or DOM data) | |
| Used {credentials:"include"} for cross-origin fetch() calls | |
| Used /browser/mcp/fetch for discovery-phase API testing (not page.evaluate) | |
| Full elimination table (all 8 rows ✓ or ✗) | |
| Route built for EVERY ✓ transport | |
| Used GATHER→SCAN→CLASSIFY→BUILD pipeline | |
| Did NOT search for public APIs | |
| Detail page visited in browser (URL recorded) | |
| Access Gap table produced (Step 2e) | |
| Core data identified in CLASSIFY | |
| Session harvest COMPLETED for Gap=Y endpoints (routes return data, not errors) | |
| Pagination COMPLETE: every route's completeness check shows total == items returned | |
| Routes tested through API server proxy AND return real data (not empty/error) | |
| Wrote files to worktree, not main repo | |
| Stayed under 150 tool calls | |

## Crash / Retry / Regression Policy

**On crash:** Check the error message. If it's a fixable infrastructure issue (binary data in traffic, missing dependency, port conflict), apply the code fix and re-launch that single agent. If it's an API-level error (Claude "Could not process image"), check that static resource blocking is working and re-launch.

**On timeout (>20 min):** Kill the agent. Check if it's stuck in a retry loop (429s, WAF challenges, sleep). If so, fix the instruction that allowed the loop and re-launch.

**On success but regression:** Compare route count and transport coverage to the previous iteration. If an agent found fewer transports, check:
- Did it skip browser traffic capture? (Steps 1d/1e)
- Did it hit the tool budget before finishing?
- Did it test through the proxy or just curl directly?

Flag regressions in the handoff doc. Do not accept fewer transports without explanation.

## Deep Analysis (after each iteration)

For each agent, analyze:
- Tool call breakdown: how many in GATHER vs SCAN vs CLASSIFY vs BUILD?
- Infrastructure waste: pnpm install, sleep, server retries
- Did the agent follow the pipeline in order or interleave?
- What new patterns did it discover not in test-server/boardshop?
- Where did it waste the most tool calls?

Add any new patterns to test-server endpoints + boardshop reference routes before the next iteration.

## Generalization Rule

Every instruction change must work for ANY website. If a fix only helps for a specific site, it's overfitting. Never put specific website names, URLs, or transport classifications in instruction files (test-server, boardshop, and CLAUDE.md are the only places for working code examples).

## Convergence

The loop converges when fresh agents (clean session, no hints):
1. Follow the GATHER→SCAN→CLASSIFY→BUILD pipeline
2. Fill all 8 elimination rows before writing code
3. Build routes for every ✓ transport (including WebSocket, HLS, encoded)
4. Validate each route through the API server proxy — returns real data, not empty/error
5. Capture browser traffic (Steps 1d/1e) including detail page visit
6. Complete session harvest for all Gap=Y endpoints (routes return data)
7. Complete pagination for all routes (completeness check: total == items returned)
8. Stay near 150 tool calls (data completeness takes priority over budget)
9. Write all files to worktree, not main repo
