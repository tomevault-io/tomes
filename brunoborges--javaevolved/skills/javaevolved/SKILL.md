# Modern Java

Determine the project's effective compilation target before proposing code.
An installed JDK is only fallback evidence; it does not prove which language
features or APIs the build accepts.

## Workflow

1. From the project or module root, run:

   On macOS or Linux:

   ```bash
   <skill-directory>/scripts/detect-java-version.sh .
   ```

   On Windows:

   ```bat
   <skill-directory>\scripts\detect-java-version.cmd .
   ```

   If the user explicitly supplied Java version X, pass
   `--java-version X`. Explicit user intent takes precedence over project files.

2. Read the JSON result:
   - Use `selected.version` as the target.
   - Treat `maven-release`, `gradle-release`, and explicit overrides as stronger
     evidence than toolchains, source compatibility, version-manager files, CI,
     environment variables, or the installed runtime.
   - If `ambiguous` is true, inspect the listed files and determine which module
     or build profile is in scope. Do not silently choose the newest version.
   - If no version is selected, inspect build and CI configuration. If still
     unknown, state the assumption before writing version-sensitive code.

3. Read [core practices](references/core-practices.md), then read the target
   release and all earlier applicable groups in
   [release practices](references/release-practices.md). Recommendations are
   cumulative: Java 21 code may use final features from Java 21 and below.
   When Jakarta EE, MicroProfile, Spring, JPA, JDBC, jOOQ, JSF, JAX-RS, JMS,
   EJB, or CDI is in scope, also read
   [enterprise practices](references/enterprise-practices.md). Framework
   versions are a separate compatibility axis from the Java target.

4. Inspect whether preview is explicitly enabled (`--enable-preview` in both
   compile and runtime/test configuration). Do not recommend preview features
   by default. Never use a feature finalized after the detected target.

5. Tailor the work:
   - **New code:** prefer the clearest final API available at the target.
   - **Review:** flag needless legacy patterns only when the replacement is
     available at the target and fits the behavior.
   - **Modernization:** separate behavior-preserving refactors from Java target
     upgrades. Do not raise the target unless requested.
   - **Libraries:** respect the published minimum Java version, not the
     maintainer's local JDK.
   - **Multi-release or multi-module builds:** evaluate each affected source set
     or module against its own target.
   - **Framework migrations:** verify the framework/runtime version, namespace
     (`javax.*` versus `jakarta.*`), deployment model, and operational semantics.
     Do not infer framework capability from the Java target alone.

6. Validate with the project's existing build using its configured toolchain.
   Compile and run tests with the same `--release` and preview settings used by
   production. Do not treat a successful compile on a newer local JDK as proof
   of compatibility.

## Recommendation format

When version matters, briefly name the basis:

> Detected Java 17 from `maven.compiler.release`; recommendations are limited to
> final Java 17 APIs and language features.

For upgrades, distinguish:

- **Usable now:** supported by the current target.
- **Available after upgrade:** requires a specific newer target.
- **Preview:** experimental for a specific release and opt-in only.

Prefer small, behavior-preserving changes. Do not mechanically replace every
older construct: readability, API contracts, allocation behavior, framework
constraints, and team conventions still apply.
