description: Configure hotpath profiling in a Rust project. Adds the hotpath dependency with feature-gated setup, instruments main with hotpath::main, functions with measure/measure_all, and wraps channels, mutexes, rw_locks, streams and futures with hotpath macros. Use when the user wants to add or set up hotpath profiling in a crate. Use when this capability is needed.

# Initialize hotpath Profiling

Set up [hotpath](https://hotpath.rs) profiling in the current Rust project. The setup is fully feature-gated: zero compile-time and runtime overhead unless the `hotpath` feature is explicitly enabled. All macros are noops when the feature is off, so no `cfg_attr` wrapping is needed.

## Steps

### 1. Inspect the project

- Find the binary crate(s) and the `main` function. If there is no `main` you control (e.g. a library or a test harness), use the `HotpathGuardBuilder` API instead of `#[hotpath::main]` (see step 3).
- Detect the async runtime (`tokio`, `smol`, none) and which instrumentable primitives the code uses: channels (`tokio::sync::mpsc`/`oneshot`, `std::sync::mpsc`, `crossbeam_channel`, `flume`, `async-channel`, `futures_channel`), `Mutex` and `RwLock` (std/parking_lot/tokio/async-lock), futures streams, sqlx, diesel.

### 2. Add the dependency and feature passthrough

In the target crate's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
hotpath = "0.21"

[features]
hotpath = ["hotpath/hotpath"]
hotpath-alloc = ["hotpath/hotpath-alloc"]
```

Enable extra hotpath cargo features on the dependency based on what the project uses:

- `tokio` - for `tokio::sync` channel instrumentation and `hotpath::tokio_runtime!()` metrics: `hotpath = { version = "0.21", features = ["tokio"] }`
- `crossbeam` - for `crossbeam_channel` instrumentation
- `futures` - for `futures_channel` instrumentation
- `flume` - for `flume` channel instrumentation
- `async-channel` - for `async-channel` instrumentation
- `parking_lot` - for `parking_lot` `RwLock`/`Mutex` instrumentation
- `async-lock` - for `async-lock` `RwLock`/`Mutex` instrumentation
- `sqlx` - for SQL query profiling via `hotpath::sqlx_tracing_layer()`
- `diesel` - for SQL query profiling via `hotpath::instrument_diesel_sql()`

If the crate already has a `[features]` section, merge the entries.

### 3. Instrument main

`#[hotpath::main]` initializes the profiler and prints the report when main exits. With tokio, `#[tokio::main]` must come FIRST (above):

```rust
#[tokio::main]
#[hotpath::main]
async fn main() {
    // ...
}
```

Optional parameters: `#[hotpath::main(percentiles = [50, 95, 99.9], format = "json", limit = 20)]`. Defaults are fine for a first setup; don't add parameters unless asked.

If attribute placement on main is not possible, build a guard programmatically (report prints when the guard drops):

```rust
let _hotpath = hotpath::HotpathGuardBuilder::new("main")
    .build();
```

### 4. Instrument functions

- Prefer `#[hotpath::measure_all]` on inline modules and `impl` blocks - it instruments every function inside. Exclude noisy or trivial functions with `#[hotpath::skip]`.
- Use `#[hotpath::measure]` on individual functions, both sync and async. 
- Useful parameters: `log = true` (log return values, requires `Debug`), `label = "name"` (custom identifier, duplicates panic at runtime).
- `hotpath::measure_block!("label", { ... })` for ad-hoc code blocks.

Start with hot paths: request handlers, worker loops, parsing/serialization, IO-heavy functions. Don't instrument one-line getters.

Async functions are measured runtime-agnostically, and under `hotpath-alloc` their allocations are tracked too (per-poll attribution via an async bridge), so no special handling is needed.

Don't try to instrument everything, use up to ~5 `hotpath::measure_all` annotations and up to 30 `hotpath::measure`. Goal of the initial setup is not to measure all functions, but to get the initial working instrumentation in place.

### 5. Wrap data-flow primitives

Wrap at the creation site; all wrappers accept optional `label = "name"` and (where noted) `log = true`:

```rust
// Channels (tokio mpsc/oneshot, std mpsc, crossbeam, flume, async-channel, futures_channel)
let (tx, rx) = hotpath::channel!(mpsc::channel::<String>(100), label = "jobs", log = true);
// tokio oneshot + futures_channel need proxy mode (compile error otherwise);
// bounded std sync_channel and futures_channel mpsc also need capacity = N (must match):
let (tx, rx) = hotpath::channel!(mpsc::channel::<String>(10), proxy = true, capacity = 10);

// Locks (wait time + held time)
let mutex = hotpath::mutex!(std::sync::Mutex::new(state), label = "state");
let lock = hotpath::rw_lock!(tokio::sync::RwLock::new(config), label = "config");

// Streams and futures
let s = hotpath::stream!(stream::iter(1..=10), label = "events");
let result = hotpath::future!(some_async_operation(), label = "fetch").await;
```

Wrapped locks/channels are drop-in: the wrappers expose the same API, so call sites don't change. If passing them across function boundaries requires type-signature changes, note that to the user rather than rewriting half the codebase silently.

Wrapper macros return types prefixed with `hotpath::wrap`, make sure to update type signatures where needed. Explain to user that these types are no-op unless `hotpath` feature is enabled.

Apply `log = true` only if `Debug` is already implemented.

### 6. Optional extras (only when relevant)

- Tokio runtime metrics: call `hotpath::tokio_runtime!();` once at startup (requires `tokio` feature).
- SQL profiling (sqlx 0.8/0.9): add the layer to the tracing subscriber once - `tracing_subscriber::registry().with(hotpath::sqlx_tracing_layer()).init();` (requires `sqlx` feature). Don't filter out the `sqlx::query` target.
- SQL profiling (diesel): call `hotpath::instrument_diesel_sql();` once at startup (requires `diesel` feature).

### 7. Verify

```bash
cargo check                       # feature off: must still compile, zero overhead
cargo check --features hotpath    # feature on
cargo run --features hotpath      # prints report on exit
```

Optionally verify alloc mode: `cargo run --features 'hotpath,hotpath-alloc'`.

Report what was instrumented and mention next steps: the live TUI (`cargo install hotpath --features tui`, then `hotpath console` while the app runs - metrics server listens on port 6770 by default), and `HOTPATH_OUTPUT_FORMAT=json` for machine-readable output. Report sections need no configuration: the default `HOTPATH_REPORT=auto` shows function and thread sections plus every instrumented section with data (channels, streams, futures, rw_locks, mutexes, sql, ...). Mention `HOTPATH_REPORT` only if the user wants to restrict output: an exact comma-separated list (e.g. `HOTPATH_REPORT=functions-timing,sql`), `all`, or auto with exclusions like `HOTPATH_REPORT=auto,-threads` / `HOTPATH_REPORT=-threads`.

Also explain to the user that hotpath is safe to keep as a regular (non-optional) dependency: unless the `hotpath` feature is enabled, it compiles zero third-party dependencies (only the hotpath crates themselves), and all macros expand to noops, so there is no compile-time bloat and no runtime overhead.

## Rules

- Never enable the `hotpath` feature by default (`default = []`); profiling must stay opt-in.
- Keep edits minimal: dependency, main, and a sensible starting set of instrumented functions/primitives. Expand coverage only when the user asks.
