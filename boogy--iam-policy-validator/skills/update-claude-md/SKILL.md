# Update CLAUDE.md

Analyze the codebase and generate a hierarchical CLAUDE.md system optimized for Claude Code.

## Key Principles

- CLAUDE.md is **authoritative** — treated as system rules, not suggestions
- Use **modular sections** with clear markdown headers
- **Front-load critical context** — large CLAUDE.md files improve instruction adherence
- **Hierarchical strategy**: Root = universal rules; Subdirs = specific context
- Keep root CLAUDE.md under 400 lines

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Repository Analysis

Analyze and present:

1. **Architecture** — monorepo/standard, tech stack, testing, CI/CD
2. **Claude Code opportunities** — hooks, MCP servers, commands, subagents
3. **Directory map** — where CLAUDE.md files should exist
4. **Dangerous patterns** — commands to block, files to protect
5. **Tool permissions** — defaults vs explicit permission required

Present analysis as a structured map before generating files.

### Phase 2: Generate Root CLAUDE.md

Include these sections (see [references/claude-md-guide.md](references/claude-md-guide.md) for detailed templates):

1. **Project Identity** (5-10 lines) — type, stack, architecture
2. **Universal Rules** (10-20 lines) — MUST/SHOULD/MUST NOT with RFC-2119 language
3. **Core Commands** (10-20 lines) — development, quality, testing
4. **Project Structure Map** (15-30 lines) — with links to subdirectory CLAUDE.md
5. **Quick Find Commands** (10-15 lines) — JIT search patterns
6. **Security & Secrets** (5-10 lines)
7. **Git Workflow** (5-10 lines)
8. **Testing Strategy** (5-10 lines)
9. **Tool Permissions** (5-10 lines)
10. **Subdirectory Context** (5-10 lines) — links to specialized CLAUDE.md

### Phase 3: Generate Subdirectory CLAUDE.md Files

For each major package/directory (100-200 lines each):

1. Package identity and parent context link
2. Setup and commands
3. **Architecture and patterns** (most important)
4. Key files and touch points
5. JIT search hints
6. Common gotchas
7. Package-specific testing
8. Pre-PR validation

### Phase 4: Claude Code Configuration

1. Hooks configuration (`.claude/settings.json`)
2. Custom slash commands (`.claude/commands/`)
3. MCP server recommendations
4. Subagent recommendations (if applicable)

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Root CLAUDE.md under 400 lines
- [ ] All subdirectory CLAUDE.md files link back to root
- [ ] Every "DO" has a real file example with path
- [ ] Every "DON'T" references actual anti-pattern
- [ ] Commands are copy-paste ready
- [ ] JIT search commands use actual file patterns
- [ ] No duplication between hierarchy levels
