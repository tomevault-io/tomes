# course2md desktop design

This is the project's design authority. Use Material 3 for composition, hierarchy, component roles and feedback; use Apple HIG for desktop task context and settings relationships while retaining macOS window, menu and keyboard conventions. The user's current instructions take precedence over this skill. Rejected native screens are evidence of problems, never a template to reproduce or an acceptance result.

## Read the reference that controls the decision

- For every UI change, read [the shared system](references/system.md) and [layout, type and icons](references/layout-and-type.md). Establish the screen's alignment axes and information hierarchy before changing padding.
- For interactions, asynchronous work, scrolling or animation, read [states and motion](references/states-and-motion.md).
- For first use, conversion, navigation or recovery, read [task decisions and continuity](references/interaction.md).
- For preferences, services, models and diagnostics, also read [settings composition](references/settings.md).
- Before a whole-product review, read [composition decisions](references/composition-review.md). Start with the user’s task and information worth showing; a geometrically tidy screen may still need to be rejected.
- For the official basis, read [the source guide](references/material-sources.md), then the relevant downloaded document. It distinguishes official guidance, short M3 quotations, and project choices. Do not describe a project token as an official Material requirement.

The source package contains real offline article text and original Markdown from licensed Google documentation. M3's JavaScript-rendered site was inspected through its published content data; its unverified prose licence permits no claim that this package mirrors complete M3 pages. Short quotations, original URLs, capture dates, source versions, SHA-256 hashes and licence evidence are recorded locally. No empty HTML shell counts as downloaded guidance.

## Product decisions

The task is video → readable note. Source inspection and planning are internal stages, not separate pages requiring routine approval. A usable result opens directly when the person is still following that task; a separate completion page must not stand between the task and the note. Background completion must not steal someone's current location. Ask only for an unresolved user decision or actionable obstacle.

Use a meaningful Material icon plus a visibly emphasized label for the main UI headings, navigation destinations, action labels and preference labels. Use shared label/icon composition rather than hand-positioning each page. Values, metadata, explanatory sentences and long-form note text retain ordinary body typography. Do not attach an icon to every sentence or make an entire form, error paragraph or note bold.

Keep explanation inside the same setting or resource boundary as its subject. Within an existing boundary, use the shared information icon and supporting text without a second full-width frame. Standalone guidance can have its own low-emphasis panel. Essential field labels, the current selection, actionable errors and the consequence of an action remain visible with that action. A tooltip is supplementary help; a modal dialog is a necessary interruption. These are different roles.

Scrollbars respond to scrolling, hover and dragging, then fade after interaction ends, while honoring the existing system preference for always-visible scrollbars. Their appearance must not change content width or move text. See [the scrollbar state contract](references/states-and-motion.md#scrollbars).

Keep choices with their effects. The app detects metadata, reuses established configuration and supplies supported defaults. Explicit source/model/service choices remain authoritative. First use is skippable and revisitable and helps complete a real task; optional services, appearance and diagnostics are not prerequisites for ordinary conversion.

## Implement the shared contract

Colors, type roles, icons, control dimensions, states and motion belong in shared primitives such as `desktop/src/theme.rs`, `choice_group.rs`, `icons.rs`, `motion.rs` and reusable settings rows. Correct the shared implementation and inspect every affected caller. A function is not shared in practice when callers replace its inner padding, font or selected state.

Measure actual text, icon, container and painted state bounds. Parent width and the current 100/125/150/200% text scale determine layout; character-count widths, silent clipping and fixed-height multiline surfaces do not. Reflow before related elements collide. Keep selection under transient pointer feedback and preserve ordinary keyboard operation.

Preserve all palettes, their provenance and separate light/dark selections. Previews use the same semantic color mapping as the app. A failed save keeps a recovery action and must not claim persistence. Do not perform filesystem or network work during rendering.

## Review and finish

For a whole-product UI change, use independent subagents to review every affected page and its loading, empty, failure and completion states, including shared-component callers and overlays. Give reviewers the original rejected screens, current native captures and this skill. Do not give them a list of claimed fixes to rubber-stamp. Record concrete findings and how each was resolved; a previous review does not establish a new pass. A reviewer who implements a region must not be its only final reviewer. The main agent owns the final design judgment, including contradictions between regions.

Follow a fresh task and a repeat task through the running native app to a usable note. Check temporary settings/login navigation, return, retry, cancellation and late responses. Then review complete-screen hierarchy and grouping, followed by ruler alignment, actual line/icon geometry, states and motion. Compilation, tests, screenshot dimensions and a duration constant are not design acceptance.

Verify native normal/narrow/wide windows, light/dark appearance, every offered palette and type scale. Inspect resting, hovered, pressed and keyboard-focused selected controls; active and idle scrolling; entering and settling motion; failure and completion. Distinguish screenshot evidence, source inspection and runtime observation, and state any unvisited cases. The user excluded specialist accessibility audits: preserve ordinary keyboard behavior and existing preferences without creating a separate accessibility project.

Use isolated fixtures for failing saves, generation and destructive flows. Test changed behavior meaningfully, keep atomic Git commits by concern, and finish with candid evidence and a runnable reviewed preview. Do not alter release tags or replace published assets during an ordinary UI change.
