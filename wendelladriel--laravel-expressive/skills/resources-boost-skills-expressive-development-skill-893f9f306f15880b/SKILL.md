# Expressive Development

Use this skill when a Laravel application needs Typed Objects for Eloquent using Expressive.

## Primary Goal

- apply Expressive through its public Laravel integration points only
- keep Eloquent responsible for querying, relationship semantics, model events, mass assignment, and database writes
- prefer the smallest class, config, command, or mapping change that gives the application typed public properties

## Workflow

### 1. Inspect the Laravel app context

- confirm the app is a Laravel project and identify its Laravel/PHP versions before recommending installation
- inspect the target Eloquent model, casts, accessors, relationships, `$fillable`/`$guarded`, `$hidden`, and `$visible`
- check whether the application already uses DTOs, resources, actions, or domain objects so Expressive fits the existing boundary instead of replacing unrelated patterns
- decide whether the Expressive class should mirror the model shape, expose a smaller application boundary, or be generated and then edited

### 2. Install and configure only what is needed

- install with `composer require wendelladriel/laravel-expressive`; Laravel auto-discovers the service provider
- publish with `php artisan vendor:publish --tag="expressive"` only when the app needs `config/expressive.php` or `stubs/expressive.stub`
- publish only config with `php artisan vendor:publish --tag="expressive-config"` when changing namespace, suffix, strict mode, diagnostics, serialization casing, or generator defaults
- publish only the generator stub with `php artisan vendor:publish --tag="expressive-stubs"` when generated class formatting must be customized
- set `expressive.namespace` and `expressive.suffix` before relying on implicit lookup or running `make:expressive`
- set `expressive.strict` to `true` when Expressive objects should convert back to Eloquent models but never write database state through `save()`
- set `expressive.diagnostics.throw_on_unfillable` to `true` during adoption when ignored unfillable properties should fail fast
- set `expressive.serialization.case` to `snake` only when serialized keys should be snake case globally

### 3. Define mappings deliberately

- add `WendellAdriel\Expressive\Concerns\IsExpressive` only to Eloquent models that should expose `$model->expressive()`
- create Expressive classes under the configured namespace, or run `php artisan make:expressive User --model="App\Models\User"`
- run `php artisan expressive:generate --path="app/Models"` when scaffolding Expressive classes for multiple discovered Eloquent models
- Expressive classes must extend `WendellAdriel\Expressive\Expressive` and expose mapped data as public typed properties
- use `#[Model(User::class)]` on an Expressive class when the model cannot be inferred from namespace and suffix
- use `#[Expressive(UserData::class)]` on a model when it should resolve a specific Expressive class
- use `#[Map('remember_token')]` when a property maps to a non-default Eloquent key; unmapped non-relationship properties default to snake-case keys
- use `#[Relationship]` only for relationship properties, and `#[Virtual]` only for accessor/appended values
- keep relationship and virtual properties nullable because unloaded relationships and unrequested virtual accessors map to `null`
- type single relationships as `?RelatedExpressive`; type many relationships as `?Illuminate\Support\Collection` with `@var Collection<int, RelatedExpressive>|null`
- do not put mapping attributes on private or protected properties; Expressive only maps public non-static properties

### 4. Convert from Eloquent at explicit boundaries

- use `$model->expressive(relationships: [...], attributes: [...])` for a single opted-in model
- use `$eloquentCollection->expressive(relationships: [...], attributes: [...])` to convert an Eloquent collection without mutating the original collection
- use `$builder->expressive(relationships: [...], attributes: [...])` when it is acceptable to execute `get()` immediately and return an in-memory `Illuminate\Support\Collection`
- use `$builder->expressiveChunk($count, $callback, relationships: [...], attributes: [...])` for large result sets that can be processed with Laravel `chunk()`; the count must be at least `1`
- pass relationship names to `relationships` instead of relying on lazy loading; Expressive uses `loadMissing()` and leaves unloaded relationships as `null`
- pass accessor keys to `attributes` for virtual properties; Expressive calls Eloquent `append()` and leaves unrequested virtual values as `null`
- use API resources or transformers when the response contract differs from the Expressive object shape

### 5. Generate and sync classes safely

- use `php artisan make:expressive User --model="App\Models\User"` to generate a starting class from model columns, casts, relationships, and detected accessors
- use `php artisan expressive:generate` to scan `app/Models`, or pass one or more `--path` options for explicit model directories
- use `--exclude` with `expressive:generate` to skip selected model basenames or fully qualified class names
- use `--namespace`, `--suffix`, `--attributes`, `--without-attributes`, `--relationships`, `--without-relationships`, `--include-hidden`, `--exclude-hidden`, `--hint-morph-map`, `--dry-run`, and `--force` only for the current generation need
- remember hidden attributes are generated by default, but serialization still respects the mapped model's `hidden` and `visible` rules
- use `php artisan expressive:sync User --model="App\Models\User"` to detect drift; `--model` is required
- use `php artisan expressive:sync --all` in CI to scan the configured Expressive namespace and fail when generated classes drift from their mapped models
- combine `expressive:sync --all --write` only when generated classes are safe to rewrite in bulk
- add `--write` only for generated classes that are safe to rewrite; if the class has custom methods or intentional shape changes, update it manually
- treat sync output as review input because missing, stale, or type differences may be intentional application design

### 6. Serialize or persist intentionally

- use `$expressive->toArray()`, `$expressive->toJson()`, or `json_encode($expressive)` for direct serialization of initialized public properties
- expect nested Expressive objects and collections to serialize recursively
- expect uninitialized typed properties to be skipped; nullable properties with default `null` are initialized and may appear unless hidden or invisible
- use `$expressive->model()` to create an unsaved Eloquent model filled only with mapped, fillable, non-virtual, non-relationship properties
- use `$expressive->save()` to save the root model and supported direct relationships when `expressive.strict` is `false`: `BelongsTo`, `HasOne`, `MorphOne`, `HasMany`, and `MorphMany`
- keep `BelongsToMany`, morph-to-many, through relationships, pivot semantics, and deletion in explicit Eloquent application code

## Rules, References, and Templates

Read before executing:

- official documentation: `https://laravel-expressive.wendelladriel.com`
- installed package config after publishing: `config/expressive.php`
- installed package stub after publishing: `stubs/expressive.stub`
- target application models under `app/Models/`
- target application Expressive classes under the configured `expressive.namespace`
- Artisan help in the consuming app: `php artisan help make:expressive`, `php artisan help expressive:generate`, and `php artisan help expressive:sync`

## Examples

- For a read boundary, add `IsExpressive` to `App\Models\User`, run `php artisan make:expressive User --model="App\Models\User"`, keep `#[Relationship] public ?Collection $posts = null;`, then return `User::query()->where('active', true)->expressive(relationships: ['posts'])` from an application service.
- For a custom boundary, create `App\Data\PublicUser extends Expressive`, add `#[Model(App\Models\User::class)]`, include only public properties the service needs, and call `$user->expressive(attributes: ['display_name'])` when a nullable `#[Virtual]` property should be populated.
- For write input, hydrate an Expressive object from validated data, call `$object->model()` when application code should decide how to save or strict mode is enabled, or call `$object->save()` only when root fillable attributes and supported direct relationships should be persisted immediately.
- For CI drift checks, run `php artisan expressive:sync --all` and review differences before choosing either manual class edits or safe `--write` rewrites.

## Anti-patterns

- do not use Expressive as a replacement for Eloquent querying, resources, validation, authorization, model events, or relationship APIs
- do not make relationship or virtual properties non-nullable
- do not rely on lazy loading during conversion; request relationships explicitly
- do not expect virtual accessors to populate unless passed through `attributes`
- do not expect `model()` to save records or persist relationships
- do not call `save()` when `expressive.strict` is enabled; convert with `model()` and persist through Eloquent explicitly
- do not expect `save()` to handle many-to-many, morph-to-many, through relationships, pivot sync, detach, attach, or deletion
- do not use `make:expressive --force` or `expressive:sync --write` over custom classes without reviewing intentional user edits
- do not assume `expressive:sync --all` can decide whether customized class drift is intentional; treat its output as review input
- do not document private package classes as application-facing APIs
