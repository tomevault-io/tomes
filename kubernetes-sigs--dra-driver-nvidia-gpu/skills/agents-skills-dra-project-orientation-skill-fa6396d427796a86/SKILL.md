# DRA Project Orientation

Ground orientation answers in the current checkout. Use the map below as a routing aid, then inspect the relevant files before making detailed claims because features and component boundaries evolve.

## Start with the right sources

1. Locate the repository root with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` when the working directory is uncertain.
2. Read `README.md` for the project summary and support status.
3. Read `site/content/docs/concepts/architecture.md` for the component model and the GPU and ComputeDomain request flows.
4. Read the relevant concept page:
   - `site/content/docs/concepts/gpu-allocation.md` for full GPU, MIG, sharing, and VFIO behavior.
   - `site/content/docs/concepts/compute-domains.md` for Multi-Node NVLink, IMEX, and driver-managed versus host-managed lifecycles.
5. Verify details against the applicable `cmd/<component>/` entry point and implementation. Treat code and deployment manifests as authoritative for current behavior when prose and implementation differ.

Avoid beginning in `vendor/` or generated clients. Search first-party code with exclusions such as `rg <term> cmd api pkg internal deployments templates site demo test tests hack -g '!pkg/nvidia.com/**'`. Include `pkg/nvidia.com/` only when tracing generated Kubernetes client behavior.

## Understand the system shape

This is a Go implementation of two Kubernetes Dynamic Resource Allocation drivers:

- `gpu.nvidia.com` allocates and configures full GPUs, MIG devices, shared GPU access, and VFIO passthrough.
- `compute-domain.nvidia.com` provides IMEX channel devices for ephemeral, isolated Multi-Node NVLink ComputeDomains.

The Helm chart deploys five binaries. Use these paths to find the owner of runtime behavior:

| Component | Role and first places to inspect |
|---|---|
| `cmd/gpu-kubelet-plugin/` | Per-node GPU DRA plugin. Start at `main.go` for configuration, `driver.go` for plugin startup, ResourceSlice publication, and kubelet Prepare/Unprepare callbacks, and `device_state.go` for the main claim preparation state machine. Continue to `allocatable.go`, `deviceinfo.go`, `mig.go`, `sharing.go`, `mps_capability.go`, `vfio-*.go`, `cdi.go`, `checkpoint*.go`, or `device_health.go` according to the feature. |
| `cmd/compute-domain-kubelet-plugin/` | Per-node ComputeDomain DRA plugin. Start at `main.go`, `driver.go`, and `device_state.go`; use `computedomain.go` for domain readiness/state, `cdi.go` for IMEX device injection, and `checkpoint*.go` for persisted preparation state. |
| `cmd/compute-domain-controller/` | Cluster controller for `ComputeDomain` lifecycle. Start at `controller.go` and `computedomain.go`; resource-specific managers in `daemonset.go`, `resourceclaimtemplate.go`, `node.go`, `cdclique.go`, and `cdstatus.go` own reconciliation, generated objects, cleanup, and status. |
| `cmd/compute-domain-daemon/` | Per-ComputeDomain node daemon that runs and supervises `nvidia-imex` and publishes peer/readiness information. Start at `main.go`, `controller.go`, and `process.go`; then inspect `cdclique.go` or `cdstatus.go`, `dnsnames.go`, and `podmanager.go`. |
| `cmd/webhook/` | Optional validating admission webhook for opaque configurations on `ResourceClaim` and `ResourceClaimTemplate` objects. Start at `main.go`; validation dispatch and Kubernetes API-version conversion live in `resource.go`. |

Keep these relationships explicit when explaining how components fit:

- GPU path: a claim's opaque config is defined under `api/`, optionally checked by the webhook, allocated by Kubernetes from ResourceSlices published by the GPU plugin, then prepared by that plugin into CDI devices for the container runtime.
- Driver-managed ComputeDomain path: the controller watches `ComputeDomain` CRs and creates per-domain DaemonSets and claim templates; daemon pods run IMEX and report membership/readiness; the ComputeDomain kubelet plugin validates readiness and injects selected IMEX channels.
- Host-managed ComputeDomain path: the host owns the IMEX daemon; the controller does not create per-domain daemon infrastructure, and the kubelet plugin checks the host daemon before injecting a channel.
- Both kubelet plugins run per node. The controller and webhook are cluster-level deployments; the ComputeDomain daemon is created per domain in driver-managed mode.

## Route contracts, shared code, and deployment wiring

- `api/nvidia.com/resource/v1beta1/` contains the handwritten NVIDIA API contracts, registration, defaulting/normalization, and validation for opaque GPU and ComputeDomain configs and the `ComputeDomain` and `ComputeDomainClique` CRs.
- `pkg/nvidia.com/` is generated clientset, informer, and lister code. `api/**/zz_generated.deepcopy.go` and Helm CRDs are also generated outputs. Change the API source rather than generated artifacts, then use `make generate` and `make check-generate` as appropriate.
- `pkg/featuregates/`, `pkg/flags/`, and `pkg/metrics/` hold cross-component feature gates, CLI/Kubernetes configuration, and metrics. `pkg/imex/` and `pkg/fabricmanager/` own shared domain-specific integrations; `pkg/flock/` and `pkg/workqueue/` provide reusable coordination primitives.
- `internal/common/` contains implementation shared only within this module; `internal/info/` contains build/version metadata.
- `deployments/helm/dra-driver-nvidia-gpu/` is the installation source of truth. Read `values.yaml`, `deployments/helm/dra-driver-nvidia-gpu/templates/kubeletplugin.yaml`, `deployments/helm/dra-driver-nvidia-gpu/templates/controller.yaml`, and the relevant RBAC, DeviceClass, CRD, or webhook template to learn whether and how code is enabled and wired.
- `templates/` contains manifests and configuration rendered dynamically by running components, including per-ComputeDomain and MPS resources. Do not confuse these with the install-time Helm templates.
- `deployments/container/` builds the runtime image. `deployments/devel/` defines the development-tooling image and code-generation tools.

## Route documentation and onboarding

- `site/content/docs/` is the documentation site's source. Use `install.md`, `prerequisites.md`, and `upgrade.md` for lifecycle tasks; `guides/` for user workflows; and `reference/` for APIs, feature gates, Helm values, and ResourceSlice attributes.
- `demo/specs/` provides concrete claims and workloads. `demo/clusters/` contains kind, nvkind, GKE, and OpenShift setup helpers.
- `site/content/contribute/development.md` gives the build, unit-test, code-generation, lint, Helm, and local-cluster loop. Confirm target definitions in the root `Makefile`.
- Unit tests live beside Go implementation files. `test/e2e/` is the Go/Ginkgo GPU allocation suite. `tests/bats/` is the broader, invasive live-cluster integration suite; read its `README.md` before recommending it. CI-specific cluster harnesses live under `hack/ci/`, while GitHub checks live in `.github/workflows/`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `RELEASE.md`, and `site/content/contribute/` cover contribution and release processes.

For a general onboarding request, propose this reading path: `README.md` → architecture → the relevant GPU or ComputeDomain concept page → the corresponding `cmd/` component → its Helm template → adjacent unit tests → one matching demo. Add `site/content/contribute/development.md` before suggesting local changes.

## Determine ownership accurately

- Read the root `OWNERS` file for official reviewer and approver roles. It is the only first-party `OWNERS` file in this repository, so it applies repo-wide unless the current checkout adds a more specific ownership file.
- Ignore ownership files inside `vendor/`; they describe upstream dependencies, not this project.
- Describe logical source ownership by directory or component using the map above. Do not assign an individual as the owner of a subsystem without an explicit, scoped ownership source.
- If the user asks for likely historical expertise rather than formal ownership, `git log -- <path>` may provide context. Label that as commit history, not official ownership.

## Shape the answer to the request

- For “what does this repo do?”, lead with the two drivers, then distinguish cluster-level and node-level components.
- For “where does this logic live?”, name the narrowest relevant directory, file, and important symbol or callback; trace one layer upstream and downstream when that clarifies the flow.
- For “how do components fit?”, explain either the GPU request flow or the ComputeDomain lifecycle instead of listing every directory.
- For onboarding, give a short reading and hands-on path tailored to GPU allocation, ComputeDomains, deployment, documentation, or testing.
- For ownership, separate official review/approval ownership from the component that logically owns the implementation.

Link to exact repository paths in the final answer. State which files were inspected, call out generated code, feature-gated behavior, and defaults that can change, and avoid presenting demos or documentation prose as proof of runtime behavior without checking the implementation and Helm wiring.
