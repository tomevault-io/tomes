# Security Reference

## Security Model Details

Authentication, Bridge defense, IDOR prevention, secret management, IAM roles:

- [architecture.md §7](../../../docs/architecture.md) — Bridge defense, authentication, IDOR, secrets, IAM

## Security Checklist (For Code Writing/Review)

### Bridge Server

- [ ] Bearer token authentication applied to all endpoints except `/health`
- [ ] TLS (self-signed) applied (`https.createServer`)
- [ ] Gateway bound to `--bind localhost` to block external access
- [ ] Running as non-root user (`USER openclaw`)
- [ ] `/health` returns only `{ "status": "ok" }` (no internal info exposure)

### Secrets

- [ ] API keys/tokens NOT written to `openclaw.json`
- [ ] Using `config.auth = { method: "env" }`
- [ ] `delete config.auth?.apiKey` applied
- [ ] `delete config.gateway?.auth?.token` applied
- [ ] Delivered only via Secrets Manager → environment variables

### IDOR

- [ ] userId determined server-side (JWT `sub` or connectionId reverse lookup)
- [ ] Client-provided userId not trusted
- [ ] DynamoDB query PK uses `jwt.sub`

### Authentication

- [ ] WebSocket: `?token={jwt}` → verified in ws-connect
- [ ] REST API: Cognito User Pool Authorizer applied
- [ ] Telegram: `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` verification + pairing check

### IAM

- [ ] Lambda: access only to required DynamoDB tables (resource ARN restricted)
- [ ] Fargate: access only to S3 data bucket
- [ ] ECS permissions: Condition restricted to specific cluster
- [ ] PassRole: only task-role and exec-role allowed

### Lambda Agent (Phase 2)

See [architecture.md §security](../../../docs/architecture.md) for full Lambda security details.

- [ ] Lambda IAM least privilege: `S3:GetObject/PutObject` on `sessions/*` prefix only
- [ ] Lambda IAM: `SSM:GetParameter` on `secrets/*` prefix only (no wildcard)
- [ ] Lambda IAM: `DynamoDB:GetItem/PutItem/DeleteItem` on TaskState table only
- [ ] Lambda IAM: `cloudwatch:PutMetricData` for custom metrics (namespace-restricted)
- [ ] `SessionLock` prevents concurrent Lambda invocations accessing same session
- [ ] No secrets on disk: `HOME=/tmp`, env vars only (never write API keys to files)
- [ ] Lambda container: non-root user, read-only root filesystem where possible
