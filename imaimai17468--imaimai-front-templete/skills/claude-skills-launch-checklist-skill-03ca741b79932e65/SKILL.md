# Pre-Launch Web Service Checklist

Comprehensively audit a pre-launch service and write a report to `docs/launch-checklist/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

Reference: https://zenn.dev/catnose99/articles/547cbf57e5ad28

## Current git context

!`git log --oneline -1`

## Procedure

### 1. Determine audit scope

If `$category` is provided, audit only that category. Otherwise audit all categories.

Valid categories: `security`, `seo`, `ogp`, `performance`, `a11y`, `email`, `payment`, `env`, `all`

### 2. Run checklist audit

For each category in scope, inspect the codebase, configuration, and running application against the checklist below. Use grep, file reads, and chrome-devtools MCP tools as needed.

## Checklist

### Security — Cookie

| # | Item | How to verify |
|---|------|---------------|
| 1 | Auth cookies have the `HttpOnly` attribute set | Check the cookie options in auth config files / middleware |
| 2 | Auth cookies have `SameSite=Lax` or `Strict` set | Same as above. For `Lax`, confirm there is no endpoint that performs mutations on GET requests |
| 3 | Auth cookies have the `Secure` attribute set | Same as above |
| 4 | Auth cookies have an appropriate `Domain` attribute | Check the risk of cookie leakage to subdomains. Using the `__Host-` prefix is recommended |

| 5 | User input is validated on both the client and the server | Check form submission handling and server-side handlers |
| 6 | URL inputs have protocol restrictions (e.g. blocking `javascript:` URLs) | Grep form fields that accept URLs and check the validation logic |
| 7 | HTML output is escaped / sanitized | Grep usages of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and `innerHTML` and check for sanitization |
| 8 | SQL injection is prevented | Check usages of raw SQL queries. Confirm the ORM's parameter binding is used |
