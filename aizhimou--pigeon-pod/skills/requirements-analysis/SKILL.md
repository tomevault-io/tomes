description: Analyze product and technical requirements for the PigeonPod project with software engineering rigor. Use when users ask to evaluate a feature, enhancement, non-functional requirement, integration, or migration for value, feasibility, architecture fit, implementation impact, risk, delivery scope, or tradeoffs. Do not use for bug triage or root-cause analysis; use `bug-analysis` for bugfix-oriented work. Always inspect current repository docs and code first, then use MCP tools including Context7 to verify external library, framework, or API constraints before concluding. Use when this capability is needed.

# Requirements Analysis

Analyze requirements against PigeonPod goals, current architecture, and implementation reality.

## Follow This Workflow

1. Restate the requirement in one short paragraph.
2. Identify requirement type: `feature`, `enhancement`, `non-functional`, `integration`, or `migration`.
3. Define expected user value and business value.
4. Read relevant project docs and code before giving conclusions.
5. Use MCP/Context7 to confirm dependency or API constraints when external libraries/services are involved.
6. Evaluate architecture fit, implementation complexity, data impact, and operational impact.
7. Propose an implementation strategy with phased scope (`MVP`, `next`, `later`).
8. Output a decision with explicit rationale and open questions.

If the request is primarily about broken behavior, regressions, incorrect results, crashes, or root-cause analysis, use `bug-analysis` instead.

## Read Local Context First

Prioritize these files for PigeonPod:

- `README.md`
- `dev-docs/architecture/architecture-design-en.md`
- `backend/src/main/resources/application.yml`
- `backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/*.sql`
- Relevant backend packages under `backend/src/main/java/top/asimov/pigeon/`
- Relevant frontend routes/components under `frontend/src/pages/` and `frontend/src/components/`

Use fast discovery commands when needed:

```bash
rg -n "keyword|concept|module" backend/src/main/java frontend/src dev-docs README.md
rg --files dev-docs/
```

## Use Context7 and MCP Deliberately

Use Context7/MCP when the requirement depends on framework/library/service behavior, version constraints, configuration, or integration details.

Typical triggers:

- Spring Boot/MyBatis-Plus/Sa-Token behavior or config decisions
- React/Mantine/React Router/i18next/Axios constraints
- YouTube Data API v3 limits/quotas/contract details
- RSS/Podcasting namespace compatibility details
- yt-dlp options/behavior and compatibility implications

Rules:

- Resolve library ID first, then query focused questions.
- Prefer primary/official docs and version-aware guidance.
- Distinguish facts from inference.
- If docs conflict with local implementation, prioritize local code reality and call out the gap.

## Evaluate With These Dimensions

Assess each dimension explicitly:

1. Value Alignment: Match with PigeonPod core goals (YouTube-to-podcast conversion, auto-sync/download, feed usability, operations simplicity).
2. Feasibility: Confirm technical possibility with current stack and constraints.
3. Architecture Fit: Check compatibility with backend service boundaries, scheduler/event flow, DB schema, and frontend route/state model.
4. Data and Migration Impact: Identify new fields/tables, migration requirements, backfill, and backward compatibility.
5. API and Contract Impact: Identify REST/RSS contract changes and consumer compatibility risks.
6. Security and Compliance: Review auth, permissions, secrets/API keys, abuse vectors.
7. Performance and Cost: Estimate queue pressure, I/O/download load, external API quota consumption, and storage growth.
8. Testability and Operability: Define unit/integration/e2e coverage and monitoring/logging needs.

## Produce This Output Format

Use this structure in final analysis:

```markdown
## Requirement Summary
- User request:
- Requirement type:
- Assumptions:

## Value Assessment
- User value:
- Product/business value:
- Priority suggestion: High/Medium/Low

## Feasibility and Architecture Fit
- Current touchpoints:
- Proposed changes:
- Architecture fit verdict: Good/Partial/Poor

## Impact Analysis
- Backend impact:
- Frontend impact:
- Database/migration impact:
- External dependency impact:
- Security/performance/ops impact:

## Delivery Plan
- MVP scope:
- Non-MVP scope:
- Estimated complexity: S/M/L/XL
- Key risks and mitigations:

## Decision
- Recommendation: Proceed / Proceed with constraints / Defer / Reject
- Reasoning:
- Open questions:
```

## Decision Heuristics

- Recommend `Proceed` when value is clear, fit is good, and risk is manageable.
- Recommend `Proceed with constraints` when value is high but scope/risk needs staged delivery.
- Recommend `Defer` when value exists but prerequisites are missing.
- Recommend `Reject` when requirement conflicts with core goals or creates disproportional cost/risk.

## Quality Bar

Before finalizing, verify all checks:

- Base conclusions on repository evidence, not assumptions only.
- Confirm external-library/API claims through Context7/MCP when relevant.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and unknowns.
- Include at least one feasible implementation path.
- Include explicit tradeoffs and rollback/fallback considerations.
