# Cherimoya

Cherimoya is a compact deep learning model that predicts genomic profile data —
transcription-factor binding, chromatin accessibility, transcription initiation —
directly from DNA sequence. It ships an end-to-end command-line pipeline that takes
raw sequencing data through peak calling, training, attribution, and motif
discovery in a couple of commands, and a small Python API for programmatic use.

This skill helps you drive that pipeline for someone who may not know the
terminology. **Most of the value here is behavioral, not encyclopedic:** be
robust, ask before guessing, and always explain what a default did.

## How to use this skill

1. Read the three operating rules below — they apply to *every* task.
2. Figure out what the user actually wants (train? evaluate? interpret results?
   troubleshoot?) and which inputs they have.
3. Open only the reference file that matches the task (table at the bottom).
   Do not preload all of them.

## Three operating rules (always in effect)

### 1. Ask, don't guess — for anything biologically meaningful

A wrong genome build, strandedness, or read-shift produces a model that trains
without error and is quietly wrong. So before running anything, confirm the
things that can't be recovered from a filename:

- **What is the assay?** (ATAC-seq, DNase-seq, ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN, PRO-seq, …)
  This drives stranded-vs-unstranded, fragment-vs-read, and read shifts. See
  `references/assay-defaults.md`.
- **What genome build are the reads aligned to?** (hg38, hg19, mm10, …) The
  FASTA, the peaks, and the default chromosome split must all match it.
- **Which files does the user actually have**, and what is each one? Never
  invent a path. See `references/input-files.md`.
- **What is the goal?** "Is my data any good?" → train + read
  `performance.tsv`. "What motifs did it learn?" → attributions + seqlets +
  TF-MoDISco. Map lay language onto subcommands before acting.

When in doubt, ask a short question. One clarifying question is always cheaper
than a wasted training run.

### 2. Handle missing files by asking, not by inventing

The required inputs for training are a **genome FASTA** and at least one
**signal file**. Peaks, negatives, controls, and a motif database are optional
(the pipeline generates or skips them). Before building a pipeline JSON:

- List which required inputs are present and which are missing.
- If a required input is missing, **ask the user for it** — do not fabricate a
  path or silently proceed.
- If an *optional* input is missing, say what the pipeline will do instead
  (e.g. "no peaks given → MACS3 will call them", "no negatives given →
  GC-matched negatives will be sampled") so the user can veto it.
- `cherimoya pipeline` runs a pre-flight check and hard-fails listing every
  missing local path. Your job is to catch this *earlier* by asking. Note that
  remote paths (`http://`, `https://`, `s3://`, `gs://`) are skipped by the
  check and streamed directly.
- If a JSON key points at a file the pipeline is *supposed to produce later*
  (e.g. `loci` pointing at a not-yet-called peak file), set that key to `null`
  and let the pipeline make it — otherwise the pre-flight rejects the run.

### 3. Use reasonable defaults — and explain them

Every default lives in `cherimoya_cli/defaults.py`; quote the real value, never
a guessed one. Whenever a default or an automatic step kicks in, tell the user
in one plain sentence what happened and why. Examples:

- "You didn't pass peaks, so MACS3 will call them at q < 0.05 (its default)."
- "Training will use chr8 and chr20 as held-out validation — the hg38 default.
  If your data isn't hg38, we need to change this."
- "The model trains for all 20 epochs — early stopping is off by default — and
  the checkpoint kept is the epoch with the best validation count Pearson."

The point is that a novice should never be surprised by something the pipeline
did on their behalf.

## The common request: "train a model on my data"

The end-to-end flow is two commands (details in
`references/cli-training-pipeline.md`):

```bash
# 1. Turn raw-data pointers into a fully-populated JSON config.
cherimoya pipeline-json -s genome.fa -i signal.bam -m motifs.meme \
    -n my_run -o my_run.pipeline.json

# 2. Run every step from that JSON.
cherimoya pipeline -p my_run.pipeline.json
```

Before running step 1, walk rule 1 and rule 2: confirm the assay, the genome
build, and which inputs exist. `pipeline-json` fills everything else from
defaults, and step 2 runs every stage through to marginalization. Some stages
are conditional — notably, tomtom-lite seqlet annotation and marginalization
run only when a motif database (`-m`) is given. See
`references/cli-training-pipeline.md` for the per-step table and what gates each
step.
