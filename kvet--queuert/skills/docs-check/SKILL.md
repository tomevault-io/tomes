# Documentation Sync Check

Analyze git changes to identify documentation that may need updating. This skill compares code modifications against reference docs (`docs/src/content/docs/advanced/`) and package READMEs to ensure documentation stays in sync with the codebase.

## Instructions

When this skill is invoked:

1. Read the detailed agent instructions from `.claude/agents/docs-check/instructions.md`
2. Gather the current changes using git diff
3. Map code changes to relevant documentation
4. Analyze whether documentation needs updating
5. Provide a structured report with findings

## Usage

```
/docs-check              # Check all uncommitted changes
/docs-check --staged     # Check only staged changes
/docs-check <commit>     # Check changes in a specific commit
/docs-check <base>..<head>  # Check changes between commits
```

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Changes

Based on arguments:

- No args: `git diff HEAD` (all uncommitted changes)
- `--staged`: `git diff --staged`
- `<commit>`: `git show <commit>`
- `<base>..<head>`: `git diff <base>..<head>`

Also run `git diff --name-only` (with appropriate flags) to get the list of changed files.

### Step 2: Categorize Changed Files

Group changes by their documentation relevance:

| File Pattern        | Related Documentation                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/*/src/**` | TSDoc on exports, package README, relevant reference docs in `docs/src/content/docs/advanced/` |
| `examples/**`       | Package READMEs, `CLAUDE.md`                                                                   |
| Exports/public API  | TSDoc on exports, package README, `CLAUDE.md`                                                  |

Look in `docs/src/content/docs/advanced/` to identify which reference docs are relevant for a given package or subsystem.

### Step 3: Analyze Documentation Impact

For each category of changes, determine:

1. **API Changes**: New exports, renamed functions, changed signatures
2. **Behavioral Changes**: Modified algorithms, new features, changed defaults
3. **Structural Changes**: New files, moved code, renamed modules
4. **Configuration Changes**: New options, changed config shapes

### Step 4: Check Documentation

Read relevant documentation files and compare against code changes:

- Are new features/APIs documented?
- Do examples still match the current API?
- Are behavioral descriptions still accurate?
- Is terminology consistent with code?

### Step 5: Generate Report

Provide a structured report categorizing findings by urgency.

## Output Format

```markdown
# Documentation Sync Check

## Summary

[Brief overview of changes and documentation status]

## Changes Analyzed

- [List of changed files grouped by area]

## Documentation Updates Required

### Must Update

[Documentation that is definitely out of sync - factually incorrect, missing new features, wrong API signatures]

### Should Review

[Documentation that may need updating - behavioral changes, new edge cases, terminology]

### Already Up to Date

[Documentation that was checked and appears current]

## Specific Recommendations

### [doc-file-path]

- **Issue**: [What's wrong or missing]
- **Code Reference**: [Which code change necessitates this]
- **Suggested Action**: [What to update]

## No Documentation Impact

[Changes that don't require documentation updates and why]
```

## Severity Definitions

- **MUST UPDATE**: Documentation is factually incorrect or missing critical information
  - Incorrect API signatures or examples
  - Missing documentation for new public APIs
  - Wrong behavioral descriptions

- **SHOULD REVIEW**: Documentation may be stale or incomplete
  - Changed default values or behaviors
  - New edge cases or limitations
  - Terminology drift

- **NO IMPACT**: Changes that don't affect documentation
  - Internal refactoring with no API changes
  - Test-only changes
  - Bug fixes that don't change documented behavior
