# Publish Readiness Review

Run a comprehensive review of the Queuert library before publishing. This skill launches 8 specialized review agents in parallel to check different aspects of publish readiness.

## Instructions

When this skill is invoked, you MUST:

1. Launch all 8 review agents IN PARALLEL using the Task tool with a single message containing 8 tool calls
2. Wait for all agents to complete
3. Write a combined report to `docs/publish-readiness-report.md`
4. Display a summary of findings in the conversation

## Agents to Launch

Launch these 7 agents in parallel using the Task tool (all in one message with 7 Task tool calls):

### 1. Documentation Coherence Agent

```
subagent_type: general-purpose
description: Review docs coherence
prompt: |
  You are a documentation coherence reviewer for the Queuert library.

  First, read the detailed instructions in .claude/agents/publish-review/docs-coherence.md

  Then review all documentation for coherence and consistency:
  - TSDoc on all public exports in packages/*/src/**/*.ts (primary API documentation)
  - README.md - User-facing overview
  - CLAUDE.md - Session instructions (workflow requirements, high-level links)
  - docs/src/content/docs/advanced/*.md - Reference documents (architectural, defer to TSDoc for API signatures)
  - packages/*/README.md - Package READMEs (API documentation)

  Check for:
  1. Terminology consistency across all docs
  2. Feature parity between design docs, TSDoc, and package READMEs
  3. Code example accuracy (syntax, current API)
  4. Cross-reference integrity (valid links/paths)
  5. Completeness gaps (exports missing TSDoc or not documented in package READMEs)

  Categorize findings as CRITICAL, WARNING, or SUGGESTION.
  Return a structured report with specific file locations.
```

### 2. API Design Review Agent

```
subagent_type: general-purpose
description: Review API design
prompt: |
  You are an API design reviewer for the Queuert library.

  First, read the detailed instructions in .claude/agents/publish-review/api-design.md

  Then review the public API across all packages/*/src/index.ts for design issues,
  following the checks described in the instructions file.

  Categorize findings as CRITICAL, WARNING, or SUGGESTION.
  Return a structured report.
```

### 3. Implementation Verification Agent

```
subagent_type: general-purpose
description: Verify implementation
prompt: |
  You are an implementation verification agent for the Queuert library.

  First, read the detailed instructions in .claude/agents/publish-review/impl-verification.md

  Then verify implementation matches documentation by following the checks
  described in the instructions file: export audit, interface compliance,
  design doc compliance, test coverage, and example verification.

  Categorize findings as CRITICAL, WARNING, or SUGGESTION.
  Return a structured report.
```

### 4. Feature Completeness Agent

```
subagent_type: general-purpose
description: Check feature completeness
prompt: |
  You are a feature completeness auditor for the Queuert library.

  First, read the detailed instructions in .claude/agents/publish-review/feature-completeness.md

  Then identify undercooked features and missing functionality by following
  the checks described in the instructions file: TODO.md audit, test health,
  example completeness, package readiness, and feature gaps.

  Categorize findings as CRITICAL, WARNING, or SUGGESTION.
  Return a structured report.
```

### 5. API Consistency Agent

```
subagent_type: general-purpose
description: Check API consistency
prompt: |
  You are an API consistency reviewer for the Queuert library.

  First, read the detailed instructions in .claude/agents/publish-review/api-consistency.md

  Then ensure consistent patterns across all packages by following the checks
  described in the instructions file: cross-package patterns, configuration,
  lifecycle, type exports, testing exports, error handling, and re-exports.

  Categorize findings as CRITICAL, WARNING, or SUGGESTION.
  Return a structured report with recommendations for standardization.
```

### 6. Schema Review Agent

```
subagent_type: general-purpose
description: Review schema design
prompt: |
  You are a database schema reviewer for the Queuert library.

  First, read the detailed instructions in .claude/agents/publish-review/schema-review.md

  Then review the state adapter schema design across PostgreSQL and SQLite by
  following the checks described in the instructions file: index coverage,
  normalization, query efficiency, cross-backend consistency, forward-compatibility,
  locking/concurrency, and data integrity.

  Categorize findings as CRITICAL, WARNING, or SUGGESTION.
  Return a structured report.
```

### 7. Code Style Agent

```
subagent_type: general-purpose
description: Review code style
prompt: |
  You are a code style reviewer for the Queuert library.

  First, read the detailed instructions in .claude/agents/publish-review/code-style.md

  Then verify the codebase follows conventions from code-style.md by
  following the checks described in the instructions file: function declaration style,
  unnecessary async wrapping, redundant types, comment quality, nullable conventions,
  error class usage, and naming conventions.

  Categorize findings as CRITICAL, WARNING, or SUGGESTION.
  Return a structured report.
```

### 8. Benchmarks Agent

```
subagent_type: general-purpose
description: Run benchmarks
prompt: |
  You are a benchmarks runner for the Queuert library.

  Run `pnpm benchmarks` from the repository root to execute all benchmarks
  (memory footprint and type complexity).

  Report:
  1. Whether all benchmarks ran successfully
  2. Any errors or failures encountered
  3. Notable results or regressions compared to values documented in
     docs/src/content/docs/integrations/benchmarks.md

  Categorize findings as CRITICAL, WARNING, or SUGGESTION.
  Return a structured report.
```

## Report Format

After all agents complete, write the combined report to `docs/publish-readiness-report.md` with this structure:

## Known Accepted Items (Ignore List)

The following items have been reviewed and accepted as intentional design decisions. Agents should NOT flag these:

- **`createOtelObservabilityAdapter` is async**: Reserves the right to add async initialization later. Accepted.
- **`helpersSymbol` exported publicly but marked `@internal`**: Required by `@queuert/dashboard` and `createInProcessWorker`. The `@internal` annotation is a convention, not enforcement. Accepted.
- **`createAsyncLock` re-exported from `@queuert/sqlite` via `queuert/internal`**: SQLite users need this for transaction serialization. Accepted.
- **`createClient` is async but performs no I/O**: Reserves the right to add async initialization later. Accepted.
- **`createInProcessWorker` is async but performs no I/O**: Reserves the right to add async initialization later. Accepted.
- **`$idType` phantom property on `createPgStateAdapter` options**: Intentional pattern for generic type inference. Accepted.
- **`HookNotRegisteredError` does not accept `cause`**: This error is never caused by another error. Accepted.
- **Notify adapter channel prefix uses different separators**: Each adapter uses its transport's idiomatic separator (`:` for Redis, `_` for PG, `.` for NATS). Accepted.
- **`testing` export declared in `publishConfig` but files excluded**: Testing utilities are workspace-only, not shipped to npm. The `publishConfig.exports` entry is overridden by the `files` exclusion. Accepted.
- **NATS notify adapter lacks provider abstraction**: NATS is experimental. A provider abstraction will be added when the API stabilizes. Accepted.
- **NATS package exports no types from index.ts**: NATS is experimental. Types will be exported when the API stabilizes. Accepted.
- **NATS notify adapter uses `nc`/`kv` instead of `provider`**: NATS is experimental. Will standardize to provider pattern when API stabilizes. Accepted.
- **NATS notify adapter uses `subjectPrefix` while PG and Redis use `channelPrefix`**: Each adapter uses its transport's idiomatic terminology. Accepted.
- **State adapter factory options differ between PG and SQLite for ID generation**: Intentional — each adapter uses the most natural approach for its database (`idDefault` SQL expression for PG, `idGenerator` JS function for SQLite). Accepted.
- **`TransactionContextRequiredError` does not accept `cause`**: This error signals API misuse (calling mutating methods without `runInTransaction`), never caused by another error. Accepted.
- **OTEL `workerError` does not record error details**: Counter attributes should remain low-cardinality per OTEL best practices. Error details are captured via the Log adapter. Accepted.
- **`getNextJobAvailableInMsSql` uses `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`**: Tracked in TODO.md for future cleanup. Accepted for now.
- **SQLite `checkExternalBlockerRefsSql` lacks row locking**: SQLite serializes writes via exclusive transaction locking, providing equivalent safety. Accepted.
- **`listJobChains` status filter applies post-join**: Acceptable for dashboard queries with pagination. A denormalized chain status column can be added if performance becomes an issue. Accepted.
- **SQLite `createJobs` performs per-job queries (O(n) round-trips)**: Documented and accepted SQLite trade-off. Tracked in TODO.md. Accepted.
- **SQLite `addJobsBlockers` performs per-job-blocker-group loop (O(n) round-trips)**: Same accepted SQLite trade-off. Tracked in TODO.md. Accepted.
- **Package READMEs are minimal**: Package READMEs link to the docs site for API documentation. This is the intended pattern. Accepted.

## Severity Definitions

- **CRITICAL**: Must fix before publish (breaking inconsistency, docs lie about behavior, missing critical export)
- **WARNING**: Should fix (minor inconsistencies, unclear docs, suboptimal patterns)
- **SUGGESTION**: Nice to have (style improvements, additional docs, polish)
