# Send

Constructs an unsigned ETH or USDC transfer transaction on Base. Returns the raw transaction object for the client to sign and broadcast.

## Endpoint

```
POST https://pinionos.com/skill/send
```

**Price:** $0.01 USDC per call (x402 on Base)

## Request Body

```json
{
  "to": "0x...",
  "amount": "0.1",
  "token": "ETH"
}
```

| Field  | Type   | Required | Description                              |
|--------|--------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| to     | string | yes      | Recipient address (0x, 40 hex chars)      |
| amount | string | yes      | Amount to send (human-readable)           |
| token  | string | yes      | `ETH` or `USDC`                          |

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://pinionos.com/skill/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to":"0x7a21...","amount":"0.05","token":"ETH"}'
```

The first request returns HTTP 402 with payment requirements. Sign a USDC `TransferWithAuthorization` (EIP-3009) and retry with the `X-PAYMENT` header.

- Fund a sub-wallet or pay for services.
