## Syncing vdir-backed data

After creating, editing, moving, or deleting anything backed by vdir (todos, calendar events, or contacts), start vdirsyncer so the change propagates:

```bash
systemctl --user start vdirsyncer
```

## Todos (todomd + `.ics`)

Todos live in a vdir at `~/Calendars/personal/`. `todomd` is the CLI, and `todo`
is a fish abbreviation for it. Todoman is no longer installed.

### Reading

`todomd show` prints tasks as JSON. It is read-only: no editor, no hooks, no
terminal needed.

```bash
todomd show                       # active tasks in every list
todomd show Postgrad Casa         # chosen lists
todomd show --completed Postgrad  # include completed and cancelled
```

Each entry has `list`, `uid`, `summary`, `completed`, and `file`:

```json
{
  "list": "Casa",
  "uid": "542812992406319126",
  "summary": "Arrumar fechadura escritório",
  "completed": false,
  "file": "/home/gabriel/Calendars/personal/7eebf97d-.../542812992406319126.ics"
}
```

Use `file` to reach an item. Filenames are chosen by whatever created the task,
so a UID is not a path: don't construct one, and don't grep for the summary.
`list` is already the display name, so there is no need to map UUID directories
through their `displayname` files.

`SUMMARY` is optional in iCalendar. A task without one cannot be rendered, so
`todomd` skips it and reports the path on stderr.

### Do not run `todomd edit`

`todomd edit`, and bare `todomd`, opens `$VISUAL` and asks `[y/N]` on an
interactive terminal. It also stops vdirsyncer for the duration. That is Gabs's
path, not an agent's. Write through the `.ics` file instead.

### Writing

Edit the `.ics` at `file`, then sync. Increment `SEQUENCE` on every change.

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SUMMARY:` | Todo title |
| `DESCRIPTION:` | Body text |
| `PRIORITY:` | 1=high/`!!!`, 5=medium/`!!`, 9=low/`!` (ical default: 1 highest) |
| `CATEGORIES:` | Comma-separated tags (delete line to remove all categories) |
| `DUE:` | Due date (`YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ`, or `DUE;VALUE=DATE:YYYYMMDD`) |
| `STATUS:` | `NEEDS-ACTION`, `IN-PROCESS`, `COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED` |
| `RELATED-TO;RELTYPE=PARENT:` | Parent task's UID, set on the child |
| `SEQUENCE:` | Bump on each edit |

**Completing:** set `STATUS:COMPLETED`, `COMPLETED:<timestamp>`, and
`PERCENT-COMPLETE:100`. Reopening means `STATUS:NEEDS-ACTION` with `COMPLETED`
and `PERCENT-COMPLETE` removed.

**Creating:** write a new `<uid>.ics` in the list's directory. Minimum viable
VTODO:

```ics
BEGIN:VCALENDAR
VERSION:2.0
PRODID:-//agent//EN
BEGIN:VTODO
UID:<fresh uuid>
DTSTAMP:20260906T010239Z
CREATED:20260906T010239Z
LAST-MODIFIED:20260906T010239Z
SEQUENCE:0
STATUS:NEEDS-ACTION
SUMMARY:Task text
END:VTODO
END:VCALENDAR
```

**Subtasks:** create the parent first, then put
`RELATED-TO;RELTYPE=PARENT:<parent-uid>` in each child. Use this for shopping
batches: one parent like `mercado` in `Casa`, one child per item.

**Moving between lists:** move the file into the target list's directory.

```bash
mv ~/Calendars/personal/<from-dir>/<uid>.ics ~/Calendars/personal/<to-dir>/
```

### Conventions

Gabs uses categories as tags.

Priority markers: `!!!` (high), `!!` (medium), `!` (low), `Quick Win` (category).
Status markers: `Blocked` (category) — means an **external** dependency prevents progress (e.g. out of supplies, waiting on someone else). NOT "I haven't gotten to it" or "it's my turn." If Gabs could do it right now but hasn't, that's not blocked — that's just pending.

## Appointments (khal)

Calendar stored as vdir `.ics` files under `~/Calendars/personal/Personal/`. Use `khal`.

```bash
khal list today 2d             # today + next 2 days
khal list 12/06/2026 15/06/2026  # specific date range
khal new                        # create a new event interactively
khal at                         # what's happening right now
khal edit -d "12/06/2026" "Event Title"  # interactively edit/delete an event
khal search "keyword"           # search events
```

**Deleting an event non-interactively:** khal has no `delete` subcommand. Instead, find the `.ics` file and remove it:

```bash
grep -rl "Event Title" ~/Calendars/personal/Personal/
rm /path/to/uid.ics
```

**Deleting a recurring event:** same approach — find the `.ics` containing the `RRULE` and delete it. All instances will vanish.

The underlying sync is done by vdirsyncer. (DAVx5 handles sync on Android.) The vdir is at `~/Calendars/personal/`.

**Cache bust:** khal caches events in `~/.cache/khal/khal.db` and won't pick up manual `.ics` edits. Delete the cache after editing `.ics` files directly:

```bash
rm ~/.cache/khal/khal.db
```

## Notes (`~/Atelier/notes`)

Plain markdown files. Key locations:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/Atelier/notes/TODO` | Main working todo (plain text, not a vdir todo) |
| `~/Atelier/notes/Elisa/` | Advisor meeting notes, dated `YYYY-MM-DD.md` |
| `~/Atelier/notes/old/` | Archived/older notes |
| `~/Atelier/notes/old/very-old/` | Ancient notes, GELOS, classes, etc. |

The Elisa notes typically have `# Pre` (agenda) and `# Post` (action items) sections.

The `~/Atelier/notes/old/todo.md` file has a dated task breakdown (work, masters, GELOS, personal).

The notes directory is a jj (Jujutsu) repo. Always run `jj new` before making any edits there — same workflow as any other jj repo. Use `jj` for all VCS operations, never `git`.

## Contacts (khard)

khard is a CardDAV address book client. Contacts are synced via vdirsyncer.

**To look up a contact, always use `khard show <name>` first.** It handles fuzzy matching and gives you everything (email, phone, notes, UID) in one shot. Only fall back to grep on `~/Contacts/Main/` for bulk operations or when khard misbehaves.

```bash
khard show <name>             # full contact details (phone, address, notes, etc.) — use this first
khard emails                  # list all contacts that have email addresses
khard list                    # list all contacts
```

### Editing contacts

`khard edit <name>` opens the contact in `$EDITOR`, but requires a TTY and may not work from within opencode. The fallback is to edit the vCard file directly:

```bash
# Find the vCard by UID (shown in khard show output under Miscellaneous > UID)
file=~/Contacts/Main/<UID>.vcf
```

Or grep for the name:

```bash
grep -rl "<name>" ~/Contacts/Main/
```

Then edit the `.vcf` file directly. `NOTE:` is the notes field.

## Email (~/Mail)

Mail lives in `~/Mail/` as a Maildir. Each account gets a subdirectory:

| Path | Account |
|---|---|
| `~/Mail/personal/` | hi@m7.rs (forwards from gabriel@gsfontes.com) |
| `~/Mail/usp/` | g.fontes@usp.br |

### Maildir layout

Standard Maildir: `Inbox/{cur,new,tmp}` plus `Archive/`, `Drafts/`, `Junk/`, `Sent/`, `Trash/`.

**Syncing:** mbsync syncs automatically via a systemd timer. To force an immediate sync:
```bash
systemctl --user start mbsync
```

All mail in `new/` has already been synced by mbsync — `new/` and `cur/` both contain read mail. Email files are named like:

```
<unix_ts>.<seq>_<host>,U=<uid>:2,<flags>
```

**Flags** (appended after `:2,`):
| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `S` | Seen (read) |
| `F` | Flagged (important/starred) |
| `R` | Replied |

Flags can combine, e.g. `,FRS` = Flagged + Replied + Seen.

**Moving files between mailboxes:** Always strip the `,U=<uid>` portion from the filename when moving a file to a different Maildir folder (e.g. Inbox to Archive). Otherwise the UID can clash with an existing file in the destination, causing mbsync to error out with "duplicate UID". mbsync will assign a fresh UID on the next sync.

```bash
# Strip UID before moving:
f="${src##*/}" && mv "$src" "$dest/${f//,U=[0-9]*:/:}"
```

### Reading email — workflow

1. **Get an overview first.** Use `grep` across `Inbox/cur/` for `^Subject:`, `^From:`, and `^Date:` to survey what's there before reading bodies.

2. **Check file size before reading.** Some emails contain huge base64-encoded attachments (especially .docx, PDFs, images). Use `read` on the directory to see file sizes (listed in the entries view), then use `limit` when reading to avoid dumping megabytes of base64. Emails with attachments often stretch to 500+ lines.

3. **Read with the Read tool, not cat.** Use `read` with `limit` — start with `limit=160` to grab headers + the beginning of the body. Expand if needed.

4. **Look for `text/plain` first.** Most emails are `multipart/alternative` with both `text/plain` and `text/html`. Read the `charset="UTF-8"` plaintext section — it contains the actual message without HTML soup. The boundary marker is like `--000000000000...`. Skip past the headers to find the `Content-Type: text/plain;` block.

5. **Decode base64 oneliners.** Some emails encode the entire body as base64 (no multipart). The `read` tool renders these as-is, but you can pipe through `base64 -d` in a pinch.

6. **Quoted-printable.** Most plaintext sections use `Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable`. The Read tool handles this natively — `=C3=A7` renders as `ç`, `=C2=A0` as NBSP, etc.

7. **Flagged emails are worth highlighting.** When summarizing, call out emails with `F` in the flags — Gabs intentionally marks these as important.

8. **Sort order.** Files sort by the Unix timestamp prefix in the filename, so `ls` order is chronological.

### Example: reading all inbox email

```bash
# Step 1: overview
grep '^Subject:' ~/Mail/personal/Inbox/cur/*
grep '^Subject:' ~/Mail/usp/Inbox/cur/*

# Step 2: check sizes, then read
read ~/Mail/personal/Inbox/cur/ <-- check file sizes
read ~/Mail/personal/Inbox/cur/<file> limit=160  <-- read one

# Step 3: expand if needed
read ~/Mail/personal/Inbox/cur/<file> offset=161 limit=200
```

### Sending email

Gabs uses a desktop email client. To compose a new message, use:

```bash
handlr open mailto:<address>
```

This opens the client's compose window pre-filled with the recipient. For a blank compose window, omit the address:

```bash
handlr open mailto:
```

### Drafts and Sent

- `~/Mail/personal/Sent/cur/`
- `~/Mail/usp/Sent/cur/`

These use the same Maildir layout. Read them the same way.
