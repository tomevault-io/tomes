# RuneLite Query

Use the read-only API at `http://127.0.0.1:18471`. It observes gameplay but cannot perform actions.

Before an unfamiliar request, confirm RuneLite and the plugin are running and inspect the on-demand API description:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:18471/v1/health | jq
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:18471/v1/openapi.json | jq '.paths'
```

Query endpoints directly with `curl`; compose results with `jq`. Repeated query parameters select multiple values:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:18471/v1/context | jq
curl -fsS 'http://127.0.0.1:18471/v1/skills?name=Herblore&name=Prayer' | jq
curl -fsS 'http://127.0.0.1:18471/v1/stored-items?container=bank&query=rune&limit=20' | jq
```

Treat `loading`, `logged_out`, `unavailable`, `observed`, `stale`, `partial`, and truncation metadata literally. Never present unavailable or cached data as current. Event cursors are generation-bound; follow the cursor fields returned by `/v1/events` rather than inventing sequence numbers.
