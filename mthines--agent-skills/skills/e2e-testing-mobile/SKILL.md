# E2E Testing — Mobile (Expo / React Native)

Drive native mobile end-to-end tests through Maestro and Maestro MCP.
The user writes (or approves) a Markdown feature spec; an agent emits a
Maestro YAML flow, runs it against a simulator or Maestro Cloud, and
self-heals when locators drift.

This is the **mobile** counterpart to [`e2e-testing`](../e2e-testing/SKILL.md).
Anything orthogonal to native (web flows, WebViews inside a hybrid app)
defers to that skill.
The two skills compose; they do not overlap.

> **This `SKILL.md` is a thin index.**
> Decision rules live in [`rules/*.md`](./rules) and load on demand.
> Worked references (Maestro CLI surface, MCP tool catalog, EAS Workflow
> wiring, Detox legacy notes, mobile pyramid math) live in
> [`references/*.md`](./references).
> Literal boilerplate the skill emits lives in
> [`templates/*.md`](./templates).
> Do not preload everything — load only what the current phase asks for.

## When to use

Reach for this skill when any of the following is true:

- An Expo or React Native app needs E2E coverage of a native user flow.
- A bug only repros across native navigation, deep links, push,
  permissions prompts, or a real device sensor.
- A flake needs a Maestro heal pass instead of a manual locator hunt.
- The repo has no `.maestro/` flows or EAS E2E build profile yet and
  needs Phase 0 setup.

Do **not** reach for this skill when:

- A unit or component test would catch the same bug — defer to
  [`tdd`](../../quality/tdd/SKILL.md) and the layer rule in
  [`rules/layer-decision.md`](./rules/layer-decision.md).
- The flow is browser-only — defer to
  [`e2e-testing`](../e2e-testing/SKILL.md).
- The flow lives entirely inside a WebView in a hybrid app — defer to
  [`e2e-testing`](../e2e-testing/SKILL.md), which automates the WebView
  via Playwright while Maestro handles native chrome around it.
- The change is a pure refactor with no behavioural surface.

---

## Phase 0 — Preflight (mandatory gate)

Before any agent loop, verify the repo is wired for Maestro on Expo / RN.
Halt and ask the user before installing anything or producing builds.

Run these checks (read-only):

```bash
# 1. Maestro CLI installed?
maestro --version 2>/dev/null

# 2. Flow directory present?
ls -d .maestro 2>/dev/null

# 3. EAS build profile for E2E exists?
jq '.build | has("e2e")' eas.json 2>/dev/null

# 4. Simulator / emulator available?
xcrun simctl list devices available 2>/dev/null | grep -E 'iPhone'
adb devices 2>/dev/null

# 5. Existing Detox install (legacy escape hatch)?
jq '.devDependencies | has("detox")' package.json 2>/dev/null
```

Decision table:

| State                                                       | Action                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Maestro CLI present + `.maestro/` exists + `eas.json` `e2e` profile | Proceed to Phase 1.                                                |
| Maestro CLI missing                                         | **Halt.** Print install plan ([`templates/install-plan.md`](./templates/install-plan.md)). Ask permission. |
| `.maestro/` missing                                         | **Halt.** Propose creating `.maestro/` with the [`templates/flow.yaml`](./templates/flow.yaml) starter. Ask first. |
| `eas.json` `e2e` build profile missing                      | **Halt.** Propose [`templates/eas-build-profile.json`](./templates/eas-build-profile.json). Ask first.            |
| No simulator / emulator running                             | **Halt.** Ask the user to boot one, or proceed with Maestro Cloud only.     |
| Existing Detox suite detected                               | Note it. Read [`references/detox-legacy.md`](./references/detox-legacy.md) before proposing migration. |
| Bare RN project (no `expo` / no `eas.json`)                 | Skip EAS-specific checks. Use Maestro CLI directly against a local build.   |

Print the exact commands; do not run them silently.
The full install plan template is in [`templates/install-plan.md`](./templates/install-plan.md).

---

## Phase 1 — Spec-first feature flow

The agent loop is **spec → emit-flow → run → heal**.
The spec is human-readable Markdown; the executable artefact is a
Maestro YAML flow.
Full rules: [`rules/spec-first-flow.md`](./rules/spec-first-flow.md).

```
specs/<flow>.md   ─┐
                   ├─→  emit  ─→  .maestro/<flow>.yaml  ─→  run  ─→  pass?
                   │                                                   │ no
                   │                                                   ▼
                   └─────────────────  heal  ←──────────────  failing flow + trace
                                          │
                                          ▼
                          patched flow or `testID` source-diff proposal
```

Two entry points:

1. **Spec already drafted by the user.**
   Skip exploration; emit the flow from `specs/<flow>.md`.
2. **App exists, no spec yet.**
   Run an exploratory pass against a running build (simulator) and
   draft `specs/<flow>.md`.
   The user reviews the Markdown before flow emission.

Use the Markdown template in
[`../e2e-testing/templates/spec.md`](../e2e-testing/templates/spec.md).
The spec format is identical across web and mobile — share it.

### Locator ladder for React Native (when generating or healing)

The Maestro flow walks the platform accessibility tree.
Pick locators in this order — never skip a rung:

1. `id: <testID>` — the source-of-truth selector for E2E.
   Mapped to `accessibilityIdentifier` on iOS and `resource-id` on
   Android (RN 0.64+). Stable across i18n and refactors.
2. `text: <visible string>` — only when the text is short, unique on
   screen, and not localised.
3. `accessibilityText: <label>` — last resort, with caveats.
   See [`rules/locator-strategy.md`](./rules/locator-strategy.md) for
   why `accessibilityLabel` should **not** double as a test selector.

`testID` is the standard fix, not an escape hatch.
When the Healer cannot find a stable element at rung 1, propose a
**source diff** that adds `testID` to the component (use the
`setTestId` helper in
[`templates/testid-helper.tsx`](./templates/testid-helper.tsx) to keep
iOS and Android consistent), and offer the diff for user approval
before patching the flow.
Full rules: [`rules/locator-strategy.md`](./rules/locator-strategy.md).

---

## Phase 2 — Token-aware execution

Maestro flows are YAML, not pixel snapshots — the per-step token cost
is already an order of magnitude below screenshot-driven runners.
Defaults the skill prescribes
(full rules: [`rules/token-budget.md`](./rules/token-budget.md)):

- Run only the changed flow on iteration: `maestro test .maestro/<flow>.yaml`.
- Use `--shards` only on Maestro Cloud, never on local iteration.
- `record_screen: false` by default; flip to `true` only when chasing a
  visual race.
- `retries: 1` for local, `retries: 2` for Maestro Cloud.
- Run the Healer **only on failure**, not on every save.
- Reuse a cached signed-in `app.app` / `app.apk` from the EAS E2E
  build profile — never rebuild on every flow run.
- Cap the heal loop at three attempts per failing flow before
  escalating.

---

## Phase 3 — Verification

After the agent emits a flow:

1. Run the flow once against a simulator or device.
   It must pass on first run, or the Healer must converge in ≤ 3 attempts.
2. Invoke [`test-provenance-guard`](../../quality/test-provenance-guard/SKILL.md) on
   any TypeScript helpers the flow imports (e.g. fixture builders) to
   ensure they call production code instead of a private re-implementation.
3. Open `.github/workflows/eas-e2e.yml` (or the EAS Workflow YAML) and
   confirm the `maestro-cloud` job is wired with `retries: 2` and
   `record_screen: false` per
   [`templates/eas-workflow.yaml`](./templates/eas-workflow.yaml).

If the heal loop fails to converge:

- Invoke `confidence(analysis)` on the flow failure.
- If confidence is below 90%, escalate to the user with the Maestro
  log, the spec, and the proposed locator changes — do **not** keep
  healing blindly.

| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bug fixable by a unit or component test                           | Use [`tdd`](../../quality/tdd/SKILL.md), not this skill.                                       |
| Flow is browser-only or pure web                                  | Use [`e2e-testing`](../e2e-testing/SKILL.md), not this skill.                       |
| Flow lives inside a WebView in a hybrid RN app                    | Pair with [`e2e-testing`](../e2e-testing/SKILL.md) for the WebView; Maestro for the native chrome. |
| Multi-screen native flow, deep links, permissions, or push        | Spec-first feature flow (Phase 1).                                                  |
| Flaky existing flow                                               | Healer pass only; do not rewrite without spec context.                              |
| Locator unstable, no stable `testID`                              | Propose `testID` diff via the `setTestId` helper.                                   |
| Repo missing Maestro CLI or `.maestro/` or `eas.json` E2E profile | Phase 0 halt + ask permission.                                                      |
| Heal loop > 3 attempts                                            | Stop, run `confidence(analysis)`, escalate.                                     |
| Flow passes on first run, never seen failing                      | Verify any imported helpers via `test-provenance-guard` before declaring done.      |
| Existing Detox suite is green and stable                          | Keep it; see [`references/detox-legacy.md`](./references/detox-legacy.md).          |
| Detox suite is brittle through RN upgrades                        | Migrate flow-by-flow to Maestro; do not rewrite the whole suite at once.            |

## Composes with

- [`e2e-testing`](../e2e-testing/SKILL.md) — owns web E2E and the
  WebView half of hybrid mobile apps. This skill defers to it for
  anything browser-shaped.
- [`tdd`](../../quality/tdd/SKILL.md) — owns the unit and component layers
  (Jest + React Native Testing Library). This skill defers for
  anything below E2E.
- [`test-provenance-guard`](../../quality/test-provenance-guard/SKILL.md) — runs
  on TypeScript helpers imported by flows to catch tests-by-construction.
- [`confidence`](../../quality/confidence/SKILL.md) — gate when the heal loop fails.
- [`holistic-analysis`](../../analysis/holistic-analysis/SKILL.md) — if a flow is
  failing for reasons no flow rewrite can fix, step back instead of
  patching.
- [`ux`](../../design/ux/SKILL.md) — review accessibility labels separately from
  test IDs (the two should never share a value).

## Anti-patterns (one-liner — full list in [`rules/anti-patterns.md`](./rules/anti-patterns.md))

- Writing E2E for logic a unit or RNTL component test catches.
- Reusing `accessibilityLabel` as the test selector (it is for screen
  readers; doubling its purpose breaks accessibility).
- Patching the flow with absolute coordinates (`tapOn: { point: "50%, 80%" }`)
  instead of proposing a `testID` diff.
- Running the Healer on every save, or on a passing flow.
- Rebuilding the `.app` / `.apk` on every flow run.
- Generating flows against a stub server, not the real app stack.
- Migrating a stable Detox suite all at once instead of flow-by-flow.

---

## Definition of done

- [ ] Phase 0 preflight passed or installs were user-approved.
- [ ] `specs/<flow>.md` exists and the user reviewed it.
- [ ] `.maestro/<flow>.yaml` passes against a real build.
- [ ] Any imported TS helpers pass `test-provenance-guard`.
- [ ] EAS Workflow `maestro-cloud` job runs the flow on Cloud with
      `retries: 2` and `record_screen: false`.
- [ ] If a `testID` was added, it is in the source diff and committed,
      with no `accessibilityLabel` reuse.
