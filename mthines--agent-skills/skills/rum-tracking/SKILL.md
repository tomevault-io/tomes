# RUM Tracking

Guides product-analytics and RUM event tracking for web (React/Next.js)
and mobile (React Native/Expo) apps.
Decides what to capture, what to drop, what's PII, and how to add, audit,
update, and remove tracking code without breaking downstream dashboards.

> **External dependency.** The OTel guidance in [`rules/otel-conventions.md`](./rules/otel-conventions.md)
> builds on the `otel-instrumentation` and `otel-semantic-conventions` skills,
> which live in the [dash0 agent-skills repo](https://github.com/dash0hq/agent-skills),
> not this one. That rule **invokes them at runtime via `Skill()` when they're
> installed** (and skips silently otherwise) — install them alongside this skill
> to get their authoritative span/metric/attribute guidance.

> **This `SKILL.md` is a thin index.**
> Detailed rules live in `rules/*.md` and load on demand.
> Worked examples live in `references/*.md`.
> Literal scaffolding lives in `templates/*.md`.

## Mode Detection

Parse `$1` as the mode.
State the detected mode in one line before continuing.

| Mode        | Default | Trigger                                                              |
| ----------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `guide`     | **yes** | "what should I track", "is this worth tracking", default if no mode  |
| `implement` |         | "add tracking", "instrument this", "track this event"                |
| `audit`     |         | "audit tracking", "review analytics", "find tracking issues"         |
| `remove`    |         | "remove tracking", "delete this event", "deprecate", "/rm-tracking"  |
| `plan`      |         | "tracking plan", "design event schema", "what events do we need"     |

If `$1` is a target file or directory, treat it as the scope for `audit`,
`implement`, or `remove`.

## Workflow by Mode

### Guide mode (default)

The user is deciding *whether* and *what* to track at a specific point.

1. Load [`rules/what-to-track.md`](./rules/what-to-track.md) and
   [`rules/what-not-to-track.md`](./rules/what-not-to-track.md).
2. Cross-check the proposal against
   [`rules/pii-and-compliance.md`](./rules/pii-and-compliance.md).
3. Recommend an event name + property set using
   [`rules/event-design.md`](./rules/event-design.md).
4. If the project uses OpenTelemetry RUM (Dash0 SDK Web, OTel browser /
   mobile, Embrace), also apply
   [`rules/otel-conventions.md`](./rules/otel-conventions.md).
5. Surface canonical events from
   [`references/event-catalog.md`](./references/event-catalog.md) instead
   of inventing new ones when one fits.

### Implement mode

The user wants tracking code written.

1. Confirm the event is in the tracking plan
   ([`rules/tracking-plan.md`](./rules/tracking-plan.md)).
   If not, propose adding it to the plan **first** and gate the user
   before writing instrumentation.
2. Pick the platform:
   - Web (React/Next.js) → [`rules/implementation-web.md`](./rules/implementation-web.md).
   - Mobile (React Native/Expo) → [`rules/implementation-mobile.md`](./rules/implementation-mobile.md).
3. If using OpenTelemetry, also load
   [`rules/otel-conventions.md`](./rules/otel-conventions.md).
4. All tracking calls must go through the centralized wrapper
   ([`templates/analytics-wrapper.template.ts`](./templates/analytics-wrapper.template.ts)).
   Never call the vendor SDK directly from a component.
5. Run the PII gate from
   [`rules/pii-and-compliance.md`](./rules/pii-and-compliance.md) on every
   property before the diff is final.

### Audit mode

The user wants existing tracking reviewed.

1. Walk the checklist in
   [`rules/audit-checklist.md`](./rules/audit-checklist.md).
2. For every finding, cite a file path and line number.
3. Group findings into: blocking (PII / consent / compliance), important
   (drift / ghost events / cardinality), nice-to-have (naming consistency).
4. Output a ranked fix list — do not auto-edit unless the user approved a
   pre-defined audit scope.

### Remove mode

The user wants tracking deprecated or deleted.

1. Apply the lifecycle in
   [`rules/update-and-remove.md`](./rules/update-and-remove.md).
2. Find every callsite via the centralized wrapper's typed event names.
3. Identify downstream consumers (dashboards, funnels, dbt models,
   cohorts) before deletion.
4. Mark `deprecated` first, set a sunset date, then remove.
5. Update the tracking plan and the inventory in the same PR.

### Plan mode

The user wants to design, update, or codegen a tracking plan.

1. Apply the structure in
   [`rules/tracking-plan.md`](./rules/tracking-plan.md).
2. Start from
   [`templates/tracking-plan.template.yaml`](./templates/tracking-plan.template.yaml).
3. Choose a naming school ([`rules/event-design.md`](./rules/event-design.md))
   and freeze it for the project.
4. Wire codegen (Avo, RudderTyper, Typewriter, or hand-rolled
   `json-schema-to-typescript`) so the wrapper is type-checked.

## Required Reading by Mode

Load on demand — do not preload.

| Mode        | Files                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `remove`    | [`rules/update-and-remove.md`](./rules/update-and-remove.md), [`rules/tracking-plan.md`](./rules/tracking-plan.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `plan`      | [`rules/tracking-plan.md`](./rules/tracking-plan.md), [`rules/event-design.md`](./rules/event-design.md), [`templates/tracking-plan.template.yaml`](./templates/tracking-plan.template.yaml)                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

[`references/platforms.md`](./references/platforms.md) is optional — load
when the user asks "which platform should we use" or names a specific
vendor.

## Core Principles

1. **The tracking plan is the source of truth.**
   Every event must exist in the plan before it exists in code.
2. **Centralized wrapper, never raw SDK calls.**
   One module owns every `track()` callsite; swapping vendors must be a
   single-file change.
3. **Type-safe events.**
   Use codegen (Avo, RudderTyper, Typewriter) or a hand-rolled
   discriminated union so renames break the build.
4. **PII never appears in event properties.**
   Use opaque `user.id`, hash for correlation, strip URLs and free-text.
5. **Low-cardinality event names; rich, bounded properties.**
   ≤ 30 event names in a typical app; high-value context in properties.
6. **Defer sampling to the pipeline.**
   SDKs export everything; the Collector or platform decides what to
   keep.
7. **OpenTelemetry semantic conventions when present.**
   `user.id`, `session.id`, `browser.*`, `app.*`, `error.type` come from
   the registry — do not invent custom names that overlap.
8. **Remove tracking the same way you add it.**
   Plan first, deprecate, find consumers, then delete.

## Anti-patterns (one-liners)

- Scattering `posthog.capture()` / `mixpanel.track()` calls across
  components instead of one wrapper.
- Tracking every hover, scroll, or render — drowns signal, explodes cost.
- Putting email, full URLs with tokens, raw `req.body`, or stack traces
  with user input into event properties.
- Using email or username as `distinct_id` / `user.id` — always opaque.
- Naming events inconsistently (`signup` and `user_registered` for the
  same concept).
- Deleting an event before checking which dashboards consume it.
- Configuring SDK-side sampling — sample in the Collector instead.
- Treating hashed email as anonymous — it remains personal data under
  GDPR.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Mode detected and stated.
- [ ] Required reading for the mode loaded.
- [ ] If `implement` or `remove`: tracking plan updated in the same diff.
- [ ] PII gate run on every new or modified event.
- [ ] Centralized wrapper used; no raw SDK calls in feature code.
- [ ] Downstream consumers identified before removal.
- [ ] Recommendation cites file paths and line numbers, or proposes a
      concrete diff.
