# JSON Schema → Pydantic v2 (lungo)

## What this skill does

Generates one Pydantic v2 module per JSON Schema in `coffeeAGNTCY/coffee_agents/lungo/schema/jsonschemas/*.json` and one matching pytest module per generated types module. Output:

- Types: `coffeeAGNTCY/coffee_agents/lungo/schema/types/<schema_name>.py` (no `_v<N>` suffix).
- Tests: `coffeeAGNTCY/coffee_agents/lungo/tests/unit/schemas/types/test_<schema_name>.py` (same stem as the types module, prefixed with `test_`, parallel to the `schema/types/` layout).
- The package `__init__.py` under `schema/types/` is updated to re-export the public symbols.

The generator is the schema. **Do not** read existing files in `schema/types/` or `tests/unit/schemas/types/test_<module>.py` to decide naming, layout, or behaviour - they may be missing, stale, or wrong. The only authoritative inputs are:

1. The `.json` files under `schema/jsonschemas/` (excluding `examples/`).
2. The example payloads under `schema/jsonschemas/examples/` — used as round-trip baselines and as the source data that test mutations clone before invalidating.
3. Cross-field validation logic that isn't expressible in JSON Schema, found in `coffeeAGNTCY/coffee_agents/lungo/schema/json_schema.py` (and any sibling modules under `schema/`).

## Workflow

Copy this checklist and tick items as you go:

```
- [ ] 1. Enumerate input schemas under schema/jsonschemas/*.json (skip examples/)
- [ ] 2. Read each schema fully, including $defs, $ref, allOf, anyOf, propertyNames
- [ ] 3. Read schema/json_schema.py for Python-only constraints (e.g. validate_version_specific_criteria)
- [ ] 4. Generate one schema/types/<name>.py per schema, applying the mapping rules
- [ ] 5. Update schema/types/__init__.py: re-export every public class, type alias, and `*_from_uuid` helper
- [ ] 6. Generate one tests/unit/schemas/types/test_<name>.py per types module, applying the test-generation rules
- [ ] 7. Look for possibly affected non-generated consumer code and update it
- [ ] 8. Run: cd coffeeAGNTCY/coffee_agents/lungo && uv run --frozen pytest tests/unit/schemas/ -x
- [ ] 9. Run: cd coffeeAGNTCY/coffee_agents/lungo && uv run --frozen pytest tests/unit/ -x
```

If step 8 or 9 fails, identify which mapping rule(s) or test-generation rule(s) you applied incorrectly and **re-emit** the affected file(s) end-to-end — do not patch the failing portion in isolation.  
If a rule itself seems wrong or insufficient to make the tests pass, surface that to the user instead of working around it.

## Naming

| Source artefact | Target Python identifier |
|---|---|
| `event_v1.json` | `schema/types/event.py` and `tests/unit/schemas/types/test_event.py` (strip the `_v<N>` version suffix) |
| `$defs.foo_bar` | `class FooBar` (snake_case → PascalCase, **no semantic renames**) |
| Top-level object schema with `title: "Event (v1)"` | `class Event` (title without parenthesised version) |
| Top-level schema with no root `type` (enum-only / `$defs`-only file, e.g. `event_type_v1.json`) | no root class — the module just contains the `$defs` outputs |
| `$defs.<x>_id` referencing `<prefix>://<UUID>` strings | `class <X>Id(RootModel[str])` + helper `<x>_id_from_uuid` |
| Cross-schema `$ref` (e.g. `event_type_v1.json#/$defs/event_type`) | `from schema.types.<other_module> import <Class>` |
| Enum member name | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE of the value, even when the value itself is PascalCase. Example: `RECRUITER_NODE_SEARCH = "RecruiterNodeSearch"`. |

The class name is derived **mechanically** from the `$defs` key. Do not shorten, expand, or reinterpret the name. You should, however, translate it from snake_case to PascalCase. For example, `stable_agent_id` becomes `StableAgentId`, never `AgentId`. If a consumer breaks because of a rename, that's the consumer's bug to fix, not the skill's.

### Naming for *merged* classes (anyOf branches that compose ≥2 `$defs`)

Whenever an `anyOf` branch is an `allOf` that references **two or more** `$defs`, that branch produces a *merged* leaf class with no `$def` name of its own. The rule applies regardless of where the branch sits in the `anyOf` (schemas are human-written; ordering is not a contract) and regardless of how many `$defs` are composed.

For each unique composition, pick a name that:

- Reads naturally as *base concept* "with" *extension(s)*, drawing the tokens from the composed `$def` keys.
- PascalCase-joins the components, deduplicating any common prefix/suffix shared between the keys so the result does not stutter (prefer `PartialNodeWithAgentExtension` over `PartialNodeWithPartialNodeAgentExtension`).
- Treats one of the composed `$defs` as the *base* and the rest as *extensions*. The base is most easily identified as the `$def` that another branch in the same `anyOf` references alone (or with fewer extensions). Falling back: pick the `$def` with the largest field set, or the one whose name does not look extension-shaped (e.g. lacks an `_extension` / `_ext` suffix).
- For ≥2 extensions, chain them: `<Base>With<Ext1>And<Ext2>...`. If the chain becomes unreadable, pick a domain-meaningful umbrella token instead — record the choice in the class docstring.

The merged class name must be a function of the *set* of composed `$defs`, not of the branch position. Two branches that compose the same set must resolve to the same class.

A `$def` that is **only** ever referenced inside an `allOf` composing a merged class is **not** emitted as a standalone class: its fields appear directly on the merged class instead. If the same `$def` is also referenced standalone elsewhere in the schema, emit it standalone too.

This rule applies whenever the composition is anonymous. If the schema gives the composition its own `$def` name (as `partial_agent_node` / `agent_node` do in `event_v1.json`), follow the standard naming rule and emit classes named after that key — see [`mapping-rules.md`](mapping-rules.md) §D for how the named-composition case interacts with sibling-key discrimination.

Use `from __future__ import annotations` and group imports stdlib → third-party → first-party (`schema.*`).

## Mapping rules

| Schema construct | Pydantic v2 emission |
|---|---|
| `type: string`, `pattern: P` | `Annotated[str, Field(pattern=P)]` |
| `type: string`, `minLength: 1` | `Annotated[str, Field(min_length=1)]` |
| `type: string`, `format: date-time` | `pydantic.AwareDatetime` |
| `type: string`, `enum: [...]` | `class X(StrEnum): ...` (preserve string values verbatim) |
| `type: number`, `default: V` | `float = V` |
| `type: boolean`, `default: V` | `bool = V` |
| `type: object`, `additionalProperties: false` | `model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid")` |
| `type: object`, `additionalProperties: true` (or unspecified for an extensible object) | `model_config = ConfigDict(extra="allow")` |
| Required field | bare type, no default |
| Optional field, no default | `<Type> \| None = None` |
| Optional field with `default: V` | `<Type> = V` (no `\| None`) |
| `$ref: "#/$defs/foo"` | use the generated `Foo` class as the field type |
| `$ref: "<other>_v<N>.json#/$defs/foo"` | import `Foo` from `schema.types.<other>` |
| Top-level schema `additionalProperties: false` | `Event` (or equivalent root) gets `extra="forbid"` |

### Rule A — Encode in-place schema constraints in the field type, preferably not in a validator

Anything that constrains a single value in isolation — `pattern`, `minLength`, `maximum`, `format`, `enum`, `propertyNames` on a dict — must be expressed in the field's `Annotated[...]` type. Validators (`@field_validator`, `@model_validator`) are **only** for cross-field constraints.

For `propertyNames: { $ref: "#/$defs/<id_def>" }` on a dict-shaped property, embed the constraint into the dict key annotation.
For example:

```python
instances: dict[
    Annotated[str, Field(pattern=_INSTANCE_ID_REGEX)], WorkflowInstance
]
```

See [`mapping-rules.md`](mapping-rules.md) §A for the full example.

### Rule B — `<prefix>://<UUID>` strings always pair `RootModel` with a `<def>_from_uuid` helper

For every `$defs.<x>_id` whose `pattern` matches `^<prefix>://<UUID>$`:

1. Emit `class <X>Id(RootModel[str])` with the `pattern=` constraint.
2. Emit `def <x>_id_from_uuid(<x>_uuid: UUID) -> <X>Id:` immediately below the class. Use `f"<prefix>://{<x>_uuid!s}"` to build the string.

Helper name is always `<schema_def_name>_from_uuid`, even if the prefix differs from the def name (e.g. `stable_agent_id` → prefix `agent://` → helper `stable_agent_id_from_uuid`).

### Rule C — `allOf [partial, {required: [...]}]` → standalone full class, not a subclass

When a `$def` is `allOf [partial_<X>, { required: [<all_fields>] }]`, generate **two unrelated** classes (`Partial<X>` and `<X>`) with their fields re-declared. Do not subclass: `Optional`/`| None` types from the partial would leak into the full form.

```python
class PartialThing(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(extra="allow")
    a: SomeType | None = None
    b: SomeType | None = None

class Thing(BaseModel):  # NOT (PartialThing) — fields are required here
    model_config = ConfigDict(extra="allow")
    a: SomeType
    b: SomeType
```

### Rule D — `anyOf` discriminated by sibling-key presence → `Discriminator` callable

When the `anyOf` branches differ by *which keys are present* (typically one branch has `not { anyOf: [{ required: [k1] }, { required: [k2] }, ...] }` and another `allOf`s in a sibling extension `$def` that requires those keys), encode the choice with a callable `pydantic.Discriminator` whose **only** job is to mirror that sibling-key presence test. Leave any *full vs. partial* sub-choice to Pydantic's smart union inside each branch.

```python
def _kind_discriminator(value: Any) -> str | None:
    if isinstance(value, (FullExt, PartialExt)):
        return "with_extension"
    if isinstance(value, (FullPlain, PartialPlain)):
        return "plain"
    if not isinstance(value, dict):
        return None
    if "ext_required_key" in value or "ext_optional_key" in value:
        return "with_extension"
    return "plain"

ItemUnion = Annotated[
    Union[
        Annotated[Union[FullPlain, PartialPlain], Tag("plain")],
        Annotated[Union[FullExt, PartialExt], Tag("with_extension")],
    ],
    Discriminator(_kind_discriminator),
]
```

Why this shape:

- The discriminator does **one** thing: encode the schema's actual `anyOf` decision. Never put field-count or per-field validity checks in it.
- Each tagged branch is a `Union[Full, Partial]`. Smart union picks `Full` when all the extra required fields are populated, else `Partial`.
- Bad inputs surface clean errors from the chosen branch's own `Field` / `pattern` constraints (e.g. `String should match pattern '^agent://...'`) instead of a custom "extra fields not allowed" message.
- Do **not** add an `@model_validator(mode="after")` that polices `__pydantic_extra__` for sibling-extension keys leaking into a non-extension variant. The discriminator already routes them to the right branch.

See [`mapping-rules.md`](mapping-rules.md) §D for the full worked example covering schemas with `not { required }` clauses.

### Rule E — Cross-field constraints from `schema/json_schema.py`

JSON Schema can't express "dict key X must equal nested value's `id` field" or similar relationships. Look in `coffeeAGNTCY/coffee_agents/lungo/schema/json_schema.py` for functions called from `validate_version_specific_criteria` (and any equivalent module). Each schema-name-gated check there must be re-implemented as a Pydantic `@model_validator(mode="after")`.

**Where to attach the validator**: place it on the *smallest* class that owns every field the check reads. Do not push it up to the root just because the source helper happens to start its traversal at the root.

Example: `_enforce_workflow_instance_map_key_id_match` reads `workflow.instances` keys and `workflow_instance.id`. Both live inside the `Workflow` class (the dict is its `instances` field; each value is a `WorkflowInstance` whose `id` it can dereference). So the validator goes on `Workflow`, not on `Event` or `Data`.

The validator's docstring must point back at the source helper, e.g.:

```
mirrors ``schema.json_schema._enforce_workflow_instance_map_key_id_match``
```

## `__init__.py` regeneration

`schema/types/__init__.py` re-exports every public symbol from each generated module. Keep three groups, each alphabetised:

1. Imports from each `schema.types.<module>`.
2. The `__all__` tuple/list in the same order as the imports.
3. A short module docstring noting that the modules under this package are generated by this skill and pointing at it.

Public symbols include: every `class` declared at module level, every type alias (e.g. `TopologyNodeItem`, `Node`, `PartialNode`), and every `<name>_from_uuid` helper.

## Test generation

For every generated `schema/types/<name>.py` emit a matching pytest module at `tests/unit/schemas/types/test_<name>.py` (the `tests/unit/schemas/types/` directory mirrors `schema/types/`). Very short and not meaningful types files don't need to have tests generated for them unless instructed by the user.  
These test files are owned by this skill: do not read the existing ones to decide layout; re-emit. However, if a file under `schema/types/<name>.py` has not changed, then don't generate a new test file for it, unless specifically instructed by the user.  
The goal of every test in these modules is to verify that the generated Pydantic types agree with both (a) the JSON Schema layer (`schema.validation.validate_data_against_schema`) and (b) the Python validation logic in `coffeeAGNTCY/coffee_agents/lungo/schema/json_schema.py` (and any sibling modules) that doesn't fit into JSON Schema — Pydantic `Discriminator` callables, `@model_validator` cross-field checks, and `@field_validator` whole-value checks should usually all live alongside the schema-driven cases in the same tables, if possible, not in separate "discriminator-only" or "validator-only" tables.

### File header and imports

Same license header and `Generated from ...` docstring shape as the types module, pointing at the source `.json`. Use `from __future__ import annotations` and group imports stdlib → third-party → first-party (`schema.*`).

Don't re-explain the rules from this SKILL used to generate the file. 

### Test pattern (table-driven, NamedTuple-keyed)

For every test function in the file:

1. Define a top-level `Case = NamedTuple` with `case_id: str` and one or two sub-NamedTuples (`Inputs`, optional `Outputs`). The top-level tuple is always the `Case` shape; only add `Outputs` when the expected result needs more than one field (e.g. distinguishing "valid" from "raises type X"). For tests where the expected result is fully derivable from the inputs (e.g. an id helper that always builds `f"{prefix}://{uuid}"`), `Outputs` may be omitted and the assertion derived from `inputs` directly.
2. Bring all parameters for that test into one `_<UPPERCASE>_CASES: tuple[<Case>, ...] = (...)` table. Multiple tables per file is the norm — one per concern (id helpers, id pattern enforcement, top-level model agreement, enum member values, parent-schema acceptance, etc.). Do not collapse heterogeneous concerns into a single table.
3. Parametrize with `@pytest.mark.parametrize("case", [pytest.param(c, id=c.case_id) for c in _<UPPERCASE>_CASES])` so the case id is the pytest test id.
4. Mutations on a loaded example can be named module-level functions, but if they are short and very simple they should be inline lambdas. If they are named functions, name them `_mutate_<case_id>` and declare them in a single block right above the table that references them. The test body deepcopies the example before invoking the mutation. (For round-trip cases, `inputs.mutate is None`; assert that in the test body so a future case can't accidentally combine "valid" with a mutation.)

### What to cover per artefact kind

The set of tables in a generated test module is a function of what the corresponding types module emits. Use the following recipe:

- **For every `class <X>Id(RootModel[str])` plus `<x>_id_from_uuid` helper**: there's no need to generate dedicated tests for these. They should be covered by cases in other types that use them.
- **For every `class <X>(StrEnum)`**: there's no need to generated dedicated tests for these. They should be covered by cases in other types that use them.
- **For every top-level model class** (`Event` etc.): one `_<MODEL>_CASES` table whose rows are either round-trip rows (every packaged example file under `schema/jsonschemas/examples/`, with no mutation) or invalidation rows (same example, with a mutation that violates a single named invariant). Cases must collectively cover, at minimum:
  - one case per packaged example (round-trip, no mutation),
  - one case per `additionalProperties: false` boundary the schema declares,
  - one case per `pattern` constraint reachable from the root (e.g. malformed `metadata.id`, malformed `metadata.correlation.id`),
  - one case per `enum` constraint reachable from the root (assigning an unknown member),
  - one case per top-level `required: [...]` field (deletion of the required key — this exercises both the JSON Schema `required` clause and Pydantic's "field required" error),
  - one case per cross-field invariant in `schema/json_schema.py` that the validator-rule rule (Rule E) implements as a Pydantic `@model_validator` (e.g. `instances` map key vs. nested `id`),
  - one case per `Discriminator` decision in the types module (input data that should route to each branch must already be exercised by the round-trip examples; if a packaged example doesn't cover both branches of a discriminator, add a focused round-trip row that does, using a deepcopy of an existing example mutated to flip the routing).

Round-trip body: validate via `validate_data_against_schema(data, "<schema_name>")`, then `<Model>.model_validate(data)`, then `dumped = model.model_dump(mode="json", exclude_none=True)`, then re-validate `dumped` through both layers. Also assert `isinstance(dumped[...], str)` for any `format: date-time` fields and that the corresponding `model.<...>.tzinfo is not None`.

Invalid body: assert that **both** `validate_data_against_schema` and `<Model>.model_validate` raise — typically `SchemaValidationError` and `pydantic.ValidationError` respectively. The `Outputs` sub-NamedTuple usually pins both exception types: `EventOutputs(schema_exc, model_exc)`. An invalid case where only one layer rejects the input is a bug in either the types module (Pydantic too lax/strict) or the schema (the JSON Schema doesn't encode the constraint and there's no Python `@model_validator` for it) — surface it to the user instead of writing a one-sided test.

### Anti-patterns specific to test generation

- ❌ Single table mixing id-helper rows with top-level-model rows. Tables are homogeneous; one table per test function.
- ❌ Module-level helpers with names that don't match the case id they serve (it makes case ↔ mutator mapping a manual diff).
- ❌ Asserting only one of the two validation layers. If a payload is invalid, both layers must reject it (use `pytest.raises` against each in sequence).
- ❌ Building round-trip payloads inline as Python literals when a packaged example exists. Load examples from `schema/jsonschemas/examples/` and mutate copies for invalidation rows.

## Verification

After generating, both must pass:

```
cd coffeeAGNTCY/coffee_agents/lungo
uv run --frozen pytest tests/unit/schemas/  # schema-layer tests + generated tests/unit/schemas/types/test_<module>.py
uv run --frozen pytest tests/unit/          # consumer compatibility
```

If a consumer fails because of a rename you introduced (e.g. it imported the old class name), report the failure to the user and ask before touching non-generated code.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Reading an existing `schema/types/<name>.py` to decide naming.
- ❌ Reading an existing `tests/unit/schemas/types/test_<name>.py` to decide layout — generated tests are re-emitted end-to-end from the schema and the corresponding types module.
- ❌ Subclassing `Partial<X>` from `<X>` (or vice versa) when `allOf` only adds required fields.
- ❌ Using `@model_validator(mode="after")` to police `__pydantic_extra__` for fields that should belong to a sibling union variant.
- ❌ Putting field-count or per-field validity checks inside a `Discriminator` callable. The discriminator answers exactly one question: which schema `anyOf` branch.
- ❌ Adding `@field_validator` for a constraint that fits in `Annotated[..., Field(...)]`.
- ❌ Inventing class names (`AgentId` for `stable_agent_id`, `Node` for `regular_node`). Names come straight from `$defs` keys.
- ❌ Hand-editing a small portion of the generated file in response to a test failure or a request for a tweak. Re-emit the whole file end-to-end via the skill instead — partial patches drift from the rules over time.
