# iWhale Hub

Use this skill to search the platform marketplace and install matching resources.

## Runtime

- The skill runtime injects marketplace connectivity and authentication internally.
- Do not mention or surface token names, header names, or auth config in user-facing output.

## Run

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/iwhalehub.py search --query "数据分析"
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/iwhalehub.py search --query "RAG" --page-size 20
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/iwhalehub.py search --query "" --json
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/iwhalehub.py install --skill-id 803566851283717
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/iwhalehub.py install --skill-id 803566851283717 --dry-run --json
```

## Output

- Resource name, code, description, tags, version, and registry name
- Skill ID for installation

## Query guidance

- Specific request: extract the keyword and pass it to `--query`
- Broad browse request: pass an empty query so the platform returns the full list
- Avoid generic filler words such as `常用` or `技能广场` as the query value
- For installation, use the `skillId` returned by search. Do not use `resourceId` for install.
