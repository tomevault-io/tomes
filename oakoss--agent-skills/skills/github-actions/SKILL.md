# GitHub Actions

## Overview

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that automates build, test, and deployment pipelines directly from GitHub repositories. Workflows are YAML files in `.github/workflows/` triggered by events like pushes, pull requests, schedules, or manual dispatch. Each workflow contains one or more jobs that run on GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runners.

**When to use:** Automated testing, continuous deployment, release automation, scheduled tasks, multi-platform builds, dependency updates, container publishing, code quality checks, security scanning.

**When NOT to use:** Long-running services (use a proper hosting platform), heavy compute tasks exceeding runner limits (6-hour job timeout), tasks requiring persistent state between runs (use external storage), real-time event processing (use webhooks with a server).

## Quick Reference

| Pattern             | Syntax / Action                                  | Key Points                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Push trigger        | `on: push: branches: [main]`                     | Filter by branch, path, or tag              |
| PR trigger          | `on: pull_request: types: [opened, synchronize]` | Defaults to opened, synchronize, reopened   |
| Scheduled trigger   | `on: schedule: - cron: '0 6 * * 1'`              | UTC only, minimum 5-minute interval         |
| Manual trigger      | `on: workflow_dispatch: inputs:`                 | Define typed inputs for manual runs         |
| Job dependencies    | `needs: [build, test]`                           | Run jobs in sequence or parallel            |
| Conditional job     | `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`            | Expression-based job/step filtering         |
| Matrix strategy     | `strategy: matrix: node: [18, 20, 22]`           | Generates jobs for each combination         |
| Dependency cache    | `actions/cache@v5`                               | Hash-based keys with restore-keys fallback  |
| Setup with cache    | `actions/setup-node@v6` with `cache: 'pnpm'`     | Built-in caching for package managers       |
| Upload artifact     | `actions/upload-artifact@v4`                     | Share data between jobs or preserve outputs |
| Download artifact   | `actions/download-artifact@v4`                   | Retrieve artifacts from earlier jobs        |
| Reusable workflow   | `uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable.yml`         | Called with `workflow_call` trigger         |
| Composite action    | `action.yml` with `using: composite`             | Bundle multiple steps into one action       |
| Concurrency         | `concurrency: group: ${{ github.ref }}`          | Cancel or queue duplicate runs              |
| Environment secrets | `${{ secrets.API_KEY }}`                         | Scoped to repo, org, or environment         |
| OIDC authentication | `permissions: id-token: write`                   | Short-lived tokens for cloud providers      |
| Step outputs        | `echo "key=value" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"`           | Pass data between steps and jobs            |
| Service containers  | `services: postgres: image: postgres:16`         | Sidecar containers for integration tests    |
| Timeout             | `timeout-minutes: 30`                            | Fail fast on hung jobs or steps             |
| Attestations        | `actions/attest-build-provenance@v3`             | SLSA build provenance for supply chain      |

## Expressions and Contexts

| Context   | Example                         | Description                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `github`  | `github.ref_name`, `github.sha` | Event metadata, repo info, actor          |
| `env`     | `env.NODE_ENV`                  | Environment variables at current scope    |
| `secrets` | `secrets.API_KEY`               | Encrypted secrets (masked in logs)        |
| `inputs`  | `inputs.environment`            | Workflow dispatch or reusable inputs      |
| `matrix`  | `matrix.node`                   | Current matrix combination values         |
| `steps`   | `steps.build.outputs.version`   | Outputs from previous steps               |
| `needs`   | `needs.prepare.outputs.tag`     | Outputs from dependent jobs               |
| `runner`  | `runner.os`, `runner.arch`      | Runner environment info                   |
| `vars`    | `vars.DEPLOY_URL`               | Repository or org configuration variables |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                      | Correct Pattern                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Using outdated action major versions         | Pin to current major version (`@v6`) or commit SHA                         |
| Missing `persist-credentials: false`         | Set on checkout when using custom tokens or OIDC                           |
| Broad `permissions` at workflow level        | Set `permissions: {}` at workflow level, grant per-job                     |
| Cache key without dependency file hash       | Include `hashFiles('**/pnpm-lock.yaml')` in cache key                      |
| Secrets in `if:` conditions                  | Secrets cannot be used in `if:` expressions directly                       |
| Using `pull_request_target` carelessly       | Never run PR code with write permissions from `pull_request_target`        |
| Not cancelling stale runs                    | Use `concurrency` with `cancel-in-progress: true`                          |
| Storing structured data as a single secret   | Create individual secrets per value for proper log redaction               |
| Referencing action tags without SHA pinning  | Pin third-party actions to full commit SHA for supply chain safety         |
| Hardcoding runner OS in scripts              | Use `runner.os` context for cross-platform compatibility                   |
| Using `actions/cache` without `restore-keys` | Always provide restore-keys for partial cache matches                      |
| Interpolating user input in `run:` blocks    | Pass untrusted values through `env:` to prevent script injection           |
| No `timeout-minutes` on jobs                 | Set explicit timeouts to fail fast on hung processes                       |
| Using `always()` without scoping             | Combine with status checks: `if: always() && steps.x.outcome == 'success'` |

## Delegation

- **Workflow debugging**: Use `Explore` agent to inspect workflow run logs
- **Security auditing**: Use `Task` agent to review permissions and secret usage
- **Code review**: Delegate to `code-reviewer` agent for workflow PR reviews
