# quark-torch-skill-sync

## Purpose

Audit upstream Quark source against the skill system's assumptions and report which skills or contracts need updates. This is important because Quark is actively developed — new quantization schemes, model architectures, CLI flags, and API changes can silently invalidate skill instructions. A skill that references a removed flag or an outdated version constraint will produce wrong guidance.

## Inputs

- Quark upstream source files
- Existing skill SKILL.md files

## Outputs: validation_report.md

Lists which skills or contracts need updates after a Quark upstream change.

Schema: [`validation_report.schema.json`](../../../shared/contracts/validation_report.schema.json)

## What to Check

### Source Knowledge Dependencies

Each skill declares `source_knowledge` files. Check that these files still exist and that the skill's content matches the current source:

| Skill | Source Files to Check |
|-------|----------------------|
| `quark-env-preflight` | `docs/source/install.rst`, `pyproject.toml` |
| `quark-torch-install` | `tools/ci/install_torch.sh`, `docs/source/install.rst` |
| `quark-install` | `docs/source/install.rst`, `requirements.txt` |
| `quark-torch-model-intake` | `quark/torch/utils/llm/model_preparation.py`, `quark/torch/quantization/config/template.py` |
| `quark-torch-quant-plan` | `quark/torch/quantization/config/template.py`, `examples/torch/language_modeling/llm_ptq/README.md` |
| `quark-torch-export` | `quark/torch/export/api.py`, `examples/contrib/llm_eval/llm_eval.py` |
| `quark-torch-debug` | `quark/torch/utils/llm/compatibility.py`, `docs/source/install.rst` |
| `quark-torch-llm-ptq-workflow` | `examples/torch/language_modeling/llm_ptq/quantize_quark.py` |
| `quark-torch-llm-ptq-eval` | `examples/torch/language_modeling/llm_ptq/quantize_quark.py`, `examples/torch/language_modeling/llm_ptq/example_quark_torch_llm_ptq.rst` |

### Key Facts to Verify

1. **Supported Python versions** — check `pyproject.toml` `requires-python` field
2. **PyTorch version matrix** — check `tools/ci/install_torch.sh` for supported combinations
3. **Quantization schemes** — check `quark/torch/quantization/config/template.py` for the scheme list
4. **Supported model architectures** — check `quark/torch/utils/llm/model_preparation.py` for the model template list
5. **CLI arguments** — check `quantize_quark.py` argparse definitions for new/removed/changed flags
6. **Export formats** — check `quark/torch/export/api.py` for supported formats
7. **Compatibility checks** — check `quark/torch/utils/llm/compatibility.py` for transformer version constraints

### Drift Classification

- **Mechanical drift**: A version number changed, a flag was renamed, a new scheme was added. Fix is straightforward — update the affected table or list in the skill.
- **Semantic drift**: A workflow pattern changed, a concept was redefined, a behavior assumption is no longer true. Requires careful skill rewriting.
- **Breaking drift**: A skill references something that was removed entirely. The skill will produce wrong guidance until fixed.

## Audit Process

1. **Discover dependencies**: Read `source_knowledge` from each skill's frontmatter.
2. **Check for changes**: Compare the current source files against what the skills assume. Look for:
   - New entries not mentioned in skills (e.g., new quantization scheme)
   - Removed entries still mentioned in skills (e.g., deprecated flag)
   - Changed values (e.g., version constraint updated)
3. **Classify each drift**: mechanical, semantic, or breaking
4. **Report**: Produce a `validation_report.md` with the findings

## Rules

- **Do not auto-fix breaking drift** — report it and require human confirmation before applying changes.
- **Mechanical drift can be flagged for batch update** — version bumps and new scheme additions are safe to apply after review.
- **If no prior baseline exists**, run calibration mode: record the current state of all source files as the baseline for future comparisons.

## Summary
- Checked: 7 skills, 12 source files
- Mechanical drift: 3 findings
- Semantic drift: 0 findings
- Breaking drift: 1 finding

## Breaking Drift
### quark-install: Python version constraint changed
- **Skill says**: Python 3.11-3.13
- **Source says**: Python 3.11-3.14 (pyproject.toml updated)
- **Impact**: Users on Python 3.14 will be told it's unsupported when it is now supported
- **Fix**: Update Python version table in quark-install SKILL.md

## Mechanical Drift
### quark-torch-quant-plan: New scheme added
- **Source**: template.py now includes `nvfp4` scheme
- **Impact**: Users asking about NVFP4 won't see it in the scheme list
- **Fix**: Add `nvfp4` row to the scheme table

### quark-torch-model-intake: New model template
- **Source**: model_preparation.py now supports `phi4`
- **Fix**: Add `phi4` to the supported models table
```

## Interaction Flow

1. **Collect**: Identify all source knowledge dependencies across skills.
2. **Audit**: Check each source file for changes relevant to skill content.
3. **Classify**: Tag each finding as mechanical, semantic, or breaking.
4. **Report**: Present findings in a structured report.
5. **Confirm**: Get approval before applying any fixes.

## Recovery

- If a source file no longer exists (was moved or deleted), this is breaking drift. Report the missing file and suggest where the information might have moved to.
- If the upstream repository is not accessible, report the blocked audit and which skills could not be verified.
