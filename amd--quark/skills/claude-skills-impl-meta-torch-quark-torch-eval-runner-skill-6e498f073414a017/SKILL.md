# quark-torch-eval-runner

## Purpose

Walk a maintainer through manual verification of the skill system across the four contract categories: routing, planning, artifact, and recovery. Run this after modifying any skill, after a Quark upgrade, or before tagging a release.

## Inputs

- The current skill files under `.claude/skills-impl/`
- The entry stubs under `.claude/skills/`
- The contract schemas under `.claude/skills-impl/shared/contracts/`
- The example prompts under `examples/agent_skills/prompts/`

## Outputs: validation_report.md

A markdown report recording per-category pass/fail and concrete evidence for each finding.

Schema: [`validation_report.schema.json`](../../../shared/contracts/validation_report.schema.json)

```markdown
# Skill Verification Report

## Summary
| Category | Cases Run | Pass | Fail |
|----------|-----------|------|------|
| routing  | N         | N    | 0    |
| planning | N         | N    | 0    |
| artifact | N         | N    | 0    |
| recovery | N         | N    | 0    |

## Manual Verification Protocol

For each category below, run **at least one case** and record the result in the report. The example prompts in `examples/agent_skills/prompts/` are good starting cases; add more as the skill set grows.

### 1. Routing

**Goal:** verify that `quark-torch-router` (and Claude's auto-routing via descriptions in `.claude/skills/`) maps natural-language goals to the correct downstream skill.

**Manual procedure:**

1. Pick a user-style prompt (e.g., from `examples/agent_skills/prompts/torch_llm_ptq.md` or a freshly invented one).
2. In a fresh Claude Code session at the Quark repo root, paste the prompt.
3. Observe which skill Claude invokes first.
4. Compare against the expected target skill. Examples of expected mappings:
   - "Quantize Llama-2-7B with FP8 and export to HuggingFace format" → `quark-torch-ptq` (which loads `quark-torch-llm-ptq-workflow`)
   - "What GPU do I have?" → `quark-env-preflight`
   - "pip install amd-quark fails" → `quark-install` or `quark-torch-debug`
   - "Convert my quantized model to GGUF" → `quark-torch-export`

**Pass criteria:** the first skill invoked matches the expected target.

### 2. Planning

**Goal:** verify that `quark-torch-quant-plan` produces internally consistent plans for typical inputs.

**Manual procedure:**

1. Construct (or take from a prior session) a `model_analysis.json` for a representative model (e.g., Qwen3-8B).
2. Hand it to `quark-torch-quant-plan` with a target scheme (e.g., `fp8`).
3. Inspect the produced `quant_plan.json` for:
   - `global_scheme` matches the requested scheme
   - `exclude_layers` is non-empty and includes `lm_head` for LLMs
   - No conflicting options (e.g., `kv_cache_dtype: fp8` requires the FP8 scheme path)
   - `requires_confirmation` is set when the plan deviates from defaults

**Pass criteria:** the plan validates against `quant_plan.schema.json` and contains no internal contradictions.

### 3. Artifact

**Goal:** verify that workflow output artifacts conform to their JSON schemas.

**Manual procedure:**

1. Take the `quant_plan.json` from the planning case.
2. Run `quark-torch-llm-ptq-workflow` to produce a `run_manifest.yaml`.
3. Validate the manifest against `.claude/skills-impl/shared/contracts/run_manifest.schema.json` (use any JSON-schema validator, e.g., the `jsonschema` Python package, or eyeball required fields).
4. Spot-check that:
   - All required fields are present
   - Referenced artifact paths exist or are clearly marked as to-be-produced
   - Export configuration is included (e.g., `export.formats`)

**Pass criteria:** schema validation passes; required fields are present and consistent.

### 4. Recovery

**Goal:** verify that `quark-torch-debug` correctly diagnoses known error patterns.

**Manual procedure:**

1. Pick a known error scenario. Examples:
   - `AttributeError: 'PreTrainedTokenizerFast' object has no attribute 'get_max_length'` (transformers version mismatch)
   - CUDA out-of-memory during a 70B-parameter quantization
   - Missing `lm_head` exclusion causing accuracy collapse
2. Present the error to `quark-torch-debug`.
3. Verify the diagnosis:
   - Root cause is correctly identified
   - A concrete fix command or config change is provided
   - The affected version range or environment condition is stated

**Pass criteria:** the diagnosis names the actual root cause and suggests a fix that would actually work.

## Rules

- **Run at least one case per category before any release** — even small wording changes can shift routing behavior.
- **A failing case means the skill is broken, not the procedure** — investigate the skill first. Only update the expected behavior if the skill change was intentional.
- **Report all results**, not just failures. A clean run is positive evidence and worth recording.
- **Document new cases inline in the report.** As the skill set grows, add cases that cover new triggers.

## Interaction Flow

1. **Select scope:** which categories to verify — all four, or a subset affected by a recent change?
2. **Pick or write cases:** use prompts from `examples/agent_skills/prompts/` or write minimal new ones.
3. **Run each case manually** following the protocol above.
4. **Record results** in `validation_report.md` using the template.
5. **Hand off failures** to `quark-torch-skill-sync` if they look like upstream drift, or directly to the affected skill's owner if it's a content bug.

## Recovery

- If a case can't run because a prerequisite artifact is missing (e.g., no `model_analysis.json` for the planning case), report the missing producer skill and stop — do not fabricate the input.
- If Claude Code itself is misbehaving (skill not discovered, stub not loading), that's an infrastructure issue separate from skill quality — record it distinctly in the report.
