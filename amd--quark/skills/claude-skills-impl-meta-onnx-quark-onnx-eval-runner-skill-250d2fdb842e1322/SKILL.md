# quark-onnx-eval-runner

## Purpose

Walk a maintainer through manual verification of the ONNX skill family across the four contract
categories: **routing**, **planning**, **artifact**, and **recovery**. Run this after modifying any
`quark-onnx-*` skill, after a Quark ONNX upgrade, or before tagging a release.

## Inputs

- The current ONNX skill files under `.claude/skills-impl/{l1-atomic,l2-workflows,l3-recipes}/onnx/`
- The entry stubs under `.claude/skills/quark-onnx-*`
- The contract schemas under `.claude/skills-impl/shared/contracts/`
- The example prompts under `examples/agent_skills/prompts/` (add ONNX-specific cases as the
  catalog grows)

## Outputs: validation_report.md

A markdown report recording per-category pass/fail and concrete evidence for each finding.

Schema: [`validation_report.schema.json`](../../../shared/contracts/validation_report.schema.json)

## Manual Verification Protocol

For each category below, run **at least one case** and record the result in the report. As ONNX
prompts are not yet enumerated in `examples/agent_skills/prompts/`, the cases below double as the
seed catalog — add more as the ONNX skill set grows.

### 1. Routing

**Goal:** verify that `quark-onnx-router` (and Claude's auto-routing via the descriptions in
`.claude/skills/quark-onnx-*`) maps natural-language ONNX goals to the correct downstream skill
and never silently routes ONNX requests through a torch skill.

**Manual procedure:**

1. Pick a user-style prompt that names a `.onnx` artifact or ONNX-specific vocabulary.
2. In a fresh Claude Code session at the Quark repo root, paste the prompt.
3. Observe which skill Claude invokes first.
4. Compare against the expected target skill. Examples of expected mappings:
   - "Quantize my `./models/yolov8n.onnx` to XINT8 for AMD NPU CNN" → `quark-onnx-ptq`
     (which loads `quark-onnx-ptq-workflow`)
   - "Run AutoSearchPro on this `.onnx` with the `XINT8_SEARCH` preset" → `quark-onnx-autosearch-pro`
   - "Analyze this `.onnx` — what opset is it, is it NPU-compatible, is it already QDQ?" →
     `quark-onnx-model-intake`
   - "Validate my quantized `model.onnx` — did QDQ insertion happen, are the non-quantized
     initializers byte-identical?" → `quark-onnx-result-validator`
   - "`onnxruntime-gpu` import fails, `CUDAExecutionProvider` not in providers list" →
     `quark-onnx-install` (or `quark-onnx-debug` if the user already attempted install)
   - "`quantize_static` failed with custom-op library load failure for `BFPQuantizeDequantize`"
     → `quark-onnx-debug`
   - "Is `onnxruntime-rocm` installed correctly? Show me the install matrix" → `quark-onnx-install`

5. **Cross-backend guard:** also run one **negative** prompt that mentions a `.onnx` path and
   confirm Claude does **not** route to `quark-torch-*` (e.g., "quantize `./models/foo.onnx` with
   FP8" must not land on `quark-torch-ptq`).

**Pass criteria:** the first skill invoked matches the expected target, and no ONNX prompt is
routed to a torch skill.

### 2. Planning

**Goal:** verify that `quark-onnx-quant-plan` produces internally consistent plans for typical
ONNX inputs and that the deployment-target gates are respected.

**Manual procedure:**

1. Construct (or take from a prior session) a `model_analysis.json` produced by
   `quark-onnx-model-intake` for a representative model (e.g., YOLOv8n exported at opset 17,
   Conv-heavy, 6.2 MB inline).
2. Hand it to `quark-onnx-quant-plan` with a target preset (e.g., `XINT8`) and a deployment
   target (e.g., `AMD NPU CNN`).
3. Inspect the produced `quant_plan.json` for:
   - `preset` matches the requested preset
   - `activation_spec` and `weight_spec` are consistent with the preset (e.g., both `XInt8Spec`
     for `XINT8`)
   - `EnableNPUCnn=True` is set when the target is AMD NPU CNN
   - `use_external_data_format` is `True` iff the model is >2 GB
   - `algo_config` is a non-empty list when CLE or AdaRound was requested or recommended
   - `exclude` is a list (may be empty) and never contains an op the plan also quantizes
   - `requires_confirmation` is set when the plan deviates from preset defaults
   - **Negative gate:** the plan refuses incompatible combos (e.g., `BFP16` + `AMD NPU CNN`)
     rather than silently downgrading

**Pass criteria:** the plan validates against `quant_plan.schema.json`, contains no internal
contradictions, and explicitly rejects unsupported deployment-target / preset combinations.

### 3. Artifact

**Goal:** verify that ONNX workflow output artifacts conform to their JSON schemas and that the
generated standalone script + manifest produced by `quark-onnx-ptq-workflow` agree with each
other.

**Manual procedure:**

1. Take the `quant_plan.json` from the planning case.
2. Run `quark-onnx-ptq-workflow` to produce a `run_manifest.yaml` and the standalone
   `<name>_ptq.py` script in the user's working directory.
3. Validate the manifest against `.claude/skills-impl/shared/contracts/run_manifest.schema.json`
   (use any JSON-schema validator, e.g., the `jsonschema` Python package).
4. Spot-check that:
   - All required fields are present in the manifest
   - The manifest's `command` references the generated script path and uses `python3`
   - The manifest's resolved `QConfig` matches the plan's `preset` / `algo_config` /
     `EnableNPUCnn` / `use_external_data_format`
   - The generated script imports only from `quark.onnx` and the standard ORT calibration API
     (no editing of upstream `examples/onnx/` or `quark/onnx/` files)
   - Output paths reflect any `.onnx_data` sidecar when external data is enabled

**Pass criteria:** schema validation passes; the manifest's resolved config matches the plan;
the generated script is self-contained in the user's working directory.

### 4. Recovery

**Goal:** verify that `quark-onnx-debug` correctly diagnoses known ONNX-side error patterns and
that handoffs to `quark-onnx-install` happen for runtime/provider issues.

**Manual procedure:**

1. Pick a known ONNX error scenario. Examples:
   - `RuntimeError: CUDAExecutionProvider not in available providers` after installing
     `onnxruntime` (CPU build) instead of `onnxruntime-gpu`.
   - Custom-op library load failure for `BFPQuantizeDequantize` or `MXQuantizeDequantize`
     (missing C++ build, ABI mismatch).
   - `model.onnx` >2 GB and the run fails with "external data not found" because
     `use_external_data_format` was not set or the sibling `.onnx_data` was not staged.
   - OOM during calibration on a vision model with `num_calib_data=1000` and `batch_size=4`.
   - AdaRound divergence with default learning rate.
   - NPU CNN run fails because activation scales are not power-of-two.
2. Present the error (full traceback) to `quark-onnx-debug`.
3. Verify the diagnosis:
   - Root cause is correctly identified
   - A concrete fix command or config change is provided
   - For runtime/provider issues, the skill explicitly hands off to `quark-onnx-install`
     instead of silently swapping execution providers
   - For OOM, the skill suggests the documented ladder: reduce `num_calib_data` → drop
     `batch_size` to 1 → move calibration to CPU (`OptimDevice="cpu"`)
   - For custom-op load failures, the skill names the expected library path / build step
     rather than recommending the user ignore the op

**Pass criteria:** the diagnosis names the actual root cause, suggests a fix that would actually
work, and respects the "never silently fall back to CPU" rule from `quark-onnx-ptq-workflow`.

## Rules

- **Run at least one case per category before any ONNX release** — even small wording changes
  in preset names or custom-op names can shift routing or break generated scripts.
- **A failing case means the skill is broken, not the procedure** — investigate the skill first.
  Only update the expected behavior if the skill change was intentional.
- **Report all results**, not just failures. A clean run is positive evidence and worth recording.
- **Document new cases inline in the report.** As the ONNX skill set grows (e.g. new deployment
  target, new preset, new AutoSearchPro preset), add cases that cover the new triggers.
- **Cross-backend isolation is part of the protocol.** Every routing case must include a guard
  that confirms ONNX requests stay on `quark-onnx-*` skills.

## Interaction Flow

1. **Select scope:** which categories to verify — all four, or a subset affected by a recent change?
2. **Pick or write cases:** start from the examples above; add ONNX prompt files under
   `examples/agent_skills/prompts/` as the catalog grows.
3. **Run each case manually** following the protocol above in a fresh Claude Code session.
4. **Record results** in `validation_report.md` using the template.
5. **Hand off failures** to `quark-onnx-skill-sync` if they look like upstream drift, to
   `quark-onnx-doc-drift-check` if they look like stale user-facing facts, or directly to the
   affected skill's owner if it's a content bug.

## Recovery

- If a case can't run because a prerequisite artifact is missing (e.g., no `model_analysis.json`
  for the planning case), report the missing producer skill and stop — do not fabricate the input.
- If the ONNX custom-op binaries are not built locally, the recovery case for the custom-op load
  failure may produce a real failure rather than a simulated one — note this distinction in the
  report so future runs don't confuse genuine environment gaps with skill bugs.
- If Claude Code itself is misbehaving (ONNX skill not discovered, stub not loading), that's an
  infrastructure issue separate from skill quality — record it distinctly in the report.
- If an ONNX prompt routes to a torch skill (or vice versa), this is a routing-category failure
  and must block the release — cross-backend mis-routing produces wrong artifacts silently.
