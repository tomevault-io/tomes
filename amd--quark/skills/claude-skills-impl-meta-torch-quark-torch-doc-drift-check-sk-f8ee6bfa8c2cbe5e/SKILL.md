# quark-torch-doc-drift-check

## Purpose

Provide a lightweight governance check focused on documentation accuracy. While `quark-torch-skill-sync` audits source code changes broadly, this skill focuses specifically on whether the skills' user-facing guidance (install commands, scheme lists, model names, CLI flags) still matches what Quark's own docs and source say. Think of this as a fact-checker for the skill system.

## Inputs

- Quark upstream docs and source code (read-only)
- Current skill SKILL.md files

## Outputs: validation_report.md

Lists where current skill guidance has drifted from upstream Quark docs and source.

Schema: [`validation_report.schema.json`](../../../shared/contracts/validation_report.schema.json)

# Documentation Drift Report

## What to Check

### 1. CLI Flags Still Exist
The skills reference specific `quantize_quark.py` flags. Verify they are still in the argparse definitions:

**Critical flags to verify:**
- `--quant_scheme` — and that all 21 scheme names listed in `quark-torch-quant-plan` are still valid
- `--quant_algo` — and that all algorithm names are still valid
- `--model_export` — and that `hf_format`, `onnx`, `gguf` are still the options
- `--kv_cache_dtype` — still accepts `fp8`
- `--multi_gpu` — still accepts `auto` and `balanced`
- `--file2file_quantization` — still exists for ultra-large models
- `--trust_remote_code` — still defaults to True

### 2. Model Templates Still Exist
Check that `quark/torch/quantization/config/template.py` still contains all model templates listed in `quark-torch-model-intake`:

```python
# Key check: model_type values in the template registry
# Expected: llama, mistral, qwen, qwen2, qwen3, deepseek, phi, phi3, etc.
```

### 3. Contract Fields Match Workflow Needs

Verify that the JSON schemas in `.claude/skills-impl/shared/contracts/` match what the workflow actually produces:

- `session_context.schema.json` — does the schema match the `session_context.json` structure skills emit?
- `quant_plan.schema.json` — does it include all fields from `quark-torch-quant-plan`'s decision table?
- `run_manifest.schema.json` — does it match `quark-torch-llm-ptq-workflow`'s manifest output?

### 4. Install Docs Match

Compare `quark-torch-install`'s PyTorch version matrix with:

- `tools/ci/install_torch.sh` PyTorch version matrix
- `docs/source/install.rst` installation instructions

Compare `quark-install`'s dependency tables with:

- `pyproject.toml` Python version constraint
- `requirements.txt` core dependency versions
- `docs/source/install.rst` installation instructions

### 5. Examples Don't Contradict

Check that the example prompts in `examples/agent_skills/prompts/` would still route correctly with current skill descriptions. Verify skill output formats against the schemas in `.claude/skills-impl/shared/contracts/` directly.

## Checking Process

```bash
# Extract current scheme list from source
grep -oP "register_scheme\(['\"](\w+)['\"]" quark/torch/quantization/config/template.py

# Extract CLI flags from quantize_quark.py
grep -oP "add_argument\(['\"]--(\w+)['\"]" examples/torch/language_modeling/llm_ptq/quantize_quark.py

# Extract model templates
grep -oP "model_type=['\"](\w+)['\"]" quark/torch/quantization/config/template.py

# Check Python version constraint
grep "requires-python" pyproject.toml
```

## Rules

- **This is a read-only check** — report findings but do not modify skills. Modifications go through `quark-torch-skill-sync`.
- **Focus on user-facing facts** — version numbers, command syntax, and option lists matter most because users will copy-paste them.
- **Flag removed items as critical** — a skill that recommends a deleted flag will cause immediate user failures.
- **Flag new items as informational** — a new scheme that is not yet documented in skills is a gap, not an error.

## Checks Performed

- CLI flags: 15 checked, 14 match, 1 drift
- Scheme list: 21 checked, 21 match
- Model templates: 36 checked, 34 match, 2 new (not in skills)
- Install versions: 8 checked, 7 match, 1 drift

## Findings

### CRITICAL: CLI flag renamed

- `--custom_mode` in skills → now `--export_mode` in source
- **Impact**: Copy-paste commands in quark-torch-export will fail
- **Action**: Update quark-torch-export SKILL.md

### INFO: New model templates not in skills

- `phi4` and `command_r` added to template.py
- **Impact**: Users asking about these models won't get model-specific guidance
- **Action**: Add to quark-torch-model-intake supported models table

### INFO: PyTorch 2.10.0 added for CUDA 13.0

- Skills already list 2.10.0 as supported — no action needed

## Interaction Flow

1. **Select scope**: Full check or focused on specific skills/facts?
2. **Run checks**: Compare skill content against upstream source and docs.
3. **Classify findings**: Critical (broken guidance), warning (outdated), info (gap in coverage).
4. **Report**: Produce the drift report.
5. **Hand off**: If fixes are needed, route to `quark-torch-skill-sync` for the actual updates.

## Recovery

- If upstream docs are inaccessible, report which checks could not be performed.
- If drift is detected, hand off to `quark-torch-skill-sync` with the specific findings so it can apply targeted fixes.
