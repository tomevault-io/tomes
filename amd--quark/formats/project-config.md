# Quant-Perf Claude Code Bootstrap

Read and follow `agent-instructions/PROJECT_RULES.md` for every task in this
module.

For PyTorch or HuggingFace model quantization, mixed-precision search, accuracy
evaluation, throughput benchmarking, TraceLens, GEAK, PerfOpt, session resume,
status, or reporting work, use the discovered `quark-torch-quant-perf` skill.
In a Quark source checkout, the module-local discovery entry is
`.claude/skills/quark-torch-quant-perf`. In a wheel installation or standalone
copy without the repository metadata and discovery directories, use a project-
or user-level installation of the same skill.

Treat `cli.py` as the source of truth for CLI options and defaults. Keep
detailed workflow instructions in the canonical skill rather than duplicating
them here.
