description: Apply a project's DESIGN.md (Google Stitch format + OmD v0.1 brand-philosophy layer) as authoritative brand context when generating or modifying UI. Use whenever the user asks for UI work — new components, styling changes, layout, microcopy, empty/error states, motion — and a DESIGN.md exists at the project root. Also use when the user asks to "apply the brand", "match the design", "follow the design system", or references OmD, DESIGN.md, or the brand explicitly. Use when this capability is needed.

# OmD — Brand Context for Claude Code

You are about to generate or modify UI for a project that ships a `DESIGN.md` at its root. This file is the brand's authoritative voice. Your job is to consume it correctly and refuse to default to AI-slop patterns.

## Step 1 — Detect

Check for these in order:

1. `./DESIGN.md` at the project root (primary).
2. `./.stitch/DESIGN.md` (Google Stitch's internal location — still valid OmD).
3. `./spec/omd-*.md` if the project ships a custom-versioned spec.

If none exist, stop. Tell the user: *"No DESIGN.md found. Run `npx omd init` to scaffold one, or proceed without brand context (output will be generic)."* Do not invent brand rules.

If a `DESIGN.md` exists, read the whole file before writing a single line of UI. Do not skim.

## Step 2 — Parse

Look at the frontmatter:

```yaml
---
omd: 0.1
brand: <name>
---
```

- **Frontmatter present with `omd:` key** → full OmD file. Sections 10–15 are authoritative.
- **No frontmatter** → Google Stitch base only. Treat sections 1–9 as authoritative; do not invent sections 10–15.

The 15 possible sections:

```
Base (Google Stitch, required)
  1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere      — the "feel" paragraph
  2. Color Palette & Roles          — named + hex, always paired
  3. Typography Rules               — family, scale, tracking, features
  4. Component Stylings             — button, card, input, nav specs
  5. Layout Principles              — spacing scale, grid, radius
  6. Depth & Elevation              — shadow system
  7. Do's and Don'ts                — explicit constraints
  8. Responsive Behavior            — breakpoints, touch targets
  9. Agent Prompt Guide             — quick-ref + example prompts

Brand Philosophy (OmD v0.1)
 10. Voice & Tone                   — microcopy constraints
 11. Brand Narrative                — the "why"
 12. Principles                     — first-principles rules
 13. Personas                       — who this is for
 14. States                         — empty/error/loading patterns
 15. Motion & Easing                — duration + easing tokens
```

## Step 3 — Apply (the contract)

When generating UI, the file's sections act as *constraints*, not suggestions.

### Hard rules

1. **Every color you use MUST appear in section 2.** If you need a color that isn't there, stop and ask. Do not invent hex values. Do not "borrow" a complementary color.
2. **Every font MUST appear in section 3.** Never substitute Inter/Roboto/Arial/system-ui as a fallback — if they aren't in the stack, they aren't allowed.
3. **Component shapes (radius, padding, shadow) MUST come from sections 4–6.** If a radius scale is declared, values outside it are forbidden.
4. **Microcopy MUST match section 10.** If "forbidden phrases" are listed, they are banned. If tone mappings are given, follow them. A button label that violates the voice is wrong even if the component shape is correct.
5. **Empty / error / loading / skeleton states MUST come from section 14.** Do not invent a "No data found 😔" card. Use the declared treatment.
6. **Motion MUST use section 15 tokens.** If durations are named (`motion-fast`, `motion-standard`), wire them to those names — do not hardcode `200ms`.
7. **Principles (section 12) are tiebreakers.** When two valid interpretations compete, the principles decide. They override your defaults.
8. **Do's and Don'ts (section 7) are non-negotiable.** A "Don't" is a hard block.

### Soft rules

- Section 1 (Visual Theme) sets the mood. Use it to resolve ambiguity — "how loud should this hero be?" is answered there, not by asking the user.
- Section 11 (Narrative) and section 13 (Personas) are context for *judgement calls*. When generating a specific concrete artifact (a balance card, a transaction row), ask: "Would 정민 at 8:47am on the subway recognize this?" If no, revise.

### What to never do

OmD files exist specifically to prevent these defaults. If you find yourself about to do any of the following, stop:

- **Inter / Roboto / Arial / Fraunces / system-ui** as a typography default — these are the named AI-slop fonts. If the file says Inter, fine; if not, never add it.
- **Purple on white** (`#A855F7`-ish on `#FFFFFF`) — the most overfitted AI palette.
- **Unjustified gradient backgrounds** — especially purple-to-pink or blue-to-purple hero gradients.
- **Left-accent cards** — the 4px colored vertical bar on the left of a card is a Bootstrap-era reflex. Banned unless the file declares it.
- **SVG line-drawing illustrations** ("two people shaking hands in single-weight line art") — AI-slop illustration style.
- **Unjustified emoji** — especially 🚀 ✨ 💡. Only use emoji if section 10 explicitly allows them, or if they are first-class brand elements (e.g., Tossface).
- **Generic empty states** — "No data found", "Nothing to see here", sad illustration. Use section 14 or ask.
- **`rounded-xl` / `shadow-md` / other framework shorthand without the underlying values.** The underlying values are in the file; use them.

## Step 4 — Write with citations

When you produce code that applies the spec, cite the section in an inline comment only when the choice is non-obvious. Example:

```tsx
// Voice (§10): "송금하기" per CTA imperative rule
<Button>송금하기</Button>

<Card
  // Radius 12 = Comfortable (§5), shadow from Level 2 (§6)
  className="rounded-[12px] shadow-[0px_2px_8px_rgba(0,0,0,0.08)]"
/>
```

Do NOT cite sections in production-intent code comments — only use them when the reader would otherwise be puzzled by the specific value. Well-named design tokens (`--color-blue-500`, `--motion-standard`) do not need citations; raw hex values and magic numbers do.

## Step 5 — Fail loud

If a required section (1–5) is missing, refuse to generate UI that depends on it. Tell the user exactly what is missing:

*"DESIGN.md is missing section 3 (Typography Rules). I can't pick a font for this heading without guessing. Add Typography Rules or tell me the font family, scale, and weight now."*

This is a feature, not a bug. Agents that silently fill in gaps produce branded-like-nobody UI.

## Notes on Google-Stitch-only files

If the file has no frontmatter and sections 10–15 are absent:

- Treat sections 7 (Do's and Don'ts) and 9 (Agent Prompt Guide) as partial voice/microcopy substitutes. They are weaker than a real section 10, so microcopy decisions may require asking the user.
- Do not invent a Voice section by inferring from Visual Theme. Ask instead.
- For empty/error/loading: ask the user directly. Do not default.

## Notes on cross-tool portability

OmD `DESIGN.md` files are designed to be consumed by Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI/Antigravity, Copilot, and Google Stitch. When you write code that references the spec, keep the reference *implicit in the code* (use declared tokens, match declared components). Do not hard-code a string like "per Claude Code's reading of DESIGN.md" — the file is source of truth for *any* agent.
