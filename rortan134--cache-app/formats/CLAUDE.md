## Development workflow

Cache has a zero technical debt policy. Do it right the first time: the design that lands in the codebase should be the correct one, with no intentional debt in that surface. A problem solved in design costs less than one solved in implementation, which costs less than one solved in production. "Right the first time" describes the landed output, not the exploration that produced it — see simplicity below. When rules conflict, prefer in order: correctness and safety of the change surface, then scope discipline (task-only files and isolation), then local coherence in files you already touch, then YAGNI, then style.

Leave the codebase better than you found it.

Suggest solutions or alternatives I didn’t think about and anticipate my needs.

When the request is wrong, unsafe, or would not work, block it and offer alternatives. When it is merely suboptimal, challenge once with a concrete alternative, then execute the user's choice unless a hard constraint still fails. Reframe from first principles when that reaches a better answer.

Learn from existing code: Study and plan before implementing. Identify recurring patterns and design influences in the code. Keep rules or constraints of the task in mind.

Trace how parts connect, such as data flow between functions, stage dependencies, or what module owns what.

If a tradeoff is required, choose correctness and robustness over short-term convenience or shortcuts.

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

It is not about formatting or syntax. Linters handle that. It is about how to think, how to make decisions, and what to value when building software.

Read the full implementation of what you change and its direct callers/callees, not just the signature and not the whole repo.

Simple and elegant systems are easier to design correctly, more efficient in execution, and more reliable. That simplicity requires hard work and discipline.

Simplicity is not the first attempt. It is the hardest revision. It takes thought, multiple passes, and the willingness to throw work away. The goal is to find the idea that solves multiple problems at once.

Follow the rationale that each function should have a single, named responsibility. Keep functions small enough to reason about in isolation such that it is understandable and verifiable as a logical unit (self-contained). If you need to trace external state to understand it, it's too large or too coupled, step back and consider whether it should be broken up.

Strive for writing fully functional, bug-free code by using best practices and minimizing room for error by, for example, making illegal states unrepresentable.

Avoid unnecessary code indirection. Extract when the same reason to change applies in two or more modules and the name is obvious; similar code with different futures may stay duplicated. Extracting a className string into a constant just because it is used twice is not justified.

Follow YAGNI. Prefer the smallest clear unit, not the fewest lines — one-liners only for pure expressions with no branching, I/O, or error paths.

Composition over inheritance. Prefer dependency injection.

Handle errors at the appropriate scopes. Never silently swallow exceptions. If you think an error cannot happen, assert that assumption explicitly.

Never compromise type safety: avoid `any`, `!` (non-null assertion), and `as Type` casting as they usually indicate wrong assumptions or bad implementation. A cast is allowed only at a trust boundary (SDK, ORM, framework) when the invariant is runtime-checked or guaranteed by a typed wrapper one layer in. Prefer narrowing (`zod`, predicates, exhaustiveness). If you need a cast deeper than the boundary, fix the model.

Declare variables at the smallest possible scope. Minimize the number of variables in play at any point. This reduces the probability of using the wrong variable and makes code easier to reason about. Calculate or check variables close to where they are used. Do not introduce variables before they are needed or leave them around when they are not.

Plugin architectures allow for extensibility and isolation; most functionality should live in plugins, not the core, enabling parallel development and future-proofing. Apply a plugin boundary when pluggability is itself a current requirement (sync adapters, export formats, AI providers). YAGNI governs speculative features — do not extract a plugin boundary for a single implementation.

Minimize risk by anticipating what’s most likely to fail (platforms, language changes, hardware, people...) and insulating your system from those points of failure.

Great names capture what a thing is or does. Append qualifiers to names. Units, bounds, and modifiers come at the end. This groups related variables together and makes scanning easier.

Before adding a new utility, check if a similar one exists in the `lib/common` directory or nearby module scope as utils.

Anchor design decisions on the user's primary task or focus, to make sure the user can complete those tasks easily, not overwhelmed by unrelated UI clutter or user flows. Our UI should help users complete their tasks, not hinder them.

Constants are module-level and UPPER_SNAKE_CASE: Physics constants, selectors, and thresholds are declared at the top of the file, never inside the component.

Inline single-use values when the expression is obvious in place. Keep a name when it encodes units, domain meaning, or a non-obvious intermediate — even if used once.

```ts
// Good
const journal = await Bun.file(path.join(dir, "journal.json")).json()

// Bad
const journalPath = path.join(dir, "journal.json")
const journal = await Bun.file(journalPath).json()
```

## React components

Build React components following full `vercel-composition-patterns` and `vercel-react-best-practices` rules.

Every component should be co-located into a single file with its parts, and should use a common, composable interface, making them predictable.

Use the `useTimeout` utility from `@base-ui/utils/useTimeout` instead of `window.setTimeout`, and `useAnimationFrame` from `@base-ui/utils/useAnimationFrame` instead of `requestAnimationFrame`.

Use the `useStableCallback` utility from `@base-ui/utils/useStableCallback` instead of `React.useCallback` whenever the function is passed into an effect, an event handler, or any other long-lived closure — `useStableCallback` guarantees a stable identity without re-running on every render, which the React Compiler does not do for free. The utility cannot be used to memoize functions that are called directly in the body of a component (during render); in those cases the React Compiler memoizes the value automatically, so no manual hook is needed.

Use the `useIsoLayoutEffect` utility from `@base-ui/utils/useIsoLayoutEffect` instead of `React.useLayoutEffect`.

Use the shadow DOM-safe utilities for DOM traversal and event targeting: `contains`, `getTarget`, and `activeElement`. Use the owner utilities `ownerDocument` and `ownerWindow` instead of global `document`/`window` lookups when the code is tied to a DOM node, including realm-sensitive checks such as `instanceof`.

Avoid duplicating logic where necessary: If two components can share logic (such as event handlers), define the logic/handlers in the parent and share it through a context to the child; use the existing context if it exists.

Never show the empty state during the loading state. Loading indicators (skeletons, spinners) and empty states are mutually exclusive — guard empty state checks with `isLoading` so the loading UI renders first, and the empty state only appears after loading completes with zero results.

### File-Level Definition Order

Make sure every component file follows the same vertical stack. Deviations are rare: a stateless pure helper may live above the component only when it is consumed by module-level stateless objects (step #4); helpers that close over component internals or any per-render value live below the types at the bottom (steps #8–#9).

1. Imports
2. Module-level constants (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE)
3. Module-level types/interfaces that are not component props or state (e.g., TouchScrollState)
4. Module-level stateless objects (e.g., stateAttributesMapping)
5. Module-level pure helper functions used by #4 (if any)
6. Component prop/state interfaces (export interface ComponentProps ...)
7. Component definition (export const Component = forwardRef(function Component(...)))
8. Private helper functions used only by the component
9. Private sub-components used only by the component

### Component Body: Internal Ordering

Inside the component function, hooks and logic should be grouped in a predictable sequence:

```ts
export const DrawerPopup = (
  componentProps: DrawerPopup.Props,
  forwardedRef: React.ForwardedRef<HTMLDivElement>,
) => {
  // 1. Destructure render/className/style first, then ...elementProps
  const { render, className, style, finalFocus, initialFocus, ...elementProps } = componentProps;

  // 2. Context reads
  const { store } = useDialogRootContext();
  const { swipeDirection, ... } = useDrawerRootContext();

  // 3. Store state reads (batched together)
  const descriptionElementId = store.useState('descriptionElementId');
  const modal = store.useState('modal');
  const open = store.useState('open');
  // ...

  // 4. Other hooks that don't depend on #5-#7
  useDialogPortalContext();

  // 5. Derived values
  const nestedDrawerOpen = nestedOpenDrawerCount > 0;

  // 6. Local useState
  const [popupHeight, setPopupHeight] = React.useState(0);

  // 7. Refs
  const popupHeightRef = React.useRef(0);

  // 8. Handlers (useStableCallback / useCallback)
  const measureHeight = useStableCallback(() => { ... });
  const handleOpenChange = useStableCallback((nextOpen) => { ... });

  // 9. Effects
  useIsoLayoutEffect(() => { ... }, [...]);
  React.useEffect(() => { ... }, [...]);

  // 10. Build the state object for useRenderElement
  const state: DrawerPopupState = { open, nested, ... };

  // 11. Compute final props / styles
  let popupHeightCssVarValue: string | undefined;
  if (popupHeight && !shouldUseAutoHeight) {
    popupHeightCssVarValue = `${popupHeight}px`;
  }

  // 12. Render
  const element = useRenderElement('div', componentProps, { ... });
  return <FloatingFocusManager ...>{element}</FloatingFocusManager>;
};
```

### Boolean Naming Conventions

Boolean variables follow a rigid prefix convention. Scanning the files:

| Prefix           | Example                                                | Context                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| is               | isVerticalScrollAxis, isNestedDrawerOpenRef            | State or derived condition   |
| has              | hasNestedDrawer, hasCrossAxisScrollableContent         | Possession                   |
| should           | shouldUseAutoHeight, shouldApplySnapPoints, shouldDamp | Conditional behavior         |
| can              | canSwipeFromScrollEdgeOnMove, canStart                 | Capability / permission      |
| allow            | allowSwipe, allowTouchMove                             | Permission in touch handling |
| disable / enable | disablePointerDismissal, enabled                       | Feature flags                |

### Ref Naming

Refs are initialized to their semantic empty state (false, 0, null, ''), never undefined unless the type requires it.

| Pattern               | Example                            | Meaning                                 |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| xRef                  | popupHeightRef, lastPointerTypeRef | Plain ref holding a value               |
| xRef.current = fn     | resetSwipeRef.current = resetSwipe | Callback ref pattern                    |
| isNestedDrawerOpenRef | isNestedDrawerOpenRef              | Boolean ref for stale-closure avoidance |

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

<!-- END:nextjs-agent-rules -->

## Server Actions / Service module pattern

We organize and co-locate Next.js Server Actions as thin adapters in `lib/{module}/actions.ts` files that handle input/output validation, auth/session and privilege checks, error normalization, caching/revalidation and rate limiting. These actions call pure service functions which contain all business logic and database/external-API calls. Services never depend on the framework; they operate on validated data and return domain objects/typed results, and can be used independently either for other modules, as side effects, or pure server components.

Actions are the only networking boundary: they parse/validate inputs, guard with user context, translate service results to serialized responses, and decide application-specific side effects, like `revalidatePath()`. Behind the scenes, actions use the `POST` method. On the client, an action is consumed in one of two ways: as a read, by wrapping it in a small fetcher function passed to [swr](https://swr.vercel.app/llms.txt) (SWR calls the function locally); or as a mutation, by calling it directly from an event handler or form action. Either way the action is imported and invoked as an ordinary async function — the type signature of the export is the type of the call site, so requests and responses are fully inferred without an intermediate schema. Actions should return the minimal stable contract the current consumer needs — prefer a small DTO over entire domain objects or field-by-field thrash.

## Logging and error handling pattern

Instrument critical paths. Log errors with context. Emit metrics for failure rates. Trace requests across service boundaries.

Logging lives at `lib/common/logs/console/logger.ts`:
  `createLogger(module)` returns a scoped logger with `.debug/.info/.warn/.error` and a `.time()` helper for spans.

Named error module lives at `lib/common/error.ts`:
  `NamedError.create("SomeDomainError", z.object({...}))` creates a typed error class with runtime-validated `data` and a stable `name`.

Use these in services and actions to propagate domain failures with structured metadata (e.g., `{ operation, message, ... }`).

## Data model

The data model can be found at `prisma/schema.prisma`
