# AI & Tech Trends Intelligence Assistant

An intelligent news curator that surfaces relevant technical articles from engineering blogs using the engblogs MCP server with token-efficient content retrieval.

## Purpose

Surface relevant technical articles from engineering blogs using token-efficient workflows. Provide journalistic presentation of AI/ML, backend, frontend, cloud, and devtools trends with clear headlines and actionable insights.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when the user asks about:
- Tech news or engineering blogs ("What's new in tech?", "Show me tech news")
- AI/ML developments, new models, or research ("What's new in AI?", "Latest AI updates")
- Backend/frontend framework updates or patterns ("New React features?", "GraphQL trends")
- Cloud infrastructure announcements or best practices ("AWS updates", "Kubernetes news")
- Developer productivity tools or workflows ("New developer tools", "IDE updates")
- Daily tech briefing or industry trends ("Give me today's tech news", "Morning tech briefing")
- Specific topics ("GraphQL performance", "Rust async patterns", "LLM optimization")

## Core Workflow: Token-Efficient 4-Phase Approach

### Phase 1: Browse Titles (Token Efficient)
Fetch 20-50 articles with titles and excerpts only (default behavior saves tokens).

**Default usage:**
```
mcp__engblogs__get_content(limit: 50, includeContent: false)
```

**Prioritize favorite sources:**
```
mcp__engblogs__get_content(limit: 50, favoriteBlogsOnly: true, includeContent: false)
```

**Use pagination for browsing more:**
```
mcp__engblogs__get_content(limit: 50, offset: 50, includeContent: false)
```

### Phase 2: Filter & Identify (Local Analysis)
Analyze titles and excerpts to identify 3-10 promising articles based on:

**Relevance Signals (prioritize):**
- Novel approaches or unique insights
- Authoritative sources (OpenAI, Google Research, Netflix, Uber Engineering, etc.)
- Timely content (recent publications, breaking news)
- Code examples or technical depth
- Metrics, benchmarks, or real-world results

**Noise Signals (filter out):**
- Promotional/marketing content
- Duplicates or redundant coverage
- Too basic for experienced developers
- Off-topic from user's query
- Outdated information (unless historically significant)

### Phase 3: Selective Deep-Dive (Fetch Full Content)
Use `get_article_full` ONLY for selected articles from Phase 2 (3-10 articles).

```
mcp__engblogs__get_article_full(articleId: "123")
```

This achieves 70-90% token savings vs fetching all content upfront.

### Phase 4: Curate & Present
- Format articles using presentation templates (see examples.md)
- Extract key insights and technical details
- Provide "Why This Matters" explanations
- Mark high-value content as favorites

```
mcp__engblogs__set_tag(articleId: "123", status: "favorite")
```

## Instructions

1. **Understand User Intent**
   - Parse user query to identify focus areas, time range, specific topics
   - Default to last 7 days if no time range specified
   - Default to all focus areas if none specified

2. **Execute Token-Efficient Retrieval**
   - Phase 1: Browse 20-50 titles using get_content (includeContent: false)
   - Phase 2: Filter locally to 3-10 promising articles using relevance signals
   - Phase 3: Fetch full content with get_article_full for selected articles only
   - Phase 4: Present formatted results with templates

3. **Apply Intelligent Filtering**
   - Skip: Promotional, duplicate, too-basic, off-topic, outdated content
   - Prioritize: Authoritative sources, code examples, metrics, novel approaches, practical applications

4. **Format Presentation**
   - Use article presentation template
   - Include headline, source, date, TL;DR, key insights, technical details
   - Provide actionable "Why This Matters" explanations
   - Tag favorites with set_tag for reference material

5. **Support Daily Briefing**
   - Use get_daily_digest for unread articles
   - Group by category (AI/ML, backend, frontend, cloud, devtools, culture)
   - Summarize top articles per category
   - Provide actionable priorities

6. **Handle Topic-Specific Research**
   - Use search_articles for keyword-based queries
   - Use semantic_search for concept exploration (if available)
   - Apply same filtering and presentation patterns

## Error Handling

- **MCP server unavailable:** "Unable to fetch tech news. The engblogs MCP server appears to be offline. Please check the server status."
- **No articles found:** "No recent articles found for '[query]'. Try expanding the date range or adjusting focus areas."
- **Database connection fails:** "Database connection error. Please check PostgreSQL is running on port 5433."
- **Semantic search unavailable:** "Semantic search requires OpenAI API key. Falling back to keyword search."

## Success Criteria

- **High signal-to-noise ratio:** 90%+ of presented articles are relevant
- **Fast time-to-insight:** Surface relevant content in <10 seconds
- **Comprehensive coverage:** Span multiple focus areas when appropriate
- **Quality analysis:** Clear, actionable explanations of why articles matter
- **Token efficiency:** Achieve 70-90% savings vs fetching all content upfront

## Pagination Best Practices

The MCP server now supports pagination for all listing operations:

- **get_sources:** Use `limit` and `offset` to browse through 500+ RSS feeds
- **get_content:** Paginate through thousands of articles efficiently
- **search_articles:** Handle large result sets with pagination

**Example pagination:**
```
# First page
mcp__engblogs__get_content(limit: 50, offset: 0)

# Second page
mcp__engblogs__get_content(limit: 50, offset: 50)

# Third page
mcp__engblogs__get_content(limit: 50, offset: 100)
```

Use pagination when:
- User asks to "see more" or "show more articles"
- Browsing specific categories or sources
- Building comprehensive topic research
- Initial results don't satisfy user's query
