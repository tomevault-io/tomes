# Scan Inbox

Analyzes your Apple Mail inbox to identify unread, actionable, and priority messages within a specified time range.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when the user asks questions like:
- "Check my email"
- "What unread emails do I have?"
- "Any urgent emails?"
- "Show me actionable items from my inbox"
- "Triage my email from today"

## What This Skill Does

1. Scans all inbox accounts in Apple Mail
2. Filters messages by time range (default: last 24 hours)
3. Identifies unread messages
4. Detects actionable keywords (deadline, urgent, action required, meeting, request, etc.)
5. Identifies priority/flagged messages
6. Returns structured data with counts and message details

## Instructions

### Step 1: Determine Time Range
Ask the user if they want a specific time range, or use these defaults:
- "Today" or "recent" → 24 hours
- "This week" or "recent days" → 48-72 hours
- Specific request → Honor their time range

### Step 2: Execute the Scan
Run the AppleScript skill using the Bash tool:

\`\`\`bash
osascript .claude/skills/scan-inbox/scripts/scan_inbox.scpt <hours> false
\`\`\`

Parameters:
- `<hours>`: Number of hours to look back (e.g., 24, 48, 72)
- `false`: Set to `true` for priority-only mode

### Step 3: Parse Results
The script returns:
- `success`: boolean (true/false)
- `unreadCount`: Total unread messages
- `actionableCount`: Messages with actionable keywords
- `priorityCount`: Flagged/priority messages
- `unreadList`: Array of unread message details (sender, subject, date, flagged status)
- `actionableList`: Array of actionable messages
- `priorityList`: Array of priority messages

### Step 4: Present Results to User
Format the output in a clear, actionable way:

**Example Response:**
\`\`\`
📬 Inbox Summary (Last 24 Hours)

📊 Overview:
- 38 unread messages
- 0 actionable items
- 0 priority/flagged

📧 Recent Unread:
1. Google - Security alert
2. C# Digest - Newsletter
3. BAC Credomatic - Transaction notification
... (showing top 5-10)

💡 Next Steps:
- No urgent items requiring immediate attention
- Review newsletters when you have time
\`\`\`

### Step 5: Offer Follow-up Actions
Ask if the user wants to:
- See more details about specific emails
- Flag or organize certain messages
- Extract tasks from actionable emails
- Check a different time range

## Actionable Keywords Detected

The skill identifies these keywords in email subjects:
- deadline
- urgent
- action required
- meeting
- request
- please review
- asap
- todo
- action item

## Error Handling

If the script fails:
1. Check Mail automation permissions: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation → Terminal/Claude
2. Verify Apple Mail is running
3. Try with a smaller time range if timeout occurs

## Example Usage

**User**: "Check my email from today"

**Claude Response**:
\`\`\`bash
osascript .claude/skills/scan-inbox/scripts/scan_inbox.scpt 24 false
\`\`\`

Then format and present the results to the user.

## Privacy Note

This skill only reads mail metadata (sender, subject, date, flags). It does not access email body content to protect privacy.
