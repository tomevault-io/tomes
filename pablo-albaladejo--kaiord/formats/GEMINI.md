## Quality Standards

**CRITICAL: Zero Tolerance for Warnings and Errors**

When working on this codebase, ALL problems must be fixed, regardless of whether they were introduced in the current branch or pre-existing:

- ✅ **Zero ESLint warnings** - All linting rules must pass
- ✅ **Zero TypeScript errors** - Strict type checking with no `any` escapes
- ✅ **Zero test warnings** - Clean test output (React act(), accessibility, etc.)
- ✅ **Zero build warnings** - Vite, ESBuild, etc. must produce clean output
- ✅ **Zero IDE warnings** - SonarQube, accessibility, and static analysis warnings must be resolved (treat as lint errors)
- ✅ **Coverage thresholds met** - 80% for core packages, 70% for frontend
- ✅ **All tests passing** - 100% pass rate across all packages
- ✅ **Mechanical guards passing** - `pnpm test:scripts` enforces:
  - `check-no-zustand-writethrough.mjs` — no Zustand store writes Dexie directly (R-DexieImport / R-PersistStateImport / R-AppDexieImport)
  - `check-no-pii-leakage.mjs` — toast and `console.*` first arguments under `packages/workout-spa-editor/src/{components,hooks,lib}/**` are static (bare string literal or top-level SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE constant referencing a literal); rule R-PIIInterpolation
  - `check-no-library-dual-mount.mjs` — no-dual-mount invariant for the Library content component (spec/spa-routing); only `LibraryPage.tsx` and `TemplatePickerDialog.tsx` may import `organisms/WorkoutLibrary` / `WorkoutLibrary/WorkoutLibrary` / `LibraryDialogContent` (R-LibraryNoDualMount)
  - `check-session-match-id-shape.mjs` — every `coachingActivityId:` literal in a `sessionMatches` write call site, plus every `[profileId+coachingActivityId]` Dexie reader, MUST be constructed via `buildCoachingActivityId(...)`, `toPersistedCoachingActivityId(...)`, or a `CoachingActivityRecord.id` property access; rule R-SessionMatchIdShape (see `.omc/autopilot/bug-trace.md` §H7 for the original SHORT/COMPOSITE divergence)
  - `check-no-barrel-test-suites.mjs` — no `*.test.{ts,tsx}` may target a subject module that is a pure re-export barrel; test the source modules instead (R-NoBarrelTestSuite, spec/test-minimality)
  - `check-discovery-clock-reset.mjs` — any `*.test.{ts,tsx}` whose static imports reach `hooks/connections/use-discovery-settled` MUST call `resetDiscoveryClock` (or `vi.mock` that hook); rule R-DiscoveryClockReset (spec/test-conventions). The gate measures `Date.now()` against a MODULE-LOAD origin, so a case passes on how long its own file took to reach it. Scope is WITHIN a file: `isolate: true` is in force (no `isolate`/`pool` in `vitest.config.ts`), so module state does not leak between files — the risk is elapsed time and case order inside one file, not cross-file bleed. Rooted at the reader, not at `discovery-clock.ts`: `use-bridge-discovery-bootstrap` only WRITES the clock, and rooting at the clock flags four route-level suites that never measure it
  - `check-frozen-hex-parity.mjs` — a `<canvas>` has no cascade and the chart helpers run before the stylesheet exists under jsdom, so a few modules freeze a hex mirror of the role they stand for. Each frozen constant is pinned to its role's resolved value, because a hand transcription goes stale silently when the ramp moves (R-FrozenHexParity)
  - `check-no-raw-chromatic.mjs` — no raw chromatic Tailwind utility (`bg-red-600`, `text-amber-400`, …) under `packages/workout-spa-editor/src`. The palette is achromatic neutrals + five zone hues + one danger ramp, and a component may only name a role; a raw utility is neither role nor ramp, and the rebrand's own greps could not see it because they look for literal hex and `--brand-*` names. Neutral families and comments are exempt (R-NoRawChromatic)
  - `check-boundaries-allowlist.mjs` — the `boundaries/dependencies` allowlist in `scripts/boundaries-allowlist.mjs` is shrink-only: it may never grow past `BOUNDARIES_ALLOWLIST_MAX`, every entry needs a reason, and an entry whose file no longer imports `adapters/` is stale and must be deleted (R-BoundariesAllowlistShrinkOnly). Never park a _new_ violation here — fix the import instead

If you encounter warnings or errors during your work:

1. **Fix them immediately** - Don't defer or document for later
2. **Fix pre-existing issues** - Clean up technical debt proactively
3. **Leave the codebase cleaner** - Boy Scout Rule applies

This policy ensures professional code quality and prevents warning/error accumulation.

## Architecture (Hexagonal + Plugin)

```
packages/
├── core/src/
│   ├── domain/           # Pure types & Zod schemas (no dependencies)
│   ├── application/      # Use cases, provider types (depends only on ports)
│   ├── ports/            # I/O contracts (interfaces)
│   └── adapters/logger/  # Console logger only
├── fit/src/adapters/     # FIT reader/writer implementations
├── tcx/src/adapters/     # TCX reader/writer/validator implementations
├── zwo/src/adapters/     # ZWO reader/writer/validator implementations
├── all/src/              # Meta-package wiring all adapters
├── cli/src/              # CLI commands
└── mcp/src/              # MCP server for AI/LLM integration
```

**Critical rules:**

- `domain` depends on nothing
- `application` MUST NOT import external libs or adapters
- Adapter packages (`fit`, `tcx`, `zwo`) depend on `core` only
- Strategy pattern: readers/writers injected into generic core functions
- KRD is the canonical format; all conversions go through KRD

## Public API

```typescript
// Core: format-agnostic conversion with strategy injection
fromBinary(buffer: Uint8Array, reader: BinaryReader, logger?: Logger): Promise<KRD>
fromText(text: string, reader: TextReader, logger?: Logger): Promise<KRD>
toBinary(krd: KRD, writer: BinaryWriter, logger?: Logger): Promise<Uint8Array>
toText(krd: KRD, writer: TextWriter, logger?: Logger): Promise<string>

// Adapters: dual exports (pre-built + factory)
import { fitReader } from '@kaiord/fit';        // pre-built
import { createFitReader } from '@kaiord/fit';   // factory(logger?)
```

## Language

**All code, comments, documentation, commit messages, and AI-generated content MUST be in English**, regardless of the language the user communicates in. This includes:

- Code comments and documentation
- Commit messages and PR descriptions
- Changeset descriptions
- Error messages and logs
- AI agent responses and plans

## Code Style

- **TypeScript strict mode** - No implicit `any`
  - **Documented exception — bridge extensions**: the `packages/*-bridge`
    packages (`garmin-bridge`, `train2go-bridge`, `whoop-bridge`,
    `trainingpeaks-bridge`, `tanita-bridge`) are plain
    JavaScript. Chrome extensions ship as flat, unbundled files that the
    packager copies verbatim, with shared code vendored by byte-copy (see
    `openspec/specs/bridge-core/spec.md` for the packaging/vendoring
    contract; `openspec/specs/adapter-contracts/spec.md` covers the
    background/content/messaging security pattern). The strict-TS policy
    does not apply there; their correctness is covered by their vitest
    suites.
- **Max 100 lines per file** (tests exempt)
  - Do NOT write JSDoc preambles that justify file extractions, reference
    PRs/issues, or narrate prior code states. The 100-line cap is enforced by
    ESLint; the split itself does not need explanation. Choose a descriptive
    file name instead. Comments are reserved for non-obvious algorithm or
    invariant explanation.
- **Max 40 lines per function** (60 for React components)
- **Use `type` not `interface`**
- **Separate type imports**: `import type { X } from "..."`
- **Functions over classes** - Factory functions (`createValidator()`) preferred

**Schema conventions:**

- Domain schemas use **snake_case**: `indoor_cycling`, `lap_swimming`
- Adapter schemas use **camelCase**: `indoorCycling`, `lapSwimming`
- Access enum values via `.enum`: `subSportSchema.enum.indoor_cycling`

**File naming:**

- Files: `kebab-case.ts`
- Mappers: `*.mapper.ts` (simple transformation, no logic, no tests)
- Converters: `*.converter.ts` (complex logic, requires tests)

## State Management

- **Zustand**: ONLY for `workout-store` (editor runtime: undo/redo, selection, clipboard). Never auto-persisted.
- **Dexie.js + `useLiveQuery`**: All persisted data (workouts, templates, profiles, AI providers, sync state). One query per page.
- **React state**: Ephemeral UI (useState for modals/spinners, useContext for shared runtime like bridge status).

Rule: "Editor runtime -> Zustand. Persisted data -> Dexie. Local UI -> React state."

## Testing

- **Round-trip tolerances**: time ±1s, power ±1W or ±1%FTP, HR ±1bpm, cadence ±1rpm
- **Coverage**: 80% for core, 70% for frontend
- Test utilities: `@kaiord/core/test-utils` exports fixture loaders

**Test types:**

- Unit tests for pure functions
- Integration tests for conversion pipelines
- Round-trip tests (FIT ↔ KRD ↔ TCX)
- CLI smoke: `kaiord convert --in sample.krd --out out.tcx`

### Test conventions (mechanically enforced — see `openspec/specs/test-conventions/spec.md`)

Two structural invariants on every `*.test.{ts,tsx}` file under `packages/**`:

1. **Title rule** (`R-ItTitleShould`) — every `it()`/`it.skip()`/`it.only()`/`it.each([...])(...)` title MUST start with the literal seven characters `s`, `h`, `o`, `u`, `l`, `d`, space (case-sensitive lowercase). Aliases via AST shape (any `it[.<alias>]`); vitest substitution placeholders stripped before the prefix check.
2. **AAA rule** (`R-ItBodyAAA`) — every `it()` body MUST contain canonical Pascal-case line comments `// Arrange`, `// Act`, `// Assert` (in that order, separated by blank lines). Multiple statements per section; empty sections allowed (the marker is required, the body can be empty).

```ts
it("should reject malformed input", () => {
  // Arrange
  const input = "bad";

  // Act
  const result = parse(input);

  // Assert
  expect(result.error).toBe("malformed");
});
```

Out-of-scope: `*.stories.{ts,tsx}`, `test-utils/`, `test-setup.ts`, `e2e/`.

Enforced at IDE (ESLint `vitest/valid-title` at `'error'`), pre-commit (`scripts/check-test-{title-should,aaa}.mjs --changed-files`), and CI (full-tree mode).

## Contribution Flow

1. **Spec phase** (for features and non-trivial fixes):
   - `/opsx:explore` — investigate the area, understand constraints
   - `/opsx:propose` — create proposal, specs, design, tasks in `openspec/changes/<slug>/`
   - Review and iterate on the spec before writing any code
2. Create feature branch: `feature/my-feature`, `fix/my-fix`
3. Implement following spec tasks and hexagonal architecture (`/opsx:apply`)
4. Add tests (follow AAA pattern, verify against spec scenarios)
5. Verify spec compliance: `/opsx:verify`
6. Run: `pnpm -r test && pnpm -r build && pnpm lint:fix`
7. Add changeset: `pnpm exec changeset` (for features/fixes)
8. Commit: `feat(scope): description` (conventional commits)
9. After PR merge: `/opsx:archive` — move change to archive

## OpenSpec Commands

| Command         | Purpose                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `/opsx:explore` | Investigate a feature area before proposing  |
| `/opsx:propose` | Create proposal + specs + design + tasks     |
| `/opsx:apply`   | Implement guided by active spec              |
| `/opsx:verify`  | Verify implementation against spec scenarios |
| `/opsx:archive` | Archive completed change after merge         |
| `/opsx:sync`    | Update domain specs after refactors          |

## Adding a New Package

When adding a new publishable package to the monorepo, update these CI/CD files:

1. **`.changeset/config.json`** - Add to `linked` array
2. **`.github/workflows/changeset-bot.yml`** - Add to `PUBLISHABLE` list
3. **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** - Add to `paths` trigger, version tracking, and build step
4. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - Add to `test` matrix, `build` verification, and `detect-changes`
5. **`scripts/create-github-releases.js`** - Add package entry for GitHub releases

## Key References

- `AGENTS.md` - Strict AI guidance (non-negotiables)
- `openspec/config.yaml` - Project constraints for AI planning
- `openspec/specs/` - Domain specs (architecture, KRD format, adapter contracts)
- `openspec/SPEC_TEMPLATE.md` - Canonical shape for new domain specs
- `openspec/changes/` - Active feature specs and proposals
- `openspec/changes/archive/README.md` - Auto-generated index of archived changes. Do NOT hand-edit; run `pnpm archive:index` to refresh. CI verifies it is in sync via `pnpm lint:archive-index`.
- `scripts/check-spec-format.mjs` - Spec-format lint; run via `pnpm lint:specs`
- `docs/` - Architecture docs, code style, testing strategies
- `docs/krd-format.md` - KRD format specification

## Authoring a new capability spec

1. Copy `openspec/SPEC_TEMPLATE.md` to `openspec/specs/<capability-slug>/spec.md`.
2. Replace every `<...>` placeholder; leaving one will fail `pnpm lint:specs`.
3. Run `pnpm lint:specs` before committing. It runs the structural lint
   (tests + static checks) and `npx openspec validate --specs`. CI enforces
   the same check via `pnpm lint`.

## Archive conventions

Archived OpenSpec changes live under `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/`.
The date prefix is assigned once when the change is archived and MUST equal the
`> Completed:` marker at the top of its `proposal.md`. This invariant is enforced
by `scripts/check-archive-dates.mjs` via `pnpm lint:archive` (runs in CI as part
of `pnpm lint`).

The auto-generated `openspec/changes/archive/README.md` index MUST stay in sync
with its source folders — run `pnpm archive:index` after adding or renaming an
archive. CI verifies freshness via `pnpm lint:archive-index`
(`scripts/check-archive-index.mjs`), which prints the first differing lines on
failure so the fix is obvious from the log.

## Repo scripts

`scripts/` holds repo-wide tooling (archive invariants, extension packaging,
setup helpers). See `scripts/README.md` for the full inventory. Every
non-trivial script there MUST have a co-located `*.test.mjs` using `node:test`;
CI runs `pnpm test:scripts` in the lint job, and the husky `pre-commit` hook
runs the same suite locally.
