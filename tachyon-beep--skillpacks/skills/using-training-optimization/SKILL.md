# Using Training Optimization

## Overview

This meta-skill routes you to the right training optimization specialist based on symptoms. Training issues often have multiple potential causes—this skill helps diagnose symptoms and route to the appropriate specialist. Load this skill when you encounter training problems but aren't sure which specific technique to apply.

**Core Principle**: Diagnose before routing. Training issues often have multiple causes. Ask clarifying questions to understand symptoms before routing to specific skills. Wrong diagnosis wastes time—systematic routing saves it.

## When to Use

Load this skill when:
- Model not learning (loss stuck, not decreasing, poor accuracy)
- Training instability (loss spikes, NaN values, divergence)
- Overfitting (large train/val gap, poor generalization)
- Training too slow (throughput issues, time constraints)
- Hyperparameter selection (optimizer, learning rate, batch size, regularization)
- Experiment management (tracking runs, comparing configurations)
- Convergence issues (slow learning, plateaus, local minima)
- Setting up new training pipeline

**Don't use for**: PyTorch implementation bugs (use pytorch-engineering), model architecture selection (use neural-architectures), production deployment (use ml-production), RL-specific training (use deep-rl), LLM fine-tuning specifics (use llm-specialist)

## How to Access Reference Sheets

**IMPORTANT**: All reference sheets are located in the SAME DIRECTORY as this SKILL.md file.

When this skill is loaded from:
  `skills/using-training-optimization/SKILL.md`

Reference sheets like `optimization-algorithms.md` are at:
  `skills/using-training-optimization/optimization-algorithms.md`

NOT at:
  `skills/optimization-algorithms.md` ← WRONG PATH

When you see a link like `[optimization-algorithms.md](optimization-algorithms.md)`, read the file from the same directory as this SKILL.md.

## Routing by Primary Symptom

### Symptom: "Model Not Learning" / "Loss Not Decreasing"

**Keywords**: stuck, flat loss, not improving, not learning, accuracy not increasing

**Diagnostic questions (ask BEFORE routing):**
1. "Is loss completely flat from the start, decreasing very slowly, or was it learning then stopped?"
2. "Any NaN or Inf values in your loss?"
3. "What optimizer and learning rate are you using?"
4. "What does your loss curve look like over time?"

**Route based on answers:**

| Loss Behavior | Likely Cause | Route To | Why |
|---------------|--------------|----------|-----|
| Flat from epoch 0 | LR too low OR wrong optimizer OR inappropriate loss | **learning-rate-scheduling** + **optimization-algorithms** | Need to diagnose starting conditions |
| Was learning, then plateaued | Local minima OR LR too high OR overfitting | **learning-rate-scheduling** (scheduler) + check validation loss for overfitting | Adaptation needed during training |
| Oscillating wildly | LR too high OR gradient instability | **learning-rate-scheduling** + **gradient-management** | Instability issues |
| NaN or Inf | Gradient explosion OR numerical instability | **gradient-management** (PRIMARY) + **loss-functions-and-objectives** | Stability critical |
| Loss function doesn't match task | Wrong objective | **loss-functions-and-objectives** | Fundamental mismatch |

**Multi-skill routing**: Often need **optimization-algorithms** (choose optimizer) + **learning-rate-scheduling** (choose LR/schedule) together for "not learning" issues.

---

### Symptom: "Training Unstable" / "Loss Spikes" / "NaN Values"

**Keywords**: NaN, Inf, exploding, diverging, unstable, spikes

**Diagnostic questions:**
1. "When do NaN values appear - immediately at start, or after N epochs?"
2. "What's your learning rate and schedule?"
3. "Are you using mixed precision training?"
4. "What loss function are you using?"

**Route to (in priority order):**

1. **gradient-management** (PRIMARY)
   - When: Gradient explosion, NaN gradients
   - Why: Gradient issues cause instability. Must stabilize gradients first.
   - Techniques: Gradient clipping, gradient scaling, NaN debugging

2. **learning-rate-scheduling** (SECONDARY)
   - When: LR too high causes instability
   - Why: High LR can cause divergence even with clipped gradients
   - Check: If NaN appears later in training, LR schedule might be increasing too much

3. **loss-functions-and-objectives** (if numerical issues)
   - When: Loss computation has numerical instability (log(0), division by zero)
   - Why: Numerical instability in loss propagates to gradients
   - Check: Custom loss functions especially prone to this

**Cross-pack note**: If using mixed precision (AMP), also check pytorch-engineering (mixed-precision-and-optimization) for gradient scaling issues.

---

### Symptom: "Model Overfits" / "Train/Val Gap Large"

**Keywords**: overfitting, train/val gap, poor generalization, memorizing training data

**Diagnostic questions:**
1. "How large is your dataset (number of training examples)?"
2. "What's the train accuracy vs validation accuracy?"
3. "What regularization are you currently using?"
4. "What's your model size (parameters) relative to dataset size?"

**Route to (multi-skill approach):**

1. **overfitting-prevention** (PRIMARY)
   - Techniques: Dropout, weight decay, early stopping, L1/L2 regularization
   - When: Always the first stop for overfitting
   - Why: Comprehensive regularization strategy

2. **data-augmentation-strategies** (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)
   - When: Dataset is small (< 10K examples) or moderate (10K-100K)
   - Why: Increases effective dataset size, teaches invariances
   - Priority: Higher priority for smaller datasets

3. **hyperparameter-tuning**
   - When: Need to find optimal regularization strength
   - Why: Balance between underfitting and overfitting
   - Use: After implementing regularization techniques

**Decision factors:**
- Small dataset (< 1K): data-augmentation is CRITICAL + overfitting-prevention
- Medium dataset (1K-10K): overfitting-prevention + data-augmentation
- Large dataset (> 10K) but still overfitting: overfitting-prevention + check model capacity
- Model too large: Consider neural-architectures for model size discussion

---

### Symptom: "Training Too Slow" / "Low Throughput"

**Keywords**: slow training, low GPU utilization, takes too long, time per epoch

**CRITICAL: Diagnose bottleneck before routing**

**Diagnostic questions:**
1. "Is it slow per-step (low throughput) or just need many steps?"
2. "What's your GPU utilization percentage?"
3. "Are you using data augmentation? How heavy?"
4. "What's your current batch size?"

**Route based on bottleneck:**

| GPU Utilization | Likely Cause | Route To | Why |
|-----------------|--------------|----------|-----|
| < 50% consistently | Data loading bottleneck OR CPU preprocessing | **pytorch-engineering** (data loading, profiling) | Not compute-bound, infrastructure issue |
| High (> 80%) but still slow | Batch size too small OR need distributed training | **batch-size-and-memory-tradeoffs** + possibly pytorch-engineering (distributed) | Compute-bound, need scaling |
| High + heavy augmentation | Augmentation overhead | **data-augmentation-strategies** (optimization) + pytorch-engineering (profiling) | Augmentation CPU cost |
| Memory-limited batch size | Can't increase batch size due to OOM | **batch-size-and-memory-tradeoffs** (gradient accumulation) + pytorch-engineering (memory) | Memory constraints limiting throughput |

**Cross-pack boundaries:**
- Data loading issues → **pytorch-engineering** (DataLoader, prefetching, num_workers)
- Distributed training setup → **pytorch-engineering** (distributed-training-strategies)
- Batch size optimization for speed/memory → **training-optimization** (batch-size-and-memory-tradeoffs)
- Profiling to identify bottleneck → **pytorch-engineering** (performance-profiling)

**Key principle**: Profile FIRST before optimizing. Low GPU utilization = wrong optimization target.

### Symptom: "Which X Should I Use?" (Direct Questions)

**Direct hyperparameter questions route to specific skills:**

| Question | Route To | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| "Which optimizer?" | **optimization-algorithms** | SGD vs Adam vs AdamW, momentum, betas |
| "Which learning rate?" | **learning-rate-scheduling** | Initial LR, warmup, schedule type |
| "Which batch size?" | **batch-size-and-memory-tradeoffs** | Batch size effects on convergence and speed |
| "Which loss function?" | **loss-functions-and-objectives** | Cross-entropy vs focal vs custom |
| "How to prevent overfitting?" | **overfitting-prevention** | Dropout, weight decay, early stopping |
| "Which augmentation?" | **data-augmentation-strategies** | Type and strength of augmentation |
| "How to tune hyperparameters?" | **hyperparameter-tuning** | Search strategies, AutoML |
| "How to track experiments?" | **experiment-tracking** | MLflow, W&B, TensorBoard |

**For new project setup, route to MULTIPLE in sequence:**
1. **optimization-algorithms** - Choose optimizer
2. **learning-rate-scheduling** - Choose initial LR and schedule
3. **batch-size-and-memory-tradeoffs** - Choose batch size
4. **experiment-tracking** - Set up tracking
5. **training-loop-architecture** - Design training loop

---

### Symptom: "Need to Track Experiments" / "Compare Configurations"

**Keywords**: experiment tracking, MLflow, wandb, tensorboard, compare runs, log metrics

**Route to:**

1. **experiment-tracking** (PRIMARY)
   - Tools: MLflow, Weights & Biases, TensorBoard, Neptune
   - When: Setting up tracking, comparing runs, organizing experiments
   - Why: Systematic experiment management

2. **hyperparameter-tuning** (if systematic search)
   - When: Running many configurations systematically
   - Why: Automated hyperparameter search integrates with tracking
   - Combined: Hyperparameter search + experiment tracking workflow

3. **training-loop-architecture** (for integration)
   - When: Need to integrate tracking into training loop
   - Why: Proper callback and logging design
   - Combined: Training loop + tracking integration

---

## Cross-Cutting Multi-Skill Scenarios

### Scenario: New Training Setup (First Time)

**Route to (in order):**
1. **optimization-algorithms** - Select optimizer for your task
2. **learning-rate-scheduling** - Choose LR and warmup strategy
3. **batch-size-and-memory-tradeoffs** - Determine batch size
4. **loss-functions-and-objectives** - Verify loss function appropriate for task
5. **experiment-tracking** - Set up experiment logging
6. **training-loop-architecture** - Design training loop with checkpointing

**Why this order**: Foundation (optimizer/LR/batch) → Objective (loss) → Infrastructure (tracking/loop)

---

### Scenario: Convergence Issues

**Route to (diagnose first, then in order):**
1. **gradient-management** - Check gradients not vanishing/exploding (use gradient checking)
2. **learning-rate-scheduling** - Adjust LR schedule (might be too high/low/wrong schedule)
3. **optimization-algorithms** - Consider different optimizer if current one unsuitable

**Why this order**: Stability (gradients) → Adaptation (LR) → Algorithm (optimizer)

**Common mistakes:**
- Jumping to change optimizer without checking gradients
- Blaming optimizer when LR is the issue
- Not using gradient monitoring to diagnose

---

### Scenario: Overfitting Issues

**Route to (multi-pronged approach):**
1. **overfitting-prevention** - Implement regularization (dropout, weight decay, early stopping)
2. **data-augmentation-strategies** - Increase effective dataset size
3. **hyperparameter-tuning** - Find optimal regularization strength

**Why all three**: Overfitting needs comprehensive strategy, not single technique.

**Prioritization:**
- Small dataset (< 1K): data-augmentation is MOST critical
- Medium dataset (1K-10K): overfitting-prevention + augmentation balanced
- Large dataset but still overfitting: overfitting-prevention + check model size

---

### Scenario: Training Speed + Memory Constraints

**Route to:**
1. **batch-size-and-memory-tradeoffs** (PRIMARY) - Gradient accumulation to simulate larger batch
2. **pytorch-engineering/tensor-operations-and-memory** - Memory profiling and optimization
3. **data-augmentation-strategies** - Reduce augmentation overhead if bottleneck

**Why**: Speed and memory often coupled—need to balance batch size, memory, and throughput.

---

### Scenario: Multi-Task Learning or Custom Loss

**Route to:**
1. **loss-functions-and-objectives** (PRIMARY) - Multi-task loss design, uncertainty weighting
2. **gradient-management** - Check gradients per task, gradient balancing
3. **hyperparameter-tuning** - Tune task weights, loss coefficients

**Why**: Custom losses need careful design + gradient analysis + tuning.

## Ambiguous Queries - Clarification Protocol

When symptom unclear, ASK ONE diagnostic question before routing:

| Vague Query | Clarifying Question | Why |
|-------------|---------------------|-----|
| "Fix my training" | "What specific issue? Not learning? Unstable? Overfitting? Too slow?" | 4+ different routing paths |
| "Improve model" | "Improve what? Training speed? Accuracy? Generalization?" | Different optimization targets |
| "Training not working well" | "What's 'not working'? Loss behavior? Accuracy? Convergence speed?" | Need specific symptoms |
| "Optimize hyperparameters" | "Which hyperparameters? All of them? Specific ones like LR?" | Specific vs broad search |
| "Model performs poorly" | "Training accuracy poor or validation accuracy poor or both?" | Underfitting vs overfitting |

**Never guess when ambiguous. Ask once, route accurately.**

---

## Common Routing Mistakes

| Symptom | Wrong Route | Correct Route | Why |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-----|
| "Training slow" | batch-size-and-memory | ASK: Check GPU utilization first | Might be data loading, not compute |
| "Not learning" | optimization-algorithms | ASK: Diagnose loss behavior | Could be LR, gradients, loss function |
| "Loss NaN" | learning-rate-scheduling | gradient-management FIRST | Gradient explosion most common cause |
| "Overfitting" | overfitting-prevention only | overfitting-prevention + data-augmentation | Need multi-pronged approach |
| "Need to speed up training" | optimization-algorithms | Profile first (pytorch-engineering) | Don't optimize without measuring |
| "Which optimizer for transformer" | neural-architectures | optimization-algorithms | Optimizer choice, not architecture |

**Key principle**: Diagnosis before solutions, clarification before routing, multi-skill for complex issues.

---

## When NOT to Use Training-Optimization Pack

**Skip training-optimization when:**

| Symptom | Wrong Pack | Correct Pack | Why |
|---------|------------|--------------|-----|
| "CUDA out of memory" | training-optimization | pytorch-engineering | Infrastructure issue, not training algorithm |
| "DDP not working" | training-optimization | pytorch-engineering | Distributed setup, not hyperparameters |
| "Which architecture to use" | training-optimization | neural-architectures | Architecture choice precedes training |
| "Model won't load" | training-optimization | pytorch-engineering | Checkpointing/serialization issue |
| "Inference too slow" | training-optimization | ml-production | Production optimization, not training |
| "How to deploy model" | training-optimization | ml-production | Deployment concern |
| "RL exploration issues" | training-optimization | deep-rl | RL-specific training concern |
| "RLHF for LLM" | training-optimization | llm-specialist | LLM-specific technique |

**Training-optimization pack is for**: Framework-agnostic training algorithms, hyperparameters, optimization techniques, and training strategies that apply across architectures.

**Boundaries:**
- PyTorch implementation/infrastructure → **pytorch-engineering**
- Architecture selection → **neural-architectures**
- Production/inference → **ml-production**
- RL-specific algorithms → **deep-rl**
- LLM-specific techniques → **llm-specialist**

## Red Flags - Stop and Reconsider

If you catch yourself about to:
- ❌ Suggest specific optimizer without routing → Route to **optimization-algorithms**
- ❌ Suggest learning rate value without diagnosis → Route to **learning-rate-scheduling**
- ❌ Say "add dropout" without comprehensive strategy → Route to **overfitting-prevention**
- ❌ Suggest "reduce batch size" without profiling → Check if memory or speed issue, route appropriately
- ❌ Give trial-and-error fixes for NaN → Route to **gradient-management** for systematic debugging
- ❌ Provide generic training advice → Identify specific symptom and route to specialist
- ❌ Accept user's self-diagnosis without verification → Ask diagnostic questions first

**All of these mean: You're about to give incomplete advice. Route to specialist instead.**

---

## Common Rationalizations (Don't Do These)

| Rationalization | Reality | What To Do Instead |
|-----------------|---------|-------------------|
| "User is rushed, skip diagnostic questions" | Diagnosis takes 30 seconds, wrong route wastes 10+ minutes | Ask ONE quick diagnostic question: "Is loss flat, oscillating, or NaN?" |
| "Symptoms are obvious, route immediately" | Symptoms often have multiple causes | Ask clarifying question to eliminate ambiguity |
| "User suggested optimizer change" | User self-diagnosis can be wrong | "What loss behavior are you seeing?" to verify root cause |
| "Expert user doesn't need routing" | Expert users benefit from specialist skills too | Route based on symptoms, not user sophistication |
| "Just a quick question" | Quick questions deserve correct answers | Route to specialist—they have quick diagnostics too |
| "Single solution will fix it" | Training issues often multi-causal | Consider multi-skill routing for complex symptoms |
| "Time pressure means guess quickly" | Wrong guess wastes MORE time | Fast systematic diagnosis faster than trial-and-error |
| "They already tried X" | Maybe tried X wrong or X wasn't the issue | Route to specialist to verify X was done correctly |
| "Too complex to route" | Complex issues need specialists MORE | Use multi-skill routing for complex scenarios |
| "Direct answer is helpful" | Wrong direct answer wastes time | Routing IS the helpful answer |

**If you catch yourself thinking ANY of these, STOP and route to specialist or ask diagnostic question.**

## Pressure Resistance - Critical Discipline

### Time/Emergency Pressure

| Pressure | Wrong Response | Correct Response |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| "Demo tomorrow, need quick fix" | Give untested suggestions | "Fast systematic diagnosis ensures demo success: [question]" |
| "Production training failing" | Panic and guess | "Quick clarification prevents longer outage: [question]" |
| "Just tell me which optimizer" | "Use Adam" | "30-second clarification ensures right choice: [question]" |

**Emergency protocol**: Fast clarification (30 sec) → Correct routing (60 sec) → Specialist handles efficiently

---

### Authority/Hierarchy Pressure

| Pressure | Wrong Response | Correct Response |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| "Senior said use SGD" | Accept without verification | "To apply SGD effectively, let me verify the symptoms: [question]" |
| "PM wants optimizer change" | Change without diagnosis | "Let's diagnose to ensure optimizer is the issue: [question]" |

**Authority protocol**: Acknowledge → Verify symptoms → Route based on evidence, not opinion

---

### User Self-Diagnosis Pressure

| Pressure | Wrong Response | Correct Response |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| "I think it's the optimizer" | Discuss optimizer choice | "What loss behavior makes you think optimizer? [diagnostic]" |
| "Obviously need to clip gradients" | Implement clipping | "What symptoms suggest gradient issues? [verify]" |

**Verification protocol**: User attribution is hypothesis, not diagnosis. Verify with symptoms.

---

## Red Flags Checklist - Self-Check Before Routing

Before giving ANY training advice or routing, ask yourself:

1. ❓ **Did I identify specific symptoms?**
   - If no → Ask clarifying question
   - If yes → Proceed

2. ❓ **Is this symptom in my routing table?**
   - If yes → Route to specialist skill
   - If no → Ask diagnostic question

3. ❓ **Am I about to give direct advice?**
   - If yes → STOP. Why am I not routing?
   - Check rationalization table—am I making excuses?

4. ❓ **Could this symptom have multiple causes?**
   - If yes → Ask diagnostic question to narrow down
   - If no → Route confidently

5. ❓ **Is this training-optimization or another pack?**
   - PyTorch errors → pytorch-engineering
   - Architecture choice → neural-architectures
   - Deployment → ml-production

6. ❓ **Am I feeling pressure to skip routing?**
   - Time pressure → Route anyway (faster overall)
   - Authority pressure → Verify symptoms anyway
   - User self-diagnosis → Confirm with questions anyway
   - Expert user → Route anyway (specialists help experts too)

**If you failed ANY check, do NOT give direct advice. Route to specialist or ask clarifying question.**
