# Using UX Designer

## Overview

This meta-skill routes you to the right UX design skills based on your situation. Load this skill when you need UX expertise but aren't sure which specific skill to use.

**Core Principle**: Different UX tasks require different skills. Match your situation to the appropriate skill, load only what you need.

## When to Use

Load this skill when:
- Starting any UX/UI design task
- User mentions: "design", "UX", "UI", "interface", "user experience", "layout", "navigation"
- You need to critique or review a design
- You need to create a new interface or feature
- User asks about UX principles or concepts

**Don't use for**: Backend logic, database design, pure technical implementation without UX implications

## How to Access Reference Sheets

**IMPORTANT**: All reference sheets are located in the SAME DIRECTORY as this SKILL.md file.

When this skill is loaded from:
  `skills/using-ux-designer/SKILL.md`

Reference sheets like `ux-fundamentals.md` are at:
  `skills/using-ux-designer/ux-fundamentals.md`

NOT at:
  `skills/ux-fundamentals.md` ← WRONG PATH

When you see a link like `[ux-fundamentals.md](ux-fundamentals.md)`, read the file from the same directory as this SKILL.md.

## Routing by Situation

### Learning & Explanation

**Symptoms**: "What is...", "Explain...", "Teach me about...", "How does X work in UX?"

**Route to**: [ux-fundamentals.md](ux-fundamentals.md)

**Examples**:
- "What is information architecture?" → [ux-fundamentals.md](ux-fundamentals.md)
- "Explain visual hierarchy" → [ux-fundamentals.md](ux-fundamentals.md)
- "How do I think about accessibility?" → [ux-fundamentals.md](ux-fundamentals.md)

---

### Design Critique & Review

**Symptoms**: "Review this design", "Critique this interface", "Is this usable?", "Does this follow best practices?"

**Route to**: Relevant competency skills based on critique focus

**General Review** (no specific focus):
- [visual-design-foundations.md](visual-design-foundations.md) (visual hierarchy, color, typography)
- [information-architecture.md](information-architecture.md) (content organization, navigation)
- [accessibility-and-inclusive-design.md](accessibility-and-inclusive-design.md) (WCAG, inclusive design)

**Specific Focus**:
- Visual issues (color, contrast, hierarchy) → [visual-design-foundations.md](visual-design-foundations.md)
- Navigation/findability issues → [information-architecture.md](information-architecture.md)
- Interaction feedback, touch targets → [interaction-design-patterns.md](interaction-design-patterns.md)
- Accessibility concerns → [accessibility-and-inclusive-design.md](accessibility-and-inclusive-design.md)

**Add platform extension** if design is platform-specific:
- Mobile app → Add [mobile-design-patterns.md](mobile-design-patterns.md)
- Web dashboard → Add [web-application-design.md](web-application-design.md)
- Desktop software → Add [desktop-software-design.md](desktop-software-design.md)
- Game interface → Add [game-ui-design.md](game-ui-design.md)

---

### New Interface Design

**Symptoms**: "Design a...", "Create interface for...", "Build a [feature] screen"

**Route to**: Competency skills + platform extension

**Standard Web/Mobile Feature**:
1. [visual-design-foundations.md](visual-design-foundations.md) (layout, hierarchy, color)
2. [interaction-design-patterns.md](interaction-design-patterns.md) (buttons, feedback, states)
3. Platform-specific:
   - Mobile → [mobile-design-patterns.md](mobile-design-patterns.md)
   - Web app → [web-application-design.md](web-application-design.md)

**Complex Navigation/IA**:
1. [information-architecture.md](information-architecture.md) (content structure, nav systems)
2. [visual-design-foundations.md](visual-design-foundations.md) (visual hierarchy)
3. Platform extension as needed

**Research Phase** (early discovery):
1. [user-research-and-validation.md](user-research-and-validation.md) (understand users first)
2. Then return to design skills once research complete
