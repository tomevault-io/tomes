# Using Simulation Tactics: The Router Meta-Skill

## Description

This is the PRIMARY ROUTER META-SKILL for the simulation-tactics skillpack. It teaches you how to:

1. **Analyze simulation requirements** - Understand what the user actually needs
2. **Route to appropriate skills** - Determine which of the 10 core skills apply
3. **Apply skills in correct order** - Use the optimal workflow for the situation
4. **Combine multiple skills** - Handle complex scenarios requiring several simulation types

This skill does NOT teach simulation implementation details. It teaches DECISION MAKING: which skill to use, when, and why.

## When to Use This Meta-Skill

Use this meta-skill when:
- Starting ANY simulation-related game development task
- User asks about simulation but unclear which type
- Facing complex scenarios requiring multiple simulation types
- Need to determine implementation order for multi-system games
- Debugging simulation issues and unclear where to start
- Planning architecture for simulation-heavy games

## How to Access Reference Sheets

**IMPORTANT**: All reference sheets are located in the SAME DIRECTORY as this SKILL.md file.

When this skill is loaded from:
  `skills/using-simulation-tactics/SKILL.md`

Reference sheets like `physics-simulation-patterns.md` are at:
  `skills/using-simulation-tactics/physics-simulation-patterns.md`

NOT at:
  `skills/physics-simulation-patterns.md` ← WRONG PATH

## The 10 Core Skills

Before routing, understand what each skill provides:

### 1. simulation-vs-faking (FOUNDATIONAL)
**What it teaches**: The fundamental trade-off between full simulation and approximation/faking
**When to route**: ALWAYS FIRST - determines if you even need simulation
**Key question**: "Do I simulate this, fake it, or use a hybrid approach?"

### 2. physics-simulation-patterns
**What it teaches**: Rigid bodies, vehicles, cloth, fluids, integration methods
**When to route**: Need realistic physics for vehicles, ragdolls, destructibles, or fluid dynamics
**Key question**: "Does this need real-time physics simulation?"

### 3. ai-and-agent-simulation
**What it teaches**: FSM, behavior trees, utility AI, GOAP, agent behaviors
**When to route**: Need intelligent agent behavior (enemies, NPCs, units)
**Key question**: "Do agents need to make decisions and act autonomously?"

### 4. traffic-and-pathfinding
**What it teaches**: A*, navmesh, flow fields, traffic simulation, congestion
**When to route**: Need agents to navigate environments or simulate traffic
**Key question**: "Do entities need to find paths or simulate traffic flow?"

### 5. economic-simulation-patterns
**What it teaches**: Supply/demand, markets, trade networks, price discovery
**When to route**: Need economic systems (trading, markets, resources)
**Key question**: "Does the game involve trade, economy, or resource markets?"

### 6. ecosystem-simulation
**What it teaches**: Predator-prey dynamics, food chains, population control
**When to route**: Need living ecosystems with wildlife populations
**Key question**: "Do I need animals/plants that breed, eat, and die naturally?"

### 7. crowd-simulation
**What it teaches**: Boids, formations, social forces, LOD for crowds
**When to route**: Need large groups moving together (crowds, flocks, armies)
**Key question**: "Do I need many entities moving as a coordinated group?"

### 8. weather-and-time
**What it teaches**: Day/night cycles, weather systems, seasonal effects
**When to route**: Need atmospheric effects or time-based gameplay
**Key question**: "Does the game need time progression or weather?"

### 9. performance-optimization-for-sims
**What it teaches**: Profiling, spatial partitioning, LOD, time-slicing, caching
**When to route**: Performance problems with existing simulation
**Key question**: "Is my simulation too slow?"

### 10. debugging-simulation-chaos
**What it teaches**: Systematic debugging, desync detection, determinism, chaos prevention
**When to route**: Simulation behaves incorrectly, chaotically, or unpredictably
**Key question**: "Is my simulation broken, desyncing, or chaotic?"

### Key Routing Principles

**Principle 1: simulation-vs-faking is ALWAYS step 1**
- Even if you "know" you need simulation, validate this assumption
- Prevents 90% of over-engineering disasters
- Takes 5 minutes, saves hours of wasted work

**Principle 2: Multiple domains are common**
- Most games need 2-4 simulation types
- Route to ALL applicable skills
- Order matters (see [multi-skill-workflows.md](multi-skill-workflows.md))

**Principle 3: Optimization comes AFTER implementation**
- Don't route to performance-optimization-for-sims until you have a working simulation
- Profile first, optimize later
- Premature optimization is the root of all evil

**Principle 4: Debugging is reactive, not proactive**
- Only route to debugging-simulation-chaos when something is broken
- Don't use it as a preventative measure
- Fix the bug, THEN refactor to prevent recurrence

[Is simulation ALREADY implemented?]
    ├─ No → Use identified skill(s) to implement
    └─ Yes → Continue
        ↓
[Is there a PERFORMANCE problem?]

## COMMON ROUTING MISTAKES

These are the mistakes that waste the most time. Learn to recognize them.

### Mistake 1: Skipping simulation-vs-faking

**Symptom**: Over-engineered simulation that could have been faked

**Example**:
- Building full ecosystem for background birds that are never scrutinized
- Simulating NPC hunger/sleep when player never notices
- Full traffic simulation for distant cars player can't interact with

**Fix**: ALWAYS route to simulation-vs-faking first. Ask "Will player notice if I fake this?"

**Cost of mistake**: Weeks of wasted work, ongoing performance burden

### Mistake 2: Premature optimization

**Symptom**: Routing to performance-optimization-for-sims before implementation is complete

**Example**:
- Implementing LOD systems before having working simulation
- Using spatial partitioning before knowing if it's needed
- Caching pathfinding before pathfinding exists

**Fix**: Profile first, optimize later. Only route to performance-optimization-for-sims when:
- You have working simulation
- You have measured performance problem
- Profiler shows bottleneck

**Cost of mistake**: Wasted time optimizing code that might change, or optimizing the wrong thing

### Mistake 3: Not debugging systematically

**Symptom**: Trying to fix bugs by changing random things, routing to implementation skills instead of debugging-simulation-chaos

**Example**:
- "Physics explodes, let me try different integration method" (should debug first)
- "Ecosystem collapses, let me add more food" (should debug why it collapses)
- "Pathfinding breaks, let me rewrite the algorithm" (should debug the existing code)

**Fix**: When simulation is broken, ALWAYS route to debugging-simulation-chaos first. Identify root cause before attempting fixes.

**Cost of mistake**: Bug persists, or you "fix" symptom without addressing cause

### Mistake 4: Wrong skill for the domain

**Symptom**: Using ai-and-agent-simulation when you need traffic-and-pathfinding, etc.

**Example**:
- Using ai-and-agent-simulation for pathfinding (use traffic-and-pathfinding instead)
- Using physics-simulation-patterns for kinematic movement (use ai-and-agent-simulation)
- Using crowd-simulation for trading (use economic-simulation-patterns)

**Fix**: Understand what each skill covers. Pathfinding is NOT AI. Physics is NOT movement. Crowds are NOT flocking AI.

**Cost of mistake**: Learning wrong techniques for your problem

### Mistake 5: Implementing in wrong order

**Symptom**: Building dependent system before foundation

**Example**:
- Implementing AI behaviors before pathfinding exists (AI can't move)
- Building economy before resource sources exist (nothing to trade)
- Adding weather effects before day/night cycle (no time progression)

**Fix**: Follow the dependency order in multi-skill workflows. Foundation first, then dependent systems.

**Cost of mistake**: Rework when foundation changes breaks dependent systems

### Mistake 6: Ignoring multiplayer determinism

**Symptom**: Building single-player simulation without considering multiplayer needs

**Example**:
- Using floating-point physics for multiplayer game (desyncs)
- Random number generation without shared seed (desyncs)
- Iterating unordered collections (desyncs)

**Fix**: If multiplayer is planned, route to debugging-simulation-chaos early to learn determinism requirements.

**Cost of mistake**: Complete rewrite to fix desyncs

### Mistake 7: Over-combining skills

**Symptom**: Trying to use every skill when only 1-2 are needed

**Example**:
- Simple puzzle game doesn't need ecosystem-simulation
- Turn-based game doesn't need performance-optimization-for-sims
- Static world doesn't need weather-and-time

**Fix**: Route to ONLY the skills you actually need. More skills = more complexity.

**Cost of mistake**: Wasted time learning and implementing unnecessary systems
