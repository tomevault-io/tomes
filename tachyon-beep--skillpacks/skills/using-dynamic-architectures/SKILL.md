# Dynamic Architectures Meta-Skill

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this meta-skill when you encounter:

- **Growing Networks**: Adding capacity during training (new layers, neurons, modules)
- **Pruning Networks**: Removing capacity that isn't contributing
- **Continual Learning**: Training on new tasks without forgetting old ones
- **Gradient Isolation**: Training new modules without destabilizing existing weights
- **Modular Composition**: Building networks from graftable, composable components
- **Lifecycle Management**: State machines controlling when to grow, train, integrate, prune
- **Progressive Training**: Staged capability expansion with warmup and cooldown

This is the **entry point** for dynamic/morphogenetic neural network patterns. It routes to 7 specialized reference sheets.

## How to Access Reference Sheets

**IMPORTANT**: All reference sheets are located in the SAME DIRECTORY as this SKILL.md file.

When this skill is loaded from:
  `skills/using-dynamic-architectures/SKILL.md`

Reference sheets like `continual-learning-foundations.md` are at:
  `skills/using-dynamic-architectures/continual-learning-foundations.md`

NOT at:
  `skills/continual-learning-foundations.md` (WRONG PATH)

## Core Principle

**Dynamic architectures grow capability, not just tune weights.**

Static networks are a guess about capacity. Dynamic networks let training signal drive structure. The challenge is growing without forgetting, integrating without destabilizing, and knowing when to act.

Key tensions:
- **Stability vs. Plasticity**: Preserve existing knowledge while adding new capacity
- **Isolation vs. Integration**: Train new modules separately, then merge carefully
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: When to add capacity vs. when to stabilize

## The 7 Dynamic Architecture Skills

1. **continual-learning-foundations** - EWC, PackNet, rehearsal strategies, catastrophic forgetting theory
2. **gradient-isolation-techniques** - Freezing, gradient masking, stop_grad patterns, alpha blending
3. **peft-adapter-techniques** - LoRA, QLoRA, DoRA, adapter placement, merging strategies
4. **dynamic-architecture-patterns** - Grow/prune patterns, slot-based expansion, capacity scheduling
5. **modular-neural-composition** - MoE, gating, grafting semantics, interface contracts
6. **ml-lifecycle-orchestration** - State machines, quality gates, transition triggers, controllers
7. **progressive-training-strategies** - Staged expansion, warmup/cooldown, knowledge transfer

## Routing Decision Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Core Problem

**Diagnostic Questions:**

- "Are you trying to prevent forgetting when training on new data/tasks?"
- "Are you trying to add new capacity to an existing trained network?"
- "Are you designing how multiple modules combine?"
- "Are you deciding WHEN to grow, prune, or integrate?"

**Quick Routing:**

| "Model forgets old tasks when I train new ones" | continual-learning-foundations |
| "New module destabilizes existing weights" | gradient-isolation-techniques |
| "Fine-tune LLM efficiently without full training" | peft-adapter-techniques |
| "When should I add more capacity?" | dynamic-architecture-patterns |

## Rationalization Resistance Table

| Rationalization | Reality | Counter-Guidance |
|-----------------|---------|------------------|
| "Just train a bigger model from scratch" | Transfer + growth often beats from-scratch | "Check continual-learning-foundations for why" |
| "I'll freeze everything except the new layer" | Full freeze may be too restrictive | "Check gradient-isolation-techniques for partial strategies" |
| "I'll add capacity whenever loss plateaus" | Need more than loss plateau (contribution check) | "Check ml-lifecycle-orchestration for proper gates" |
| "Modules can just sum their outputs" | Naive summation can cause interference | "Check modular-neural-composition for combination mechanisms" |
| "I'll integrate immediately when training finishes" | Need warmup/holding period | "Check progressive-training-strategies for safe integration" |
| "EWC solves all forgetting problems" | EWC has limitations, may need architectural approach | "Check continual-learning-foundations for trade-offs" |

---

## Red Flags Checklist

Watch for these signs of incorrect approach:

- [ ] **No Isolation**: Training new modules without gradient isolation from host
- [ ] **No Warmup**: Integrating new capacity at full amplitude immediately
- [ ] **No Gates**: Integrating based only on time, not performance metrics
- [ ] **Naive Combination**: Summing module outputs without gating or blending
- [ ] **Ignoring Forgetting**: Adding new tasks without measuring old task performance
- [ ] **No Rollback**: No plan for what happens if integration fails

## Relationship to Other Packs

| Request | Primary Pack | Why |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| "Implement PPO for architecture decisions" | yzmir-deep-rl | RL algorithm implementation |
| "Evaluate architecture changes without mutation" | yzmir-deep-rl/counterfactual-reasoning | Counterfactual simulation |
| "Debug PyTorch gradient flow" | yzmir-pytorch-engineering | Low-level PyTorch debugging |
| "Optimize training loop performance" | yzmir-training-optimization | General training optimization |
| "Design transformer architecture" | yzmir-neural-architectures | Static architecture design |
| "Deploy morphogenetic model" | yzmir-ml-production | Production deployment |

**Intersection with deep-rl:** If using RL to control architecture decisions (when to grow/prune), combine this pack's lifecycle orchestration with deep-rl's policy gradient or actor-critic methods.

**Counterfactual evaluation:** Before committing to a live mutation (grow/prune), use deep-rl's `counterfactual-reasoning.md` to simulate the change and evaluate outcomes without risk. This is critical for production morphogenetic systems.

## Diagnostic Question Templates

Use these to route users:

### Problem Classification

- "Are you training on multiple tasks sequentially, or growing a single-task network?"
- "Do you have an existing trained model you want to extend, or starting fresh?"
- "Is the issue forgetting (old performance drops) or instability (training explodes)?"

### Architectural Questions

- "Where do new modules attach to the existing network?"
- "How should new module outputs combine with existing outputs?"
- "What triggers growth? Loss plateau, manual, or learned?"

### Lifecycle Questions

- "What states can a module be in? (training, integrating, permanent, removed)"
- "What conditions must be met before integration?"
- "What happens if a module fails to improve performance?"
