# Using Deep RL Meta-Skill

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this meta-skill when you encounter:

- **RL Implementation**: Implementing reinforcement learning algorithms (Q-learning, DQN, PPO, SAC, etc.)
- **Agent Training**: Training agents in environments (games, robotics, control systems)
- **Sequential Decision-Making**: Problems requiring learning from trial and error
- **Policy Optimization**: Learning policies that maximize cumulative rewards
- **RL Debugging**: Debugging training issues, agents not learning, reward problems

This is the **entry point** for the deep-rl pack. It routes to 13 specialized skills based on problem characteristics.

## How to Access Reference Sheets

**IMPORTANT**: All reference sheets are located in the SAME DIRECTORY as this SKILL.md file.

When this skill is loaded from:
  `skills/using-deep-rl/SKILL.md`

Reference sheets like `rl-foundations.md` are at:
  `skills/using-deep-rl/rl-foundations.md`

NOT at:
  `skills/rl-foundations.md` ← WRONG PATH

## Core Principle

**Problem type determines algorithm family.**

The correct approach depends on:

1. **Action Space**: Discrete (button presses) vs Continuous (joint angles)
2. **Data Regime**: Online (interact with environment) vs Offline (fixed dataset)
3. **Experience Level**: Need foundations vs ready to implement
4. **Special Requirements**: Multi-agent, model-based, exploration, reward design

**Always clarify the problem BEFORE suggesting algorithms.**

## Routing Decision Framework

### Step 1: Assess Experience Level

- If user asks "what is RL" or "how does RL work" → **rl-foundations**
- If confused about value vs policy, on-policy vs off-policy → **rl-foundations**
- If user has specific problem and RL background → Continue to Step 2

**Why foundations first:** Cannot implement algorithms without understanding MDPs, Bellman equations, and exploration-exploitation tradeoffs.

### Step 2: Classify Action Space

#### Discrete Actions (buttons, menu selections, discrete signals)

| Condition | Route To | Why |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| Small action space (< 100) + online | **value-based-methods** (DQN) | Q-networks excel at discrete |
| Large action space OR need policy flexibility | **policy-gradient-methods** (PPO) | Scales to larger spaces |

#### Continuous Actions (joint angles, motor forces, steering)

| Condition | Route To | Why |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| Sample efficiency critical | **actor-critic-methods** (SAC) | Off-policy, automatic entropy |
| Stability critical | **actor-critic-methods** (TD3) | Deterministic, handles overestimation |
| Simplicity preferred | **policy-gradient-methods** (PPO) | On-policy, simpler |

**CRITICAL:** NEVER suggest DQN for continuous actions. DQN requires discrete actions.

### Step 3: Identify Data Regime

#### Online Learning (Agent Interacts with Environment)
- Discrete → **value-based-methods** OR **policy-gradient-methods**
- Continuous → **actor-critic-methods**
- Sample efficiency critical → Consider **model-based-rl**

#### Offline Learning (Fixed Dataset, No Interaction)
→ **offline-rl** (CQL, IQL)

**Red Flag:** If user has fixed dataset and suggests DQN/PPO/SAC, STOP and route to **offline-rl**. Standard algorithms assume online interaction and will fail.

### Step 4: Special Problem Types

| Problem | Route To | Key Consideration |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Multiple agents | **multi-agent-rl** | Non-stationarity, credit assignment |
| Sample efficiency extreme | **model-based-rl** | Learns environment model |
| Counterfactual/causal | **counterfactual-reasoning** | HER, off-policy evaluation |

### Step 5: Debugging and Infrastructure

| Problem | Route To | Why |
|---------|----------|-----|
| "Not learning" / reward flat | **rl-debugging** FIRST | 80% of issues are bugs, not algorithms |
| Exploration problems | **exploration-strategies** | Curiosity, RND, intrinsic motivation |
| Reward design issues | **reward-shaping** | Potential-based shaping, inverse RL |
| Environment setup | **rl-environments** | Gym API, wrappers, vectorization |
| Evaluation questions | **rl-evaluation** | Deterministic vs stochastic, multiple seeds |

**Red Flag:** If user immediately wants to change algorithms because "it's not learning," route to **rl-debugging** first.

## Rationalization Resistance Table

| Rationalization | Reality | Counter-Guidance |
|-----------------|---------|------------------|
| "Just use PPO for everything" | PPO is general but not optimal for all cases | Clarify: discrete or continuous? Sample efficiency constraints? |
| "DQN for continuous actions" | DQN requires discrete actions | Use SAC or TD3 for continuous |
| "Offline RL is just RL on a dataset" | Offline has distribution shift, needs special algorithms | Route to offline-rl for CQL, IQL |
| "More data always helps" | Sample efficiency and distribution matter | Off-policy vs on-policy matters |
| "My algorithm isn't learning, I need a better one" | Usually bugs, not algorithm | Route to rl-debugging first |
| "I'll discretize continuous actions for DQN" | Discretization loses precision, explodes action space | Use actor-critic-methods |
| "Epsilon-greedy is enough for exploration" | Complex environments need sophisticated exploration | Route to exploration-strategies |
| "I'll just increase the reward when it doesn't learn" | Reward scaling breaks learning | Route to rl-debugging |
| "I can reuse online RL code for offline data" | Offline needs conservative algorithms | Route to offline-rl |
| "Test reward lower than training = overfitting" | Exploration vs exploitation difference | Route to rl-evaluation |

## Red Flags Checklist

Watch for these signs of incorrect routing:

- [ ] **Algorithm-First Thinking**: Recommending algorithm before asking about action space, data regime
- [ ] **DQN for Continuous**: Suggesting DQN/Q-learning for continuous action spaces
- [ ] **Offline Blindness**: Not recognizing fixed dataset requires offline-rl
- [ ] **PPO Cargo-Culting**: Defaulting to PPO without considering alternatives
- [ ] **No Problem Characterization**: Not asking: discrete vs continuous? online vs offline?
- [ ] **Skipping Foundations**: Implementing algorithms when user doesn't understand RL basics
- [ ] **Debug-Last**: Suggesting algorithm changes before systematic debugging
- [ ] **Sample Efficiency Ignorance**: Not asking about sample constraints

**If any red flag triggered → STOP → Ask diagnostic questions → Route correctly**

## Diagnostic Questions

### Action Space
- "Discrete choices or continuous values?"
- "How many actions? Small (< 100), large, or infinite?"

### Data Regime
- "Can agent interact with environment, or fixed dataset?"
- "Online learning or offline?"

### Experience Level
- "New to RL, or specific problem?"
- "Understand MDPs, value functions, policy gradients?"

### Special Requirements
- "Multiple agents? Cooperate or compete?"
- "Sample efficiency critical? How many episodes?"
- "Sparse reward (only at goal) or dense (every step)?"

## Final Reminders

- **Problem characterization BEFORE algorithm selection**
- **DQN for discrete ONLY** (never continuous)
- **Offline data needs offline-rl** (CQL, IQL)
- **PPO is not universal** (good general-purpose, not optimal everywhere)
- **Debug before changing algorithms** (route to rl-debugging)
- **Ask questions, don't assume** (action space? data regime?)
