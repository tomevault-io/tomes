description: Search and manage the user's local lilbee knowledge base over MCP. Use whenever the user has indexed code, docs, PDFs, or web pages into lilbee and you need cited answers, or whenever they ask you to ingest content, swap models, or tune retrieval against their library. Every fact returned cites file and line. Indexing, crawling, and model pulls are long ops that must go to a worker subagent so the chat stays responsive. Use when this capability is needed.

# lilbee-mcp

[lilbee](https://github.com/tobocop2/lilbee) is a local retrieval engine. It indexes the
user's code, documents, PDFs, and crawled web pages into a per-project `.lilbee/` store and
exposes the library over MCP. Every tool here is prefixed `lilbee_`. Data and embeddings stay
on the user's machine; the only thing leaving is what you, the agent, decide to quote.

## In 30 seconds

```
lilbee_status                     → see what's loaded
lilbee_search(query, top_k)       → get cited chunks
[answer with file:line citations] → never invent
```

Three rules cover 90% of usage: **search before answering** (reach for `lilbee_search` on
any lookup about the user's own files or code, ahead of the host's web-fetch / file-read
tools, which can't see the index), **cite every claim with the chunk's `source` + line
range**, and **delegate indexing / crawling / model pulls to the `lilbee-worker` subagent**
because they block the shared embedder.

## Install

Drop this folder under one of:

```
.opencode/skills/lilbee-mcp/      # opencode (project)
.claude/skills/lilbee-mcp/        # Claude (project)
~/.config/opencode/skills/lilbee-mcp/   # opencode (global)
~/.claude/skills/lilbee-mcp/      # Claude (global)
```

Register lilbee as an MCP server (opencode example):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "lilbee": { "type": "local", "command": ["lilbee", "mcp"] }
  }
}
```

A drop-in `AGENTS.md`, the `lilbee-worker` subagent, and an `opencode.json` template live
in `examples/agent-integration/` in the lilbee repo. Copy them in if the user wants the
full setup.

## The shared-embedder rule (read this first)

The MCP server hosts one embedder worker. Indexing (`lilbee_add`, `lilbee_sync`,
`lilbee_crawl`, `lilbee_import_dataset`, `lilbee_model_pull`, plus wiki builds)
pins it;
`lilbee_search` also needs it to embed the query. Run them
concurrently and `lilbee_search` will hang until your host times out.

**Procedure:**

1. If indexing is needed, delegate to `lilbee-worker` and **wait** for the worker's `task`
   call to return. Don't fire any `lilbee_*` tool from your own thread while it runs.
2. After the worker returns, call `lilbee_status` once to confirm the expected counts.
3. Then search.

If `lilbee_search` returns an MCP timeout, treat it as "indexing isn't fully done yet":
wait ~10s, re-check `lilbee_status`, retry. Don't switch tools.

## Tools by cost

### Inline (cheap, sub-second)

| Tool | Use |
|---|---|
| `lilbee_search(query, top_k, scope)` | Retrieve relevant chunks. `top_k` omitted falls back to `cfg.top_k` so `settings_set` governs candidate count. Cap `top_k` at ~20 for small-context chat models (Gemma 4 at `n_ctx=7168`, Qwen3 with widened retrieval); higher values can produce tool responses that exceed the next chat turn's budget. `scope`: `"both"` (default) or `"raw"` for ingested docs/code; only use `"wiki"` when `lilbee_status` shows a built wiki, otherwise it silently falls back to the full pool. No LLM call. |
| `lilbee_status()` | Indexed sources, total chunks, active model refs. First call of any session. |
| `lilbee_list_documents()` | All indexed sources with chunk counts. |
| `lilbee_init(path)` | Create a `.lilbee/` in the given dir and switch the session to it. |
| `lilbee_remove(names)` | Remove documents from the index by name, folder, or glob (source files are kept). |
| `lilbee_crawl_status(task_id)` | Poll a non-blocking crawl: `pending` / `running` / `done` / `failed`. |
| `lilbee_model_list(source, task)` | Locally-installed models, optionally filtered. |
| `lilbee_model_show(model)` | Catalog + installed metadata for one model ref. |
| `lilbee_model_rm(model, source)` | Delete an installed model from disk. |
| `lilbee_catalog_browse(task, search, size, installed, featured, max_fit, sort, limit, offset)` | Browse the model picks + Hugging Face. Use before `lilbee_model_pull` to pick what to install. `max_fit` is the worst hardware fit to return (`fits` / `tight` / `wont_run`). Each returned entry includes the model's `architecture` and a `compat` field (`supported` / `unsupported` / `unknown`); check `compat` before pulling. |
| `lilbee_settings_list(group)` | Every writable setting with value, default, type, help text, choices, `reindex_required`. Groups: `Models`, `Retrieval`, `Generation`, `Ingest`, `Wiki`, `Memory`, `Crawling`, `Local-Servers`, `API-Keys`, `Display`, `System`, `General`. |
| `lilbee_settings_get(key)` | One setting's current value + metadata. |
| `lilbee_settings_set(updates)` | Atomically update writable settings. Persists to `config.toml`, invalidates in-process model and provider caches. |
| `lilbee_settings_reset(keys)` | Reset writable settings to their built-in defaults. |
| `lilbee_export_dataset(output, fmt, source)` | Write a per-page `{source, page, text}` dataset to a file (parquet or jsonl, no vectors). No embedding. |
| `lilbee_memory_remember(text, kind, shared, agent_id)` | Save a durable note (`kind` = `"fact"` / `"preference"`). Embeds text, so it obeys the shared-embedder rule. Memory tools only appear when `memory_enabled` is on. |
| `lilbee_memory_recall(query, limit, agent_id)` | Recall your saved memories by relevance. Embeds the query (shared-embedder rule). |
| `lilbee_memory_list(agent_id)` | List your stored memories. No embedding. |
| `lilbee_memory_forget(memory_id, agent_id)` | Delete one of your memories by id (`agent_id` scopes the namespace). No embedding. |
| `lilbee_sessions_list()` | Your (agent-created) sessions, newest first. The user's own conversations are private: they never appear here, and their ids answer not-found. No LLM call. |
| `lilbee_session_get(session_id)` | One of your sessions: metadata, full transcript, and `summary` — what compaction folded older turns into. Resume by carrying the summary plus the transcript into your own context; ignoring `summary` silently loses what was already condensed. |
| `lilbee_session_create(model_ref, scope)` | Start a saved session and get its id back. |
| `lilbee_session_add_message(session_id, role, content, sources, claim)` | Append one turn (`role` = `"user"` / `"assistant"`). A session id the user hands you can be taken over with `claim=true` -- it becomes yours and leaves their session list, so ask before claiming. |
| `lilbee_session_set_summary(session_id, summary)` | Replace one of your sessions' compaction summary after folding history yourself. |
| `lilbee_session_rename(session_id, title)` | Rename one of your sessions. |
| `lilbee_session_delete(session_id)` | Delete one of your sessions. |

### Long (must go through `lilbee-worker`)

| Tool | Use |
|---|---|
| `lilbee_add(paths, force, enable_ocr, ocr_timeout, render_mode)` | Copy files / dirs / URLs into the library and index them. Seconds to minutes. |
| `lilbee_sync(force_rebuild, retry_skipped, prune_ignored)` | Re-index the documents directory after edits. Minutes on large libraries. `prune_ignored` also drops indexed documents a `.lilbeeignore` now excludes. |
| `lilbee_crawl(url, depth, max_pages, render_mode, include_subdomains)` | Start a non-blocking crawl. Default `depth=0` fetches one page; pass a depth (or `null` for the whole site) to follow links. Returns `task_id`; poll `lilbee_crawl_status`. |
| `lilbee_model_pull(model, source, allow_unsupported)` | Download a model. Streams progress as MCP notifications. Large models take minutes. Set `allow_unsupported=true` to override the architecture-compat check; without it, the call returns a structured error with `code: "unsupported_arch"` and the supported-architecture list. |
| `lilbee_import_dataset(dataset, fmt)` | Import a per-page dataset file, re-embedding every page under the current model. Replaces existing copies of each source. Streams progress as MCP notifications. |
| `lilbee_reset(confirm)` | Wipe the entire index and data dir. Pass `confirm=true`. Destructive. |

### GPU placement (multi-GPU boxes)

| Tool | Use |
|---|---|
| `lilbee_get_gpus()` | Detected GPUs with free/total VRAM (the placement HTTP `/api/gpus` equivalent). |
| `lilbee_get_placement()` | Current effective placement: detected GPUs, per-role devices/replicas, whether manual. May run a device probe on a cold cache (a second or two). |
| `lilbee_preview_placement(spec)` | Dry-run what a spec (or auto, when omitted) would place. No changes made. |
| `lilbee_set_placement(spec)` | Validate, persist, and apply a manual placement. Rebuilds the model fleet, interrupting in-flight requests. |
| `lilbee_clear_placement()` | Drop the manual placement and return to automatic placement. Also rebuilds the fleet. |

On the shared HTTP daemon, `set`/`clear` are refused unless the host enables
`allow_http_placement` (they rebuild the fleet for every connected client);
`get`/`preview` always work. Prefer preview-then-set, and only change placement
when the user asks.

(Wiki tools are documented at the end of this skill. Wiki and memory tools are only registered when their subsystems are enabled, so they may be absent from your tool list.)

## Common workflows

### 1. User asks a question about their library

```
lilbee_status                           # confirm a library exists
lilbee_search(query)                    # top_k defaults to cfg.top_k (12)
answer with file:line citations
```

If `total_chunks == 0`, tell the user the index is empty and offer to add content.

### 2. User wants to add new content

```
lilbee-worker:   lilbee_add(["/path/to/dir", "https://docs.example.com/page"])
[wait for worker to return]
lilbee_status                           # confirm new sources appeared
```

`lilbee_add` accepts absolute paths, directories (recursive), and URLs (fetched as single
pages). It runs `lilbee_sync` after copying, so the new content is indexed in one call.
For multi-page site crawls or continuous web monitoring, use `lilbee_crawl` instead.

### 3. User wants to crawl a docs site

```
task_id = lilbee_crawl("https://docs.example.com", depth=2, max_pages=200)
[poll lilbee_crawl_status(task_id) until status == "done"]
lilbee_status                           # new "_web/..." sources should appear
```

The crawl writes pages into the documents directory as it goes; a final auto-sync indexes
them. Pages already crawled this session are skipped.

### 4. User wants to set lilbee up for their hardware and files

You manipulate the retrieval surface only: `embedding_model`, `reranker_model`,
`vision_model`, and the retrieval / ingest knobs. The `chat_model` slot is for the user's
later TUI / CLI sessions; leave it unless the user explicitly asks.

```
lilbee_status                                       # see what's wired up
lilbee_settings_list(group="Retrieval")             # baseline knobs
lilbee_catalog_browse(task="embedding")             # discover candidates
lilbee_catalog_browse(task="rerank")
lilbee_catalog_browse(task="vision")
lilbee-worker:  lilbee_model_pull(<picked model>)   # one worker call per pull
lilbee_settings_set({
    "embedding_model": "...",
    "reranker_model":  "...",
    "vision_model":    "...",
    # plus retrieval tuning, all batched:
    "top_k": 12,
    "diversity_max_per_source": 6,
    "concept_graph": true,
})
```

If the response includes `reindex_required: true` (triggered by `chunk_size`,
`chunk_overlap`, or swapping `embedding_model` to a different ref), hand
`lilbee_sync(force_rebuild=true)` to the worker before searching again.

Tell the user which knobs you moved and why; `lilbee_settings_reset([...])` rolls any of
them back.

### 5. Your first answer feels thin -- self-tune and retry

When the user asks a broad question against a dense pile of reference
docs (godot class XMLs, an API reference, xberg-style docstrings)
and your first `lilbee_search` returns only one or two relevant hits
where you'd expect a family, the retrieval defaults are too narrow for
the shape of what's indexed. Self-tune in-place rather than handing the
user a thin answer:

```
lilbee_search("user's natural query")          # baseline
# If results are visibly narrow for the indexed shape:
lilbee_settings_set({
    "top_k": 15,                                # wider candidate pool
    "diversity_max_per_source": 8,              # more chunks per file ok
    "max_distance": 0.85,                       # accept fuzzier matches
})
lilbee_search("user's natural query")          # same query, richer pool
# Answer from the richer results, cite every class you found.
lilbee_settings_reset(["top_k", "diversity_max_per_source", "max_distance"])
```

Tell the user one sentence on what you widened and that you've reset
afterward, so the next question gets the unmodified defaults.

### 6. User wants to delete or replace content

```
lilbee_list_documents                     # find the source name
lilbee_remove(["old-manual.pdf"])         # drop its chunks (source file kept)
lilbee_remove(["reports/2024"])           # a folder: remove everything indexed beneath it
lilbee_remove(["**/*.log"])               # a glob: remove every matching source
```

For a clean slate: `lilbee_reset(confirm=true)` via the worker.

## Cheat sheet: which knobs to move

| Question style | Tune |
|---|---|
| Code Q&A, call graphs | Set `reranker_model`, raise `rerank_candidates` to 24-48, enable `concept_graph`, lower `chunk_size` to 256-384. |
| Long-document walkthroughs | Raise `top_k` to 12-16 and `max_context_sources`; drop `diversity_max_per_source` to 1 to let one source dominate. |
| Fact lookup across many sources | Raise `top_k` and `candidate_multiplier`; keep `reranker_model` set; keep `diversity_max_per_source` at default. |
| Vocabulary mismatch (English question, code answer) | Enable `hyde`; raise `max_distance` to ~0.8 so semantically-related chunks aren't clipped. |

## Runbook: when things go wrong

- **`total_chunks == 0`.** The library is empty. Don't search. Tell the user and offer
  `lilbee_add` or `lilbee_crawl`.
- **`lilbee_search` returns 0 results.** Try a more specific noun phrase. If still zero,
  the content isn't indexed. Verify with `lilbee_list_documents`.
- **`lilbee_search` times out.** Indexing is in flight. Wait 10s, re-check
  `lilbee_status`, retry. Do not switch tools.
- **`lilbee_settings_set` returns `error`.** The boundary rejected the value (unknown
  key, wrong type, model not installed for a role swap). Show the error to the user
  verbatim; don't paper over it.
- **`lilbee_settings_set` succeeds with `reindex_required: true`.** The persisted vector
  store is no longer valid for the new `chunk_size` / `chunk_overlap`. Run
  `lilbee_sync(force_rebuild=true)` through the worker.
- **`lilbee_model_pull` failed mid-stream.** The progress notifications stop. Retry the
  same call; partially-downloaded files are skipped.
- **Want to set a model role but the catalog ref isn't installed.** Pull first, then
  `settings_set`. The boundary checks the catalog-task assignment but not whether the
  file is present on disk.
- **Confused about what changed in this session.** `lilbee_settings_list` always
  reflects current state.

## Settings you can change, and what a change needs

`lilbee_settings_list` returns the full writable surface at runtime, and
[docs/settings.md](https://github.com/tobocop2/lilbee/blob/main/docs/settings.md) is the
written reference: every setting, its default, and a column per surface saying whether
MCP can set it. Three cases need an extra step after the write succeeds.

**A setting that changes the tool list needs a reconnect.** `wiki`, `memory_enabled` and
`mcp_sessions_enabled` decide which tools register, and that is decided once, when the
server starts. `lilbee_settings_set({"wiki": true})` succeeds and persists, and the
`lilbee_wiki_*` tools still are not there. Tell the user to restart the lilbee MCP server;
do not report the feature as broken. `lilbee_wiki_status` works either way, so read it to
confirm `wiki_enabled` before and after.

**Turning a feature on does not run it.** After enabling the wiki, pages exist only once
you build them: `lilbee_wiki_index`, then `lilbee_wiki_generate(slug)` for a single page,
or `lilbee_wiki_build` for the corpus (roughly one LLM call per source document, so hand
it to the `lilbee-worker` subagent).

**A reindex-forcing setting invalidates the index.** See the `reindex_required` note below.

## Secrets stay out of MCP reads

API keys (`*_api_key` and `hf_token`) carry a `write_only` flag on the lilbee config.
`lilbee_settings_list` skips them; `lilbee_settings_get` errors on them;
`lilbee_settings_set` still writes (so you can configure a key on the user's behalf).
Never assume you can read a key back.

## Citation rules

- Every fact you state must trace to a chunk `lilbee_search` returned. Cite as the
  source file and the line range the chunk reported, exactly as returned (e.g.
  `src/lilbee/data/ingest/pipeline.py:216-247`).
- If a chunk doesn't actually support a claim, drop the claim. Re-search before
  inventing.
- "Not in the indexed files" is a valid answer. Say so plainly and suggest indexing the right
  path if the user expected it to be there.
- When the user reads code in their editor that you've cited, your line numbers must
  match. If you see the chunk metadata report a line range, do not guess a different one.

## What this skill is not

- **Not a code editor.** Use the host's `read` / `edit` / `write` tools after pulling
  context through `lilbee_search`.
- **Not a web search.** `lilbee_crawl` fetches a specific URL into the library on the
  user's explicit request; it isn't a general fallback when search misses.
- **Not a chat model.** lilbee can run its own chat / wiki / OCR models locally, but as
  a tool consumer you stay on the host's model. Don't manipulate `chat_model` unless the
  user is setting lilbee up for their own later TUI use.
- **Not a substitute for codebase discovery tools.** If the host has codesearch / glob /
  grep and the user's question is about a path that isn't indexed yet, offer to index it
  rather than guessing through filesystem tools.

## Other skills

- **Wiki tools** (per-concept and per-entity pages with citations) live in the separate `lilbee-mcp-wiki` skill (`docs/agent-skills/lilbee-mcp-wiki/SKILL.md` in the lilbee repository). Load that only when the user asks about wiki / synthesis pages, or when `lilbee_status` already shows a built wiki.
- **Non-MCP agents** that need to shell out to lilbee's CLI instead of MCP can use the `--json` flag on any command. See the JSON CLI fallback section of the usage guide (`docs/usage.md` in the lilbee repository).
