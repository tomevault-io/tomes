# Code Review Expert

Perform a structured review of the current git changes with focus on SOLID, architecture, removal candidates, and security risks. Default to review-only output unless the user asks to implement changes.

**Reference files**: Use `read_file` to load checklists. The references are in the `references/` subdirectory of this skill. From the skill location (e.g. `.../code-review-expert/SKILL.md`), load `.../code-review-expert/references/solid-checklist.md`, `security-checklist.md`, `code-quality-checklist.md`, `removal-plan.md`.

## Severity Levels

| Level | Name | Description | Action |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| **P0** | Critical | Security vulnerability, data loss risk, correctness bug | Must block merge |
| **P1** | High | Logic error, significant SOLID violation, performance regression | Should fix before merge |
| **P2** | Medium | Code smell, maintainability concern, minor SOLID violation | Fix in this PR or create follow-up |
| **P3** | Low | Style, naming, minor suggestion | Optional improvement |

## Workflow

### 1) Preflight context

- Use `git status -sb`, `git diff --stat`, and `git diff` to scope changes.
- If needed, use `rg` or `grep` to find related modules, usages, and contracts.
- Identify entry points, ownership boundaries, and critical paths (auth, payments, data writes, network).

**Edge cases:**
- **No changes**: If `git diff` is empty, inform user and ask if they want to review staged changes or a specific commit range.
- **Large diff (>500 lines)**: Summarize by file first, then review in batches by module/feature area.
- **Mixed concerns**: Group findings by logical feature, not just file order.

### 2) SOLID + architecture smells

- Load `references/solid-checklist.md` for specific prompts.
- Look for: SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP violations.
- When proposing a refactor, explain *why* it improves cohesion/coupling and outline a minimal, safe split.
- If refactor is non-trivial, propose an incremental plan instead of a large rewrite.

### 3) Removal candidates + iteration plan

- Load `references/removal-plan.md` for template.
- Identify code that is unused, redundant, or feature-flagged off.
- Distinguish **safe delete now** vs **defer with plan**.
- Provide a follow-up plan with concrete steps and checkpoints.

### 4) Security and reliability scan

- Load `references/security-checklist.md` for coverage.
- Check for: XSS, injection, SSRF, path traversal, AuthZ/AuthN gaps, secret leakage, race conditions, etc.
- Call out both **exploitability** and **impact**.

### 5) Code quality scan

- Load `references/code-quality-checklist.md` for coverage.
- Check for: Error handling, performance (N+1, caching), boundary conditions (null, empty, off-by-one).
- Flag issues that may cause silent failures or production incidents.

### 6) Output format

Structure your review as:

```markdown
## Code Review Summary

**Files reviewed**: X files, Y lines changed
**Overall assessment**: [APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES / COMMENT]

---

## Findings

### P0 - Critical
(none or list)

### P1 - High
- **[file:line]** Brief title
 - Description of issue
 - Suggested fix

### P2 - Medium
...

### P3 - Low
...

---

## Removal/Iteration Plan
(if applicable)

## Additional Suggestions
(optional)
```

**Clean review**: If no issues found, explicitly state what was checked and any residual risks.

### 7) Next steps confirmation

After presenting findings, ask user how to proceed. **Do NOT implement any changes until user explicitly confirms.** This is a review-first workflow.
