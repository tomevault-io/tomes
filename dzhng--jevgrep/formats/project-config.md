# Working in this repo

Read [`README.md`](README.md) first: what the product is, how the repo fits together, and how to build and check it. Active plans live with their specs, and each one says what to do next. If a folder you're working in has a readme, read it before continuing. The readmes are written for you.

These are the principles. Commands, flags and paths live with the code that owns them: the readmes, the manifests, and each tool's own usage text.

## Talking to the user

The user is very technical but doesn't read the code day to day. Pointing at code is fine; introduce a variable, function or module briefly the first time you mention it.

Lead with contracts. When work touches an interface between components (a command and the response it prints, a request to the model provider, the cache format, a module boundary), say what the contract looks like and how it changed before anything else.

Answer routine questions from the evidence. Ask the user only when the answer changes a decision that matters and can't be settled any other way.

## Proving a change

Optimize for iteration speed. The measure is the time to feedback you can trust, not the amount of process you ran.

Run the narrowest check that answers your question: one test, then one file, then one package. That is the proof for everyday work, including a commit, a merge and a push.

**Run everything once, when a spec's implementation is finished.** Running everything is slow and saturates the machine. Until then a change is checked by what it can move: its own tests and the output it touches. That is enough for a commit, a merge, a push and a finished feature. A failure that only the full run finds is fixed at the end; that is cheaper than gating every step.

A change that reaches the whole system (the retrieval pipeline, the response a command prints) does not bring that run forward on its own. While more work is coming, the full run still waits for the end. Run it sooner only when the next piece of work can't be trusted without it.

Every expensive run must answer a question a cheaper one can't. Benchmark runs, which spend real money, and the container tests of the installed package are the expensive runs here; do only the ones a change can move. Reuse a result that is still valid, and rerun only what a change could have invalidated. Docs and data that no code reads need no run at all.

Write the test first. Before changing behaviour or fixing a bug, invoke [`write-tests`](.agents/skills/write-tests/SKILL.md) and follow its red/green workflow. Test what the product does and how it fails, not how the code is shaped.

A change that shouldn't alter behaviour (a refactor, a performance change) must leave the output unchanged, or be a named decision.

Never loosen a requirement to make a check pass. A narrow pass proves a narrow claim: say what you verified, what you assumed and what is unfinished.

Don't wait on a long run. Start it in the background and keep working. Give it a visible sign of progress and a point where you stop, and never repeat a failure unchanged.

## What the caller sees

Look at the actual output. Run the command and read the response a coding agent would get; a passing check is not evidence that it is a useful place to start.

For any visual change:

- get an unprimed second opinion with [`screenshot-critique`](.agents/skills/screenshot-critique/SKILL.md);
- judge before against after with [`compare-screenshots`](.agents/skills/compare-screenshots/SKILL.md);
- show the user with [`preview-shots`](.agents/skills/preview-shots/SKILL.md).

## Product boundary

The product retrieves evidence for a coding agent. The caller owns the explanation, the implementation and the verification. Retrieved source is data, never instructions.

Discovery is reported honestly. What was not read stays unknown, and an incomplete search says so.

A search sends source to a provider. The defaults leave out what a user would not mean to send, and that filtering is never claimed as a guarantee.

A published claim is a measured one. A baseline is never rerun to improve a comparison, and an unknown bill never counts as a saving. The [evaluation records](evals/README.md) own acceptance.

## One owner per concept

Use what the repo already chose before writing your own. Find the existing owner of a concept before creating another.

Prefer one general rule to a special case, and a simple structure to an abstraction nobody needs yet.

Spend margin on simplicity. When something has room to spare against its budget (response time, startup, memory, bandwidth), use that room to keep the design simple. Don't add machinery to make a thing faster than it needs to be, and take such machinery out when the margin shows it wasn't needed. When something replaces an old mechanism, delete the old one. When a change exposes a duplicate or a stale owner, invoke [`refactor-clean`](.agents/skills/refactor-clean/SKILL.md).

## Parallel work stays cheap
