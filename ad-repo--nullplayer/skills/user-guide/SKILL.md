# NullPlayer User Guide

A faithful recreation of Winamp 2.x for macOS with Plex/Jellyfin/Subsonic integration, ProjectM visualizations, and casting support.

## System Requirements

- **macOS 14.0 (Sonoma)** or later
- Internet connection (for streaming and skin downloads)

## Core Features

### Windows

| Window | Description | Toggle |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Main Window** | Primary player with transport controls | Always visible |
| **Playlist Editor** | Track list and playlist management | PL button or context menu |
| **Equalizer** | Classic 10-band EQ or modern 21-band EQ with presets | EQ button or context menu |
| **Spectrum Analyzer** | Large spectrum visualization | Context menu or Window menu |
| **Library Browser** | Browse Plex/Jellyfin/Subsonic/Emby and local media | Logo button or context menu |
| **ProjectM** | Real-time audio visualizations | Menu button or context menu |

In modern UI, **Windows > Play History** opens the **Data** tab inside the Library Browser instead of a separate window.

### Top Menu Bar

Global controls are also available from the macOS top menu bar:

- `Windows`
- `UI`
- `Playback`
- `Visuals`
- `Libraries`
- `Output`

`Output > Sonos` supports persistent-open room checkbox selection (same behavior as the context menu Sonos submenu).

### Window Docking

Windows automatically snap together when dragged near each other:
- Edge-to-edge snapping
- Screen edge snapping
- Group minimize (attached windows minimize together)
- **Lock Connected Windows / Unlock Connected Windows** toggle (context menu) controls whether connected windows always move as a group
- **Snap to Default** (context menu) resets all windows

**Drag behaviour:**
- **Quick drag** (release mouse within ~400 ms of clicking): the dragged window detaches from its group and moves alone; other connected windows stay put
- **Hold then drag** (hold ≥ 400 ms before moving): all connected windows move together as a group
- **When connected windows are locked**: hold timing is bypassed and drags always move the whole connected group
- Connected peers show a brief highlight overlay at mouseDown to preview which windows will move together

### Main Window Elements

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Time Display** | Elapsed/remaining time (click to toggle) |
| **Track Marquee** | Scrolling song title/artist |
| **Bitrate** | Track bitrate in kbps |
| **Sample Rate** | Audio sample rate in kHz |
| **Stereo Indicator** | Shows mono/stereo status |
| **Cast Indicator** | Shows when casting to external device |
| **Spectrum Analyzer** | Real-time frequency visualization |

### Sliders

- **Position Bar**: Seek through track
- **Volume Slider**: Adjust playback volume (0-100%)
- **Balance Slider**: Pan audio left/right

### Transport Buttons

Previous, Play, Pause, Stop, Next, Eject (open file dialog)

### Toggle Buttons

- **Shuffle**: Random playback order
- **Repeat**: Loop playlist
- **EQ**: Show/hide Equalizer
- **PL**: Show/hide Playlist

Modern UI adds: **HT** (Hide Title Bars), **CA** (Cast), **pM** (ProjectM), **SP** (Spectrum), **WV** (Waveform), **LB** (Library)

## Media Sources

### Plex Integration
- Browse music, movies, and TV shows
- Album artwork and metadata
- Radio features (Track/Artist/Album/Genre/Decade/Rating/Hits/Deep Cuts)
- Automatic scrobbling (90% or end, min 30s)
- Video playback with casting

### Jellyfin Integration
- Browse music and video libraries
- **Library selector** in status bar: click "Lib:" to switch library. Mode-aware — shows music library picker in music tabs (Artists/Albums/Tracks/Plists) and video library picker in Movies/Shows tabs. "All" option browses across all libraries.
- Rating scale: 0-100% (0-10 internal)
- Scrobbling (50% or 4 minutes for audio, 90% for video)

### Navidrome/Subsonic
- Browse artists, albums, playlists
- **Music folder selector** in status bar: click "Lib:" to filter by music folder. "All" shows content from all folders.
- Token authentication
- Scrobbling (50% or 4 minutes)
- Casting support via proxy

### Emby Integration
- Browse music and video libraries
- **Library selector** in status bar: click "Lib:" to switch library. "All" browses across all libraries.
- Rating scale: 0-100% (0-10 internal, multiply/divide by 10; 1 star = 20)
- Scrobbling (50% or 4 minutes for audio, 90% for video)
- Casting support via proxy (stream URLs have no file extension)

### Internet Radio
- Shoutcast/Icecast streaming
- Live song metadata (ICY + SomaFM fallback when ICY is missing)
- Auto-reconnect on disconnect
- Large bundled global station catalog (including full SomaFM channel set)
- Curated regional additions (African, Caribbean, South American, European, Indian, Thai) plus expanded jazz streams
- Station management (add/edit/delete/import)
- Internet-radio-only folder organization (smart folders + custom folders)
- 5-star station ratings (persisted per station URL)
- Casting to Sonos
- Playback Options now groups all source histories under a single **Radio History** submenu

### Local Files
Drag & drop or use File menu. Supports: MP3, M4A, AAC, WAV, AIFF, FLAC, OGG, ALAC

### Local Library Browser
Switch the Library Browser source to "Local" to manage a persistent media library.

**+ADD menu** (three options):
- **Add Files...** — file picker filtered to audio formats
- **Add Video Files...** — file picker filtered to video formats (`.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.mov`, etc.); files are classified as movies or TV episodes automatically (SxxExx naming / iTunes metadata)
- **Add Folder...** — folder picker; scans immediately for audio and video files, and saves the folder as a "remembered folder"

**Watch folders (remembered folders):**
- Folders added via "Add Folder..." are persisted in the library database
- They are **not** monitored automatically — there is no filesystem watcher
- Press the **⟳ refresh button** to run an **incremental** re-scan of all remembered folders (new/changed/removed files only)
- Fast ingest behavior: newly discovered files appear quickly with filename/basic info, then metadata (duration/tags/sample rate) fills in asynchronously
- Duplicate detection and per-file signatures prevent unnecessary metadata re-parse for unchanged files
- Progress updates are throttled/coarse during large imports to keep UI responsive

**Tabs:** Artists, Albums, Playlists (`Plists` in the UI), Movies, Shows, Search, Radio, Data

### Drag/Drop + Folder Import Behavior (Local/NAS)

Import discovery is now unified across classic + modern entry points (main window, playlist windows, library browsers):

- Directory traversal runs in background (no synchronous recursive UI-thread scans)
- Extension filtering is consistent across add-folder and drag/drop paths
- Supported content checks are shared before accepting a drop
- Works for large local sets and NAS paths (SMB/AFP) with less UI churn during import

## Output Devices & Casting

### Sonos
- Multi-room casting
- Group management while casting
- Local file streaming via embedded server
- Network stream proxying for Subsonic/Jellyfin

- **Modern UI**: integrated glowing `PRE` control in the graph strip replaces the old preamp slider; drag to adjust preamp, double-click to reset to `0 dB`
- **Modern UI**: double-click a fader to reset that band only to `0 dB`
- **Modern UI**: AUTO button applies genre-based preset for the current track and auto-enables EQ if off
- **Modern UI**: all 21 frequency labels are visible in-window, using compact labels like `1K`, `1.4K`, `2K`, `11.2K`

- Bundled skins: Silver (default), Classic, Dark, Light

### Modern UI Mode
- **Options > Use Modern UI** to enable modern skin engine

- **HT On**: All 6 windows (main, EQ, playlist, spectrum, ProjectM, library browser) hide titlebars; the main window keeps the same outer size while its internal layout expands to fill the reclaimed space
