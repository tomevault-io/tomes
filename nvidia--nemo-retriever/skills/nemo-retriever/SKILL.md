name: nemo-retriever
description: Use when the user wants to search, query, extract, transcribe, describe, quote, filter, or aggregate across documents — PDFs, scanned forms / images (`.jpg` `.png` `.tiff`), Office (`.docx` `.pptx`), text (`.html` `.txt`), audio (`.mp3` `.wav` `.m4a`), or video (`.mp4` `.mov`). Prefer this over native Read / Grep for multi-file or non-PDF corpora. Not for: editing files, web browsing, single-file plain-text lookups, fine-tuning.

# nemo-retriever

The `retriever` CLI indexes a folder of PDFs into LanceDB (`retriever ingest`) and serves vector search over it (`retriever query`). For any task about searching/answering questions across a folder of PDFs, use this CLI — do not write a custom RAG.

**Beyond PDFs and beyond semantic search.** `retriever ingest` also handles images, Office, HTML, TXT, audio, and video — see `references/setup.md` for the per-format recipe and `references/install.md` for the install extras (`[multimedia]`, libreoffice, ffmpeg). The query turn is a single command — see **§Query turn** below (inline, no reference read needed); `references/cli/query.md` holds only the fallback detail (exact-term, chart text-extract, compose-reply). Don't fall back to native Read/Grep/Python on non-PDF inputs.

## Install (if `retriever` is missing)

If `command -v retriever` returns nothing, follow `references/install.md` to install the NeMo Retriever Library before proceeding. It prints `RETRIEVER_VENV=<path>`; substitute that path for `<RETRIEVER_VENV>` in every example in this skill (setup, query, troubleshooting, and the CLI references).

## Workflow — read the reference for the current phase, then execute

| Turn type | Read this once | Then execute |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Setup turn** (first turn — `./lancedb/nemo-retriever.lance` doesn't exist) | `references/setup.md` | Build the index |
| **Query turn** (every subsequent turn — user asks a question) | **§Query turn** below (command inline — no reference read needed) | Run it, then `Write` `./output.json` *(eval-harness contract only — for general use, just answer in chat)* |
| Anything errored or returned empty | `references/troubleshooting.md` | Apply the named recovery; do not improvise |

## Query turn — run this, then write the answer

`<RETRIEVER_VENV>/bin/retriever query "<question>" --format evidence --hybrid --top-k 10` → JSON
`{ evidence: [ { text, source, locator, modality, fidelity, score, citation } ], coverage: {...} }`.
That's the FIRST (usually only) call — don't `ls`/`find`/`sed`/Read to orient first; it already searched the whole corpus. Then:
- **Lead with the direct answer** (the exact figure, or Yes/No) for the exact entity asked; address every entity / year / category the question names — even "not provided".
- **Trust by fidelity** (`verbatim > ocr > transcribed > vlm_caption`): a number or directional claim resting ONLY on a `vlm_caption` (chart/image) is unconfirmed — quote it tagged "(chart-derived, unconfirmed)" unless a higher-fidelity item states the same fact. Never fabricate from adjacent text.
- Re-`query` only if the answer isn't yet supported — once per genuinely distinct sub-question (per entity when comparing/listing), or with the exact term when `coverage.thin_spots` flags a miss.
- Open `references/cli/query.md` ONLY for the fallback path (exact-term re-query, chart text-extract, compose-reply detail) — a normal answer needs none of it.

For the full `retriever ingest` CLI spec, see `references/cli/ingest.md`. For `retriever query` flags, `<RETRIEVER_VENV>/bin/retriever query --help` is authoritative (and faster) — you do not need it for routine turns.

Before ingesting a mixed folder, inventory extensions (`find <dir> -name '*.*' | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort -u`) — `--input-type=auto` silently drops anything outside the supported set. See `references/troubleshooting.md` "Unsupported file types".

## Hard limits (apply to every turn)

- **Setup turn**: build the index in one shell command (see `references/setup.md`). STOP after the index lands.
- **Query turn**: at most **2 Bash calls** — 1 `retriever query`, +1 optional targeted text-extract per `references/cli/query.md`. Reply and then STOP.
- **No narration between tool calls.** Tokens you emit between calls become input + cached input for every later turn — quadratic cost. Go straight from reading the summary to writing the JSON file.
- **Banned**: `TodoWrite`, Glob, Grep, `Read` of whole PDFs, re-running setup, spawning subagents, speculative "confirmation" calls.

Long query turns (5+ tool calls, 1M+ cache-read tokens) cost ~5× a disciplined turn and almost always still produce the wrong answer. **Answering partially beats timing out.**
