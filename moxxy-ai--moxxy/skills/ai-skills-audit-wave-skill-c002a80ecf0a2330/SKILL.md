# Audit wave

The pattern that produced A1–A47 (all fixed across PRs #126–#133). Worked
example + method: `.claude/audits/main-audit-2026-06-09.md`.

## Audit pass
1. Pin a base sha; audit THAT, not a moving main.
2. Fan out parallel area auditors (one per subsystem: core, sdk, each plugin
   cluster, desktop, runner, CI/release…). **Every auditor reads TECH_DEBT.md
   first** — "finding" means NOT already journaled.
3. **Adversarial verification:** every critical/high finding goes to an
   independent verifier explicitly instructed to REFUTE it (read the code,
   prove it can't happen). Expect a real refute rate (~5/19 in the 06-09
   audit) — unverified findings waste fix waves.
4. Write the report to `.claude/audits/<name>.md`: confirmed findings with
   file:line + blast radius + fix sketch; refuted findings WITH the refutation
   (so the next audit doesn't re-raise them); medium/low backlog.
5. Intake confirmed items into TECH_DEBT.md as A-numbered entries
   (tech-debt-journal skill).

## Fix waves
- Group confirmed findings into coherent waves (~4-8 items: by subsystem or
  theme), one worktree + branch + PR per wave (`git worktree add` under
  `.claude/worktrees/`).
- Within a wave, parallel fix agents are fine but serialize edits to shared
  files (TECH_DEBT.md last, once, by the integrator).
- Each fix: code + a pinning test + the TECH_DEBT entry flipped to
  "✅ FIXED (this PR)" with the mechanism described.
- Full gate per wave (run-the-gate skill) + changeset → PR → **merge on
  green before cutting the next wave's worktree** (waves often touch
  neighboring lines; stacking unmerged waves breeds conflicts).
- Release blockers (an A1-class regression) jump the queue as their own
  minimal PR.
