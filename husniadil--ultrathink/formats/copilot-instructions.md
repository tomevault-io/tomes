# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**UltraThink** is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server built with FastMCP framework. The project provides tools that can be consumed by MCP clients.

## Development Commands

### Setup & Dependencies

```bash
# Install dependencies (managed by uv)
uv sync
```

### Task Commands (npm-like)

```bash
# List all tasks
uv run task --list

# Run server
uv run task run

# Run tests with coverage
uv run task test

# Quick tests (no coverage)
uv run task test-quick

# Run test client
uv run task client

# Format code (ruff + prettier)
uv run task format

# Lint code
uv run task lint

# Type check with mypy
uv run task typecheck

# Clean cache
uv run task clean
```

### Direct Commands (Alternative)

**Prefer using `uv run task` commands above.** For direct execution:

```bash
# Run the server directly
uv run ultrathink

# Run the test client directly (connects to server via in-memory transport)
uv run task client
# Or: uv run python examples/client.py
```

This will test all available tools by connecting to the MCP server and calling each tool with sample inputs.

```

### Core Structure

- **src/ultrathink/interface/mcp_server.py**: MCP server entry point using FastMCP
  - Define MCP server instance with `FastMCP(name)`
  - Register tools using `@mcp.tool` decorator
  - Imports from services layer

- **src/ultrathink/\_\_main\_\_.py**: CLI entry point
  - Imports `mcp` from `.interface.mcp_server`
  - Defines `main()` function that calls `mcp.run()`
  - Enables `uv run ultrathink` command

- **examples/client.py**: Test harness for the MCP server
  - Uses `Client` from FastMCP for in-memory testing
  - Connects to server via `async with Client(mcp)`
  - Lists and calls tools to verify functionality

### Adding New Tools

Tools are added in `src/ultrathink/interface/mcp_server.py` by decorating functions with `@mcp.tool`:

```python
from ..services.thinking_service import UltraThinkService

@mcp.tool
def tool_name(param: type) -> return_type:
    """Tool description shown to MCP clients"""
    return result
```

The FastMCP framework automatically:

- Converts function signatures to MCP tool schemas
- Handles parameter validation
- Manages STDIO transport for external clients

### Testing Pattern

All tools should be tested:

1. Unit tests organized by layers (mirroring source structure):
   - `tests/models/test_thought.py` - Thought model properties and formatting
   - `tests/models/test_session.py` - Session logging and formatted output
   - `tests/services/test_thinking_service.py` - Service validation, functionality, branching, multi-session
   - `tests/interface/test_mcp_server.py` - MCP tool function tests
   - `tests/test_cli.py` - CLI entry point tests
2. Integration tests via `examples/client.py`:
   - Connect to server using in-memory transport
   - List available tools
   - Call each tool with sample inputs
   - Verify expected outputs

### Imports

When working with the codebase:

```python
# From external code
from ultrathink import mcp, UltraThinkService, Thought

# Within the package (relative imports)
from ..services.thinking_service import UltraThinkService
from ..models.thought import Thought, ThoughtRequest, ThoughtResponse
from ..models.session import ThinkingSession
```

### Session Management

**Important Design Note:** Sessions are stored in-memory only (`UltraThinkService._sessions: dict[str, ThinkingSession]`). This means:

- **Sessions are ephemeral** - all session data is lost when the server restarts
- **No persistence layer** - sessions exist only in memory during server runtime
- **Production consideration** - if persistent sessions are needed, implement custom session storage (disk, database, Redis, etc.)

This design choice keeps the implementation simple and stateless-friendly, but developers should be aware that session continuity across restarts requires additional implementation.

### Assumption Tracking

The ultrathink tool supports explicit assumption tracking to make reasoning more transparent and adaptive.

#### Key Features

- **Explicit assumptions**: State what you're taking for granted with `Assumption` objects
- **Confidence tracking**: Express confidence in each assumption (0.0-1.0)
- **Criticality marking**: Flag assumptions as critical (if false, reasoning collapses)
- **Dependency tracking**: Link thoughts to the assumptions they depend on
- **Assumption invalidation**: Mark assumptions as false when discovered
- **Risk detection**: Automatically identify risky assumptions (critical + low confidence + unverified)

#### Migration Guide: Before vs After

**Before (Implicit assumptions):**

```python
# Thought 1
"Redis will work because it's fast enough for our use case"

# Thought 2
"Based on Redis performance, we can handle 10K requests/sec"
```

**After (Explicit assumption tracking):**

```python
# Thought 1: State assumptions explicitly
thought = "Redis should meet our performance requirements"
assumptions = [
    Assumption(
        id="A1",
        text="Network latency to Redis < 5ms",
        confidence=0.8,
        critical=True,
        verifiable=True
    ),
    Assumption(
        id="A2",
        text="Cache hit rate will be > 70%",
        confidence=0.6,
        critical=True,
        verifiable=True
    )
]

# Thought 2: Build on previous assumptions
thought = "Based on low latency (A1) and high hit rate (A2), Redis can handle 10K req/sec"
depends_on_assumptions = ["A1", "A2"]

# Thought 3: Invalidate if proven false
thought = "After testing, cache hit rate is only 45%, not 70%!"
invalidates_assumptions = ["A2"]  # Marks A2 as verified_false

# Thought 4: Revise reasoning
thought = "Need to implement cache warming to improve hit rate"
is_revision = True
revises_thought = 2
assumptions = [
    Assumption(
        id="A3",
        text="Cache warming can increase hit rate to > 70%",
        confidence=0.7,
        critical=True,
        evidence="Based on similar systems in production"
    )
]
```

#### Benefits

1. **Makes reasoning auditable**: See exactly what was assumed at each step
2. **Enables adaptive reasoning**: When assumptions prove false, reasoning can adapt
3. **Supports hypothesis testing**: Explicitly state and verify assumptions
4. **Improves transparency**: Clear what's certain vs uncertain in reasoning

#### Confidence and Uncertainty Tracking

Each thought can include confidence levels, uncertainty notes, and outcomes to make reasoning more transparent.

**Available Fields:**

- **`confidence`** (float, 0.0-1.0): Express your confidence level in this thought
  - Low (0.3-0.6): Exploratory thinking, initial hypotheses, uncertain analysis
  - Medium (0.6-0.8): Reasoned analysis, likely conclusions, working hypotheses
  - High (0.8-1.0): Verified solutions, confident conclusions, proven facts

- **`uncertainty_notes`** (str, optional): Explain what you're uncertain about or what concerns you have
  - Use this to explicitly state doubts, risks, or things that need verification
  - Helps track what needs more investigation

- **`outcome`** (str, optional): Describe what was achieved or expected from this thought
  - Documents the result of the reasoning step
  - Useful for tracking decisions and their justifications

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Thought 1: Uncertain exploration
ThoughtRequest(
    thought="We could use Redis for caching, but need to verify performance",
    total_thoughts=5,
    confidence=0.6,
    uncertainty_notes="Haven't tested with production-scale load yet"
)

# Thought 2: Investigating uncertainty
ThoughtRequest(
    thought="Ran load tests - Redis handles 50K req/sec with p99 < 10ms",
    total_thoughts=5,
    confidence=0.9,
    outcome="Confirmed Redis meets performance requirements"
)

# Thought 3: Final decision
ThoughtRequest(
    thought="Proceeding with Redis implementation",
    total_thoughts=5,
    confidence=0.95,
    outcome="Decision made to use Redis based on successful load tests"
)
```

**Display Format:**

When thoughts are logged, these fields appear with visual indicators:
- Confidence: Shows as percentage in header `[Confidence: 90%]`
- Uncertainty: Prefixed with `⚠️  Uncertainty:` (shown prominently)
- Outcome: Prefixed with `✓ Outcome:` (shown at end of thought)

#### Assumption ID Format

- **Local format**: `^A\d+$` (e.g., "A1", "A2", "A10")
- **Cross-session format**: `^[\w-]+:A\d+$` (e.g., "session-1:A1", "uuid-123:A2")
- Case-sensitive: "a1" is invalid, must be "A1"
- Sequential numbering recommended but not enforced

#### Cross-Session Assumption References

**Feature**: Reference assumptions from previous thinking sessions

**Use Case**: When reasoning across multiple sessions, you can now reference assumptions made in earlier sessions without raising errors.

**Format**:
- Local reference: `"A1"` (same session)
- Cross-session reference: `"session-id:A1"` (from another session)

**Behavior**:
- **Local references** are strictly validated (must exist in current session)
- **Cross-session references** use graceful handling:
  - If session or assumption not found → added to `unresolved_references`
  - Warning logged (if logging enabled)
  - Execution continues normally

**Response Fields**:
- `unresolved_references: list[str]` - IDs of cross-session assumptions that couldn't be resolved
- `cross_session_warnings: list[str]` - Warning messages from cross-session operations

**Example**:

```python
# Session 1: Create assumption
ThoughtRequest(
    thought="Redis will work",
    session_id="session-1",
    assumptions=[Assumption(id="A1", text="Redis latency < 5ms")]
)

# Session 2: Reference assumption from session 1
ThoughtRequest(
    thought="Building on previous session's assumption",
    session_id="session-2",
    depends_on_assumptions=["session-1:A1"]
)
# → If session-1:A1 exists: tracks dependency
# → If not found: adds to unresolved_references, continues execution
```

**Limitations**:
- **Cross-session invalidation not supported**: Attempting to invalidate `session-x:A1` produces warning
- **No assumption copying**: Cross-session refs track dependencies only, don't copy assumptions
- **Session must exist at runtime**: References are resolved against in-memory sessions only

## Dependencies

- **fastmcp**: Framework for building MCP servers with minimal boilerplate
- **rich**: Library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal (colored output, formatted boxes)
- **mypy**: Type checker configured in strict mode for entire codebase
- Python 3.12+ required (specified in pyproject.toml)

## Code Quality

- **Type Safety**: All code (src, tests, examples) is fully type-checked with mypy in strict mode
- **Coverage**: 100% test coverage maintained across all code
- **Formatting**: Automated with ruff and prettier
- **Linting**: Enforced with ruff

Always run `uv run task typecheck` before committing to ensure type safety.
