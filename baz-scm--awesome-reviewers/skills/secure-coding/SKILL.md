# Secure Coding Practices

In the age of constant cyber threats, security is everyone’s job. Developers are on the front lines of safeguarding applications, from locking down APIs to securing cloud deployments. This skill means anticipating how code could be exploited and coding defensively. With a majority of organizations attributing breaches to lack of cyber skills, there’s high demand for developers who can build secure systems from the ground up.

## Examples
- Validating all inputs and encoding outputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
- Using secure libraries and protocols (HTTPS, OAuth) and storing sensitive data (passwords, API keys) in encrypted form or secret managers.

## Guidelines
- **Follow Security Best Practices:** Adhere to well-known secure coding standards like the OWASP Top 10. Validate inputs, use proper authentication and error handling, and keep dependencies up to date to patch known vulnerabilities. These habits prevent common exploits.
- **DevSecOps Mindset:** Integrate security checks into development. Perform code reviews and use automated tools (scanners, dependency checks) to catch flaws early. For example, run static analysis to detect insecure code patterns before they reach production.
- **Cloud & API Security:** Be aware of security for the platforms you use. Protect cloud infrastructure with appropriate configurations and services and secure your APIs with authentication, authorization, and rate-limiting. Understanding cloud security is now essential for developers, not just dedicated security teams.
