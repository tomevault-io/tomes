# Akka Streams and Pekko Streams (Scala)

## Quick start
- **Think twice before using Streams**: prefer plain functions, even for I/O.
- Test stream components using `TestSource`, `TestSink`, and `TestProbe` from `akka-stream-testkit`.
- Always define supervision strategies for error handling; default behavior tears down the entire stream.
- Read `references/akka-streams.md` for core concepts and patterns.
- Read `references/best-practices.md` for critical guidance on when NOT to use streams.
- Read `references/testing.md` for comprehensive testing examples.

## When NOT to use Streams
- Don't model plain data transformations as stream operators; use regular functions instead.
- Don't use streams for general I/O; prefer plain functions or other abstractions.

## Workflow
1. Verify that Streams are the right tool: do you need dataflow or reactive programming patterns?
2. Design `Source`, `Flow`, and `Sink` components as separate, testable units.
3. Define error handling with `recover`, `recoverWithRetries`, or supervision strategies.
4. Test each component with `TestSource`/`TestSink` or `TestProbe` before integration.
5. Compose the final graph and materialize with explicit error handling.

## Testing rules
- Write tests using `akka-stream-testkit` for custom stream components.
- Use `TestSource.probe` and `TestSink.probe` for fine-grained control over element flow.
- Test backpressure behavior explicitly using `request()` and `expectNoMessage()`.
- Test error scenarios with `expectError()` or supervision strategies.

## Pekko Streams
- Pekko Streams is a fork of Akka Streams with identical APIs (package names change from `akka.*` to `org.apache.pekko.*`).
- All guidance for Akka Streams applies equally to Pekko Streams.
- When working with Pekko, adjust imports but keep patterns and testing approaches identical.

## Output expectations
- Keep stream topologies simple and testable; break complex graphs into named components.
- Make error handling explicit via supervision or recovery operators.
- Prefer immutability; stream graphs are blueprints until materialized.

## References
- Load `references/akka-streams.md` for core concepts, operators, and materialization.
- Load `references/best-practices.md` for critical guidance on avoiding stream overuse.
- Load `references/testing.md` for testing patterns and complete examples.
