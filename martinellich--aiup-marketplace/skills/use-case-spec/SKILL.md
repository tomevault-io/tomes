# Use Case Specification

## Instructions

Create or update use case specification documents for $ARGUMENTS in `docs/use_cases/`. Each use case describes a complete interaction between an actor and the system to achieve a goal.

## DO NOT

- Write vague or incomplete scenarios
- Skip numbering steps in the Main Success Scenario
- Omit alternative flows for error conditions
- Leave postconditions undefined
- Mix multiple use cases in one document
- Use technical implementation details in the flow steps

## Template

Use [templates/use-case.md](templates/use-case.md) as the document structure.

## Example Use Case

## Workflow

1. Read the requirements document and use case diagram
2. Identify the use case to document
3. Use TodoWrite to track progress
4. Write the Overview section with actor and goal
5. Define preconditions (what must be true before starting)
6. Write the Main Success Scenario step by step
7. Identify alternative flows:
    - Error conditions
