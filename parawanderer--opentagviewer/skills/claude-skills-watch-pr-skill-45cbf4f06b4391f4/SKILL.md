# Watching a PR through to a verdict

A pushed PR is not finished work. It is work awaiting a verdict that `gh` can read — so read it,
and say what happened. Offer this every time a PR is pushed, unless told otherwise.

**Arm a `Monitor`. Do not poll in a loop, and do not go idle waiting.** The notification arrives
on its own; keep working on the next thing in the meantime.

## The trap this skill exists for

A monitor that emits nothing looks exactly like a monitor watching something that has not
happened yet. **Silence is not success.** One was armed on PR #97 here, produced nothing for its
whole lifetime, and exited 0 — and the PR's status was found by hand, while the monitor was still
believed to be running.

So: **run the poll body once in the foreground first, and see it print.** One `Bash` call. If it
prints nothing there, it will print nothing for the next half hour either.

```bash
# Prove it emits BEFORE arming anything.
PR=99
gh pr view "$PR" --json statusCheckRollup --jq \
  '.statusCheckRollup[] | select(.status == "COMPLETED") | "\(.name): \(.conclusion)"'
```

## First check whether this PR gets checks at all

An **empty** rollup is not "too early" — it may mean nothing will ever run.

```bash
gh pr view <n> --json statusCheckRollup,baseRefName \
  --jq '{base: .baseRefName, checks: (.statusCheckRollup | length)}'
```

Two independent reasons it comes back zero, and **the second one is invisible in the diff**:

- **Path filters.** Every workflow here is filtered (`app/**`, `scripts/**`, `gradle/**`,
  `pyrightconfig.json`, `.flake8`), so a PR touching only docs, `.gitattributes`, `.claude/`, or
  `.github/` itself produces nothing.
- **A base that is not `main`.** Every workflow is `pull_request: branches: [ "main" ]`, so a
  **stacked PR gets no checks whatsoever**, however much application code it touches. This is
  the one that catches you out: the obvious test — "does the diff touch a filtered path?" —
  says yes, and still nothing runs. Seen on #105, which changed `app/**` heavily and had a
  rollup of zero because it was based on the branch of #104.

Zero either way? **Do not arm a monitor.** Say the change is not covered by CI and why, and let
the human decide — that is more useful than a green tick would have been, because it names what
is *not* being verified. For a stack, the choice is theirs: merge the base so GitHub retargets
the child onto `main`, or retarget it now and accept the parent's commits showing in the diff.

**Whichever they pick, local runs are the only evidence until then.** Say what you ran, in
numbers — `./gradlew :app:testEmulatorDebugAndroidTest` and the pytest suites — rather than
letting "no checks" read as "nothing to check".

## Use `gh pr view`, not `gh pr checks`

`gh pr checks` sets its exit code from the checks themselves, so the usual
`s=$(gh pr checks …) || continue` swallows the real answer and loops silently. `gh pr view
--json statusCheckRollup` exits 0 whatever the checks say, which is what a poll loop needs.

Note the two fields differ: `.status` is the lifecycle (`QUEUED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `COMPLETED`) and
`.conclusion` is the verdict (`SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, `CANCELLED`, `SKIPPED`). A check that has not
finished has an **empty** conclusion, so filter on `.status == "COMPLETED"` and report
`.conclusion`.

## The monitor

Emits one line per check as it lands, then one line when the run is over. Copy it as-is and
change `PR`:

```bash
cd 'c:\Users\shaneb\git\OpenTagViewer'
PR=99
seen=""
while true; do
  now=$(gh pr view "$PR" --json statusCheckRollup --jq \
        '.statusCheckRollup[] | select(.status == "COMPLETED") | "\(.name): \(.conclusion)"' 2>/dev/null | sort)
  comm -13 <(printf '%s\n' "$seen") <(printf '%s\n' "$now")
  seen="$now"
  total=$(gh pr view "$PR" --json statusCheckRollup --jq '.statusCheckRollup | length' 2>/dev/null)
  if [ "$total" = "0" ]; then
    echo "PR #$PR: NO CHECKS EXIST - nothing is verifying this. See the section above."
    break
  fi
  if [ "$(gh pr view "$PR" --json statusCheckRollup --jq \
          '[.statusCheckRollup[].status] | all(. == "COMPLETED")' 2>/dev/null)" = "true" ]; then
    echo "PR #$PR: all $total checks finished"
    break
  fi
  sleep 30
done
```

**The zero case is checked separately, and that is not belt-and-braces.** `[] | all(...)` is
`true` in jq, so without it an empty rollup exits immediately announcing "all checks finished" —
a monitor reporting success over a PR that ran nothing at all. That happened on #105.

`timeout_ms`: the emulator suite here takes several minutes and the whole run rarely exceeds 20,
so 2700000 (45 min) is comfortable. `persistent: false` — it ends itself.

Why it is shaped this way:

- **`comm -13` against the previous set** reports each check once, as it finishes, rather than
  re-reporting the finished ones every 30 seconds.
- **`printf '%s\n'`, not `echo`**, so an empty `seen` is one empty line and `comm` behaves.
- **It reports failures as readily as successes.** A filter matching only `SUCCESS` stays silent
  through a red build, and silence reads as "still running".
- **`2>/dev/null` on the `gh` calls, but no `|| continue`.** A transient API failure yields an
  empty result and the loop tries again; it must not be able to exit quietly.

## When it lands

- **Green** — merge if that was asked for, otherwise say it is green and offer.
  `gh pr merge <n> --merge --delete-branch`. Then `git fetch && git rebase origin/main` on
  anything stacked on it.
- **Red** — read the failing step and fix it. `--log-failed` refuses while a run is still going,
  so get the step list from the API first:

  ```bash
  gh pr checks <n>                                    # which job, and its URL
  gh api repos/parawanderer/OpenTagViewer/actions/jobs/<job-id> \
    --jq '.steps[] | "\(.conclusion // .status)\t\(.name)"'
  gh run view --job <job-id> --log-failed | tail -30   # once the run has finished
  ```

  **Read the failure before assuming it is flaky.** On #99 a red build was not CI noise: it was
  the repo type-checking against PyPI's `FindMy` while the app built a fork, which was a real
  defect the failure exposed.
- **Pushed a fix?** Re-arm. A green run on the previous commit says nothing about this one.
