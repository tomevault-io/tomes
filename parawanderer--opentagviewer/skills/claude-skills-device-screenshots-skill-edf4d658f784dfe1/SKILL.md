description: Render app UI on the Gradle managed device and look at the result without spending a fortune in vision tokens. Use whenever a change is visual - colours, themes, drawables, layout - or when a screenshot needs comparing before and after, light and dark. Use when this capability is needed.

# Looking at the app's UI

Two halves: getting a screenshot off the device, and reading it cheaply. The second is the part
that is easy to get wrong.

## Never Read a raw screenshot

A device screenshot is ~1080px wide and mostly whitespace. Reading one costs a lot of vision
tokens for a picture whose informative part is a few hundred pixels, and reading a before/after
pair separately doubles it for a comparison that wants to be side by side anyway.

Run them through the sheet tool first:

```bash
python .claude/skills/device-screenshots/sheet.py \
    app/build/outputs/managed_device_android_test_additional_output/debug/testEmulator \
    <scratchpad>/shots
```

Then Read the sheets it prints. One subject, all its variants, one image, a few hundred pixels
wide.

Files are grouped on the part before the last hyphen; the part after is the variant label:

```
my_device_list_item-fixed.png       ->  subject my_device_list_item, variant "fixed"
my_device_list_item-wallpaper.png                                    variant "wallpaper"
```

| Flag | Default | For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--width` | 420 | target width per panel |
| `--max-height` | 420 | cap, so a tall image cannot produce a 2000px sheet |
| `--dark` | `dark,wallpaper_dark,night` | variants composited over black rather than white |

Needs Pillow (`python -m pip install pillow`).

## Getting the screenshots

`SystemColorsLayoutTest` is the working example. Inflate a layout — or load a drawable —
against a themed context, draw it to a `Bitmap`, and write it to the directory AGP passes as the
`additionalTestOutputDir` instrumentation argument. AGP copies that back to the host after the
run:

```
app/build/outputs/managed_device_android_test_additional_output/debug/testEmulator/
```

Run it on the managed device, which provisions and tears down its own emulator:

```bash
JAVA_HOME='C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr' ./gradlew :app:testEmulatorDebugAndroidTest
```

No activity is needed for most of this. Inflating the layout against a
`ContextThemeWrapper(context, R.style.Theme_OpenTagViewer)` on the main thread is enough, and it
avoids every problem that comes with launching one.

## Two traps, both hit here already

**Transparency.** Several layouts have no background of their own. Converting them straight to
RGB renders every transparent pixel black, and the result looks like a catastrophic bug that is
not there. The tool composites over a background; do the same anywhere else.

**Images are not assertions.** A screenshot proves what one configuration looked like once.
Whatever the change is, assert it as well — a resolved colour, a contrast ratio, a measured
height. `SystemColorsLayoutTest` requires the timeline tiles to clear WCAG 3:1 against their
background, which is what actually fails the build; the images are what explain why.

And be careful what the assertion is *about*. That same test renders drawables through a themed
context, so it kept passing while the history timeline was invisible in the app — the app was
loading them with a null theme. The test proved the drawable could render, not that the app asked
for it correctly. `ThemedDrawableLoadingTest` covers the call site instead.

## Dark mode

Rendering the day theme only is the usual mistake — the app has a full `values-night` palette. A
themed context can be forced to night without changing the device:

```java
Configuration night = new Configuration(context.getResources().getConfiguration());
night.uiMode = (night.uiMode & ~Configuration.UI_MODE_NIGHT_MASK)
        | Configuration.UI_MODE_NIGHT_YES;
Context darkContext = context.createConfigurationContext(night);
// then wrap in ContextThemeWrapper(darkContext, R.style.Theme_OpenTagViewer)
```

Name those outputs `-dark` so the sheet tool composites them over black.

  evidence; "it should look right" is not.
