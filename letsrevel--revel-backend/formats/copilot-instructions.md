# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

This project uses a comprehensive Makefile for development tasks:

### Primary Development Commands
- `make setup` - Complete one-time setup: creates venv, installs dependencies, sets up Docker services, and starts the server
- `make run` - Start Django development server (generates test JWTs first)
- `make jwt EMAIL=user@example.com` - Get JWT access and refresh tokens for a specific user
- `make check` - Run all code quality checks (format, lint, mypy, migration-check, i18n-check, file-length)
- `make test` - Run pytest test suite in parallel with coverage reporting. On failure, saves the failures section to `.tests.output`
- `make test-linear` - Run pytest test suite sequentially (single process)
- `make test-failed` - Re-run only failed tests

### Code Quality & Formatting
- `make format` - Auto-format code with ruff
- `make lint` - Run linting with ruff (auto-fixes issues)
- `make mypy` - Run strict type checking with mypy
- `make i18n-check` - Verify translation files are compiled and up-to-date

### Internationalization (i18n)
- `make makemessages` - Extract translatable strings and update .po files
- `make compilemessages` - Compile .po files into .mo binaries (commit after running!)
- `make i18n-check` - Verify .mo files are up-to-date with .po files

### Database Management
- `make migrations` - Create new Django migrations
- `make migrate` - Apply pending migrations
- `make bootstrap` - Initialize database with base data
- `make seed` - Populate database with test data
- `make nuke-db` - **DESTRUCTIVE**: Reset database and regenerate migration files (preserves special data migrations)
- `make restart` - **DESTRUCTIVE**: Deletes all migration files, regenerates them, restarts Docker, and bootstraps from scratch

### Background Services
- `make run-celery` - Start Celery worker for background tasks
- `make run-celery-beat` - Start Celery beat scheduler
- `make run-flower` - Start Flower (Celery monitoring UI)

### Testing Variants
- `make test-linear` - Run tests sequentially (single process, useful for debugging)

## Project Architecture

Revel is a Django-based event management platform with the following structure:

### Core Applications
- **accounts/** - User authentication, registration, JWT handling, GDPR compliance
- **events/** - Core event management, organizations, tickets, memberships, invitations
- **questionnaires/** - Dynamic questionnaire system with LLM-powered evaluation
- **notifications/** - Multi-channel notification system (in-app, email, Telegram) with user preferences and digest support
- **wallet/** - Apple Wallet pass generation for event tickets (.pkpass files)
- **geo/** - Geolocation features, city data, IP-based location detection
- **telegram/** - Telegram bot integration with FSM-based conversation flows
- **api/** - Global API configuration, exception handlers, rate limiting
- **common/** - Shared utilities, authentication, base models, admin customizations

### Key Architectural Patterns

#### Service Layer Pattern
Business logic is encapsulated in service modules:
- `events/service/` - Event management, organization services
- `accounts/service/` - User management, authentication services
- `questionnaires/service/` - Questionnaire evaluation logic
- `notifications/service/` - Notification dispatching, eligibility, digests, reminders

#### Controller Pattern (Django Ninja)
API endpoints are organized in controller classes:
- Controllers inherit from `UserAwareController` for common user/auth functionality
- Use `@api_controller` decorator with consistent tagging
- Implement pagination with `PageNumberPaginationExtra`
- Support search with `@searching` decorator

#### Permission System
- Custom permission classes in `events/controllers/permissions.py`
- Organization-based access control with roles (Owner, Staff, Member)
- Event-level permissions with eligibility checking
- JWT-based authentication with optional anonymous access

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Django 5+ with Django Ninja for API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geo features
- **Async Tasks**: Celery with Redis
- **Authentication**: JWT with custom user model
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem in development; configurable for production
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose for development services

### Testing Framework
- **pytest** with Django integration
- Test data generation via ORM and shared fixtures in `conftest.py`
- Coverage reporting with HTML output
- Celery task testing with pytest-celery

### Code Quality Standards
- **Formatting**: ruff (replaces black)
- **Linting**: ruff with Django-specific rules
- **Type Checking**: mypy with strict settings and Django plugin
- **Docstrings**: Google-style format required
- **Coverage**: 90%+ branch coverage required in CI pipeline

### Development Environment
- Python 3.13+ required
- **UV for dependency management** (use `uv add`/`uv remove` - NEVER use pip directly)
- Docker for services (PostgreSQL, Redis, ClamAV)
- Virtual environment automatically created in `.venv/`

### Key Configuration Files
- `pyproject.toml` - Dependencies, tool configuration (ruff, mypy, pytest)
- `Makefile` - Development commands and workflows
- `compose.yaml` - Development services
- `src/revel/settings/` - Modular Django settings

### Security Features
- GDPR compliance with data export/deletion
- File malware scanning with ClamAV
- Advanced user permissions and organization roles
- Questionnaire-based access control
- Secure file handling with quarantine system

## Testing Guidelines

When writing tests:
- Create test data via ORM and shared fixtures from `conftest.py`
- Mock external services (Celery tasks, email, file uploads)
- Test both success and error cases
- Include integration tests for complex workflows
- Maintain high test coverage

## Development Notes

- Run `make check` before committing to ensure code quality
- Use type hints for all function signatures (required by mypy --strict), including in tests and fixtures.
- Follow Google-style docstrings for public APIs
- Controllers should inherit from `UserAwareController` for consistent user handling
- Business logic belongs in service modules, not controllers or models
- **Models must never import from service modules.** Pure utility functions needed by models belong in `<app>/utils/` (e.g., `accounts/utils/email_normalization.py`). The dependency direction is: controllers → services → models/utils. Services and models may both import from utils.
- Use Django Ninja's automatic OpenAPI documentation features
- Use the context7 MCP to look up documentation
- Adhere to DRY, KISS and SOLID principles. Exceptions are allowed when they make sense.
- Do not catch exceptions for the sake of catching them. Especially in the celery tasks, it might be important to let them propagate instead of having the tasks fail silently.
- Avoid using raw dictionaries. When possible prefer TypedDict, Pydantic or Dataclasses

## Dependency Management

**IMPORTANT:** This project uses UV for dependency management. NEVER use pip directly.

### Adding Dependencies
- **Production dependencies:** `uv add <package>`
- **Development dependencies:** `uv add --dev <package>` or `uv add --group dev <package>`
- **Optional dependencies:** `uv add --optional <group> <package>`

### Removing Dependencies
- `uv remove <package>`

### Syncing Environment
- `uv sync` - Install all dependencies from lockfile
- `uv sync --dev` - Include development dependencies

### Why UV?
- Faster than pip
- Deterministic dependency resolution
- Automatic virtual environment management
- Better conflict detection

## Implementation Workflow

When working on issues or new features, follow this collaborative workflow:

### 1. Investigation & Analysis Phase
- Read the issue description thoroughly
- Explore relevant code sections using Read/Grep/Glob tools
- Identify all affected files, models, and components
- Map out dependencies and relationships

### 2. Discussion Phase (Required)
- Present findings to the user
- Propose multiple approaches with pros/cons when applicable
- Discuss implementation details, edge cases, and trade-offs
- Ask clarifying questions about:
  - Desired behavior and user experience
  - Technical preferences (library choices, patterns to follow)
  - Migration strategies and backward compatibility
  - API design decisions
  - Testing requirements
- Create a detailed implementation plan with clear phases
- Get explicit approval before proceeding to implementation

### 3. Implementation Phase
- Use TodoWrite to track progress through implementation phases
- Update todos as each phase completes
- Follow the agreed-upon plan from the discussion phase
- Raise concerns immediately if issues are discovered during implementation

### 4. Key Principles
- **No surprises**: Discuss before implementing, especially for architectural decisions
- **Be thorough**: Consider migration paths, backward compatibility, and data safety
- **Document decisions**: Explain reasoning in comments and docstrings
- **Iterative refinement**: It's better to ask questions than make assumptions

## Code Style Preferences

### Typing Imports
- **Always use**: `import typing as t` (never `from typing import ...`)
- **Access types as**: `t.Any`, `t.TYPE_CHECKING`, `t.cast()`, etc.
- **Rationale**: Consistent namespace, avoids polluting module scope, clear provenance of type constructs
- Example:
  ```python
  # Good
  import typing as t

  def process(data: t.Any) -> dict[str, t.Any]:
      if t.TYPE_CHECKING:
          from mymodule import MyType
      return t.cast(dict[str, t.Any], data)

  # Bad
  from typing import Any, TYPE_CHECKING, cast

  def process(data: Any) -> dict[str, Any]:
      ...
  ```

### Schemas (Django Ninja)
- **ModelSchema**: Only declare fields at class level when they require special handling (e.g., enum conversion to string)
- **Omit unnecessary fields**: Don't include `created_at`/`updated_at` in response schemas unless specifically needed
- **DRY**: Let ModelSchema infer field types from the model definition
- **Enum fields**: Always use the model's enum class directly (e.g., `Model.MyEnum`), never bare `str` or `Literal[...]`. This ensures the OpenAPI spec documents valid values and keeps a single source of truth.
- **Datetime fields**: Always use `pydantic.AwareDatetime` for datetime fields in schemas, never `datetime.datetime`. This ensures timezone-aware serialization in the OpenAPI spec and consistent API contracts.
- Example:
  ```python
  # Good - enum referenced from the model
  class UserSchema(ModelSchema):
      restriction_type: DietaryRestriction.RestrictionType
      class Meta:
          model = User
          fields = ["id", "name", "email"]

  # Good - plain Schema also uses model enum
  class BannerSchema(Schema):
      severity: SiteSettings.BannerSeverity

  # Good - AwareDatetime for timezone-aware fields
  from pydantic import AwareDatetime
  class EventSchema(Schema):
      starts_at: AwareDatetime
      ends_at: AwareDatetime | None = None

  # Bad - datetime.datetime loses timezone enforcement
  class EventSchema(Schema):
      starts_at: datetime.datetime

  # Bad - bare str loses enum contract
  class BannerSchema(Schema):
      severity: str

  # Bad - Literal duplicates the enum values
  class BannerSchema(Schema):
      severity: Literal["info", "warning", "error"]

  # Bad - redundant declarations
  class UserSchema(ModelSchema):
      id: UUID4
      name: str
      email: str
      created_at: datetime.datetime  # Not needed for API responses
      class Meta:
          model = User
          fields = ["id", "name", "email", "created_at"]
  ```

### Controllers (Django Ninja Extra)
- **Authentication & throttling**: Define at class level when all endpoints share the same configuration
- **Per-endpoint overrides**: Use `throttle=WriteThrottle()` only for POST/PATCH/DELETE that modify data
- **Default throttle**: `UserDefaultThrottle` for GET endpoints, `WriteThrottle` for mutations
- **Flat functions**: Avoid nested conditionals. Use early returns and `model_dump(exclude_unset=True)` for updates
- **No try-except in views**: Use `get_object_or_404()` or `self.get_object_or_exception()` for lookups
- Example:
  ```python
  # Good
  @api_controller("/api", auth=I18nJWTAuth(), throttle=UserDefaultThrottle())
  class MyController(ControllerBase):
      @route.post("/items", throttle=WriteThrottle())
      def create_item(self, payload: Schema) -> Item:
          return Item.objects.create(**payload.model_dump())

      @route.patch("/items/{id}", throttle=WriteThrottle())
      def update_item(self, id: UUID, payload: UpdateSchema) -> Item:
          item = get_object_or_404(Item, id=id, user=self.user())
          update_data = payload.model_dump(exclude_unset=True)
          if not update_data:
              return item
          for field, value in update_data.items():
              setattr(item, field, value)
          item.save(update_fields=list(update_data.keys()))
          return item

  # Bad - repetitive auth/throttle, nested ifs
  @api_controller("/api", throttle=AuthThrottle())
  class MyController(ControllerBase):
      @route.post("/items", auth=I18nJWTAuth(), throttle=WriteThrottle())
      def create_item(self, payload: Schema) -> Item:
          return Item.objects.create(**payload.model_dump())

      @route.patch("/items/{id}", auth=I18nJWTAuth(), throttle=WriteThrottle())
      def update_item(self, id: UUID, payload: UpdateSchema) -> Item:
          try:
              item = Item.objects.get(id=id, user=self.user())
          except Item.DoesNotExist:
              raise Http404

          if payload.field1 is not None:
              item.field1 = payload.field1
          if payload.field2 is not None:
              item.field2 = payload.field2
          item.save()
          return item
  ```

### Race Condition Protection
- **Use helper function**: For create operations with uniqueness constraints, use `get_or_create_with_race_protection()` from `common.utils`
- **No manual try-except**: Avoid wrapping IntegrityError manually in views
- Example:
  ```python
  # Good
  from common.utils import get_or_create_with_race_protection

  food_item, created = get_or_create_with_race_protection(
      FoodItem,
      Q(name__iexact=name),
      {"name": name}
  )

  # Bad - manual handling
  try:
      food_item = FoodItem.objects.create(name=name)
  except IntegrityError:
      food_item = FoodItem.objects.get(name__iexact=name)
  ```

### Query Optimization
- **Prefetch relationships**: Use `select_related()` for foreign keys, `prefetch_related()` for reverse/M2M
- **Avoid N+1 in schemas**: When ModelSchema includes nested relationships, ensure the queryset prefetches them
- **Example**:
  ```python
  # Controller with proper prefetching
  def list_items(self) -> QuerySet[Item]:
      return Item.objects.select_related("category").prefetch_related("tags")
  ```

### Service Layer Patterns

This project uses a **hybrid approach** to services: function-based for stateless operations, class-based for stateful workflows. This is intentional.

#### When to Use Function-Based Services
- **Single-purpose operations**: CRUD, validation, simple queries
- **Cross-entity operations**: Operations spanning multiple models without shared context
- **Utility helpers**: Formatting, calculations, lookups

```python
# Good - stateless operations as functions
def add_to_blacklist(organization: Organization, email: str, ...) -> Blacklist:
    return Blacklist.objects.create(organization=organization, email=email, ...)

def create_venue(organization: Organization, payload: VenueCreateSchema) -> Venue:
    return Venue.objects.create(organization=organization, **payload.model_dump())
```

#### When to Use Class-Based Services
- **Request-scoped workflows**: Operations that share context (user, event, organization)
- **Multi-step processes**: Checkout flows, eligibility checks, complex validations
- **Stateful computations**: When you'd pass the same 3+ arguments to multiple related functions

```python
# Good - stateful workflow as class
class BatchTicketService:
    def __init__(self, event: Event, tier: TicketTier, user: RevelUser) -> None:
        self.event = event
        self.tier = tier
        self.user = user

    def create_batch(self, items: list[TicketPurchaseItem]) -> list[Ticket] | str:
        # Validates batch size, resolves seats, delegates to payment flow
        ...
```

#### Mixed Modules Are OK
A single service module can contain both patterns when they serve different purposes:
- `batch_ticket_service.py` has `BatchTicketService` (ticket purchase workflow) and `ticket_service.py` has `check_in_ticket()` (standalone operation)
- This is intentional - don't force everything into one pattern

#### Controller Integration
```python
# Function-based - import module, call directly
from events.service import blacklist_service
entry = blacklist_service.add_to_blacklist(organization, email=email)

# Class-based - instantiate per request
from events.service.batch_ticket_service import BatchTicketService
service = BatchTicketService(event=event, tier=tier, user=user)
result = service.create_batch(items=purchase_items)
```

#### Why Not Dependency Injection?
We intentionally avoid Django Ninja Extra's DI container because:
- Our services are **request-contextual** (need user, event, etc.) - doesn't fit singleton pattern
- Explicit instantiation makes code **traceable** (grep finds all usages)
- No framework lock-in beyond Django Ninja
- KISS principle - manual instantiation is simple and clear

## Note to claude
- Do not run tests. Let the user run the tests.
- Always discuss implementation approach before writing code for non-trivial changes.
