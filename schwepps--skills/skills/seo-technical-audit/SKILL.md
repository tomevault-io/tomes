# Technical SEO Audit Framework

Professional methodology for comprehensive technical SEO analysis aligned with 2025 best practices.

## When to Use This Skill

- Full technical SEO audits
- Diagnosing crawling/indexation issues
- Core Web Vitals analysis
- Site architecture review
- Schema markup validation
- Mobile-first readiness assessment
- AI crawler configuration audit

## Audit Workflow

Execute in priority order—crawlability issues block all downstream optimizations.

### Phase 1: Crawlability & Indexation (CRITICAL)

```
1. robots.txt Analysis
   □ Accessible at /robots.txt
   □ No global Disallow: /
   □ CSS/JS not blocked
   □ Sitemap reference present

2. XML Sitemap Validation
   □ Only canonical, 200-status URLs
   □ No noindex pages included
   □ Submitted to GSC

3. Indexation Status (GSC)
   □ Check indexed vs excluded pages
   □ Identify "Crawled - not indexed"
   □ Find soft 404s
   □ Verify canonical consistency

4. Meta Robots
   □ Key pages: index,follow
   □ No accidental noindex
   □ Canonical self-references
```

### Phase 2: Core Web Vitals (2025 Standards)

**Passing Thresholds:**
| Metric | Good | Needs Improvement | Poor |
|--------|------|-------------------|------|
| LCP | ≤2.5s | 2.5-4.0s | >4.0s |
| INP | ≤200ms | 200-500ms | >500ms |
| CLS | ≤0.10 | 0.10-0.25 | >0.25 |

**Data Sources (Priority Order):**
1. Google Search Console (field data)
2. CrUX Dashboard (field data)
3. PageSpeed Insights (lab + field)

**Common Fixes:**
- LCP: Optimize images, preload critical resources, reduce server response time
- INP: Break up long tasks, optimize JavaScript, use web workers
- CLS: Set dimensions on images/embeds, avoid inserting content above existing

### Phase 3: Site Architecture

```
Optimal Structure:
□ Max 3 clicks from homepage to any page
□ Flat hierarchy (avoid deep nesting)
□ Logical URL structure: /category/subcategory/page
□ Breadcrumb navigation implemented
□ Internal linking strategy documented

URL Best Practices:
□ Descriptive, keyword-relevant
□ Lowercase, hyphens (not underscores)
□ Under 60 characters
□ No parameters when possible
```

### Phase 4: Mobile-First Readiness

```
□ Mobile-friendly test passes
□ Responsive design (no horizontal scroll)
□ Touch targets ≥48px
□ Font size ≥16px base
□ No intrusive interstitials
□ Same content on mobile and desktop
```

### Phase 5: Security & HTTPS

```
□ HTTPS with valid certificate
□ HTTP → HTTPS redirects (301)
□ No mixed content warnings
□ HSTS header implemented
□ Security headers present (CSP, X-Frame-Options)
```

### Phase 6: Structured Data

**Priority Schema Types:**
1. Organization/LocalBusiness
2. BreadcrumbList
3. Article/BlogPosting (with author)
4. Product (for e-commerce)
5. FAQPage (for AI visibility)
6. HowTo (for tutorials)

**Validation:**
- Google Rich Results Test
- Schema.org validator
- Check for warnings, not just errors

### Phase 7: AI Crawler Configuration

**2025 robots.txt for AI Search:**
```
# Allow AI search crawlers
User-agent: OAI-SearchBot
Allow: /

User-agent: ChatGPT-User
Allow: /

User-agent: PerplexityBot
Allow: /

User-agent: ClaudeBot
Allow: /

# Optional: Block AI training (not search)
User-agent: GPTBot
Disallow: /

User-agent: Google-Extended
Disallow: /
```

1. **[Issue]** - [Impact] - [Fix]
2. **[Issue]** - [Impact] - [Fix]
3. **[Issue]** - [Impact] - [Fix]

## Detailed Findings
[Category-by-category analysis]

## Action Plan

**Immediate (This Week):**
- [ ] Critical fix 1
- [ ] Critical fix 2

**Short-term (This Month):**
- [ ] High priority 1
- [ ] High priority 2

**Ongoing:**
- [ ] Monitoring task 1
- [ ] Regular audit 2
```

## Scoring Guide

- **90-100:** Excellent - Minor optimizations only
- **70-89:** Good - Some improvements needed
- **50-69:** Needs Work - Significant gaps
- **Below 50:** Critical - Major overhaul required

## Quick Audit (5-Point Check)

For rapid assessments:
1. **Indexation** - Are key pages indexed? (GSC)
2. **Speed** - Core Web Vitals passing? (LCP <2.5s)
3. **Mobile** - Mobile-friendly test pass?
4. **Security** - HTTPS with valid cert?
5. **Crawlability** - robots.txt not blocking content?

## Tools Reference

```bash
# Check robots.txt
curl -s https://example.com/robots.txt

# Check response headers
curl -I https://example.com

# Fetch and validate sitemap
curl -s https://example.com/sitemap.xml | head -50

# Check mobile-friendliness (requires API key)
# Use Google's Mobile-Friendly Test: https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly
```
