# Business Profile Creator

Create a structured business profile that captures your company's identity, offerings, positioning, and brand voice for use in AI-assisted content creation.

## When to Use This Skill

- Setting up a new writing system
- Onboarding a new client
- Updating business information after pivots or changes
- Creating context for a new brand or product line

## Interview Process

### Phase 1: Company Overview

Ask these questions one at a time, waiting for responses:

1. "What is your company/brand name?"
2. "In one sentence, what do you do?" (This becomes the tagline)
3. "Why does your company exist? What's the deeper purpose?" (Mission)
4. "Where is your company heading in the next 3-5 years?" (Vision)

### Phase 2: Value Proposition

5. "What's the #1 result or transformation you help people achieve?"
6. "How do you uniquely deliver this result? What's your method or approach?"
7. "What are 3 things that set you apart from alternatives?"

### Phase 3: Offerings

8. "List your paid products/services with brief descriptions and price points"
9. "What free resources do you offer (newsletter, lead magnets, community, etc.)?"

### Phase 4: Positioning

10. "How would you describe your market position (premium, accessible, etc.)?"
11. "What category do you compete in?"
12. "What's your specific niche or area of focus?"

### Phase 5: Brand Voice

13. "How would you describe your brand's personality in 3-5 words?"
14. "What's the overall tone of your communication?"
15. "What values do you want to demonstrate through your content?"

### Phase 6: Social Proof & Platforms

16. "What are your key metrics or achievements? (subscribers, clients, revenue, features)"
17. "What do clients commonly say about working with you?"
18. "What platforms are you active on? Include handles/URLs."

### Phase 7: Content Strategy

19. "What are your 3 main content topics or pillars?"
20. "What's your primary call-to-action for content?"

## Output Format

After gathering responses, generate a JSON file following this structure:

```json
{
  "business_profile": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "last_updated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "company_overview": {

    },

    },
    "calls_to_action": {
      "primary_cta": {},
      "secondary_ctas": []
    },
    "platforms": {}
  }
}
```

## Instructions

1. Begin with: "I'll help you create your business profile. This will take about 10-15 minutes. I'll ask questions one at a time - just answer naturally."

2. Ask questions conversationally, one at a time

3. If answers are vague, ask clarifying follow-ups

4. After all questions, generate the complete JSON

5. Save the output to `/context/business-profile.json`

6. Provide a summary of the key elements captured

## Best Practices

- Keep the tone professional but friendly
- Help users articulate ideas they may struggle to express
- Suggest improvements or clarifications when answers are unclear
- Validate that the profile captures their unique positioning
