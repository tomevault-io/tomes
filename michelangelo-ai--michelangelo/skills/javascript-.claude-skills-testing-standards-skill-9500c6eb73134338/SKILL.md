# Testing Patterns

## What to Test

- **User-facing behavior** — test what users see and interact with, not internal component structure
- **Business logic** — test your decisions, not the tools implementing them
- **Success path + key edge cases** — skip scenarios already covered by dependencies
- **No duplication** — if higher-level tests cover the behavior, don't also test the implementation details

## Mocking Strategy

| Mock                                          | Don't mock                                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| External APIs, RPC calls, server dependencies | Internal hooks and components               |
|                                               | React context                               |
|                                               | Well-tested utilities                       |
|                                               | Dependencies already comprehensively tested |

## Test Organization

- Place tests in the closest `__tests__/` directory to the tested code (create it if it does not exist)
- Use `describe` blocks only when tests benefit from grouping (shared setup, related assertions)
- Keep tests flat when individual test names provide enough context
- Prefer `expect(fn(args)).toEqual(result)` over assigning to intermediate variables

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Testing implementation details (`container.firstChild`, verifying props passed to children)
- ❌ Duplicating behavior across unit and integration tests — pick the right level
- ❌ Testing scenarios already covered by the dependency being used
