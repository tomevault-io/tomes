description: Apply when adding, writing, or reviewing comments or JSDoc in any file. Also apply when making significant code changes that introduce non-obvious logic, public APIs, or edge cases that likely need documentation. Covers when to write JSDoc vs. when to skip it entirely, and inline comment standards. Use when this capability is needed.

# Documentation Patterns

## JSDoc

**Add JSDoc when a function has:**
- Non-obvious behavior (error handling, side effects, special logic)
- Edge cases that need clarification (null handling, validation, fallback behavior)
- A public API shared across multiple features

**Skip JSDoc for:**
- Simple getters/setters that match their TypeScript signature
- Internal implementation details

**Focus on "why" over "what"** — explain behavior and decisions, not syntax. Include examples for complex functions.

## Inline Comments

Use for non-obvious implementation decisions, not to narrate obvious code:

```typescript
// ✅ Explains a non-obvious decision
// Ignore localStorage errors (quota exceeded, private browsing, etc.)

// ✅ Explains a non-obvious transformation
// Convert MM/DD/YYYY to YYYY/MM/DD for API consistency

// ❌ Narrates what the code already says
// gets the pipeline run based on name
```

## Prefer Renaming Over Commenting

Before adding a comment to explain what a function does, ask whether a better name would make the comment unnecessary. A well-named function with a clear TypeScript signature is self-documenting.

```typescript
// ❌ Compensating comment because the name is weak
// Recursively flattens a nested error object into dot-notation string keys
function flattenErrors(obj: Record<string, unknown>): Record<string, string>

// ✅ Name makes the comment redundant
function flattenErrorsToDotPaths(obj: Record<string, unknown>): Record<string, string>
```

## Avoid

- Restating what the TypeScript signature already expresses
- AI/agent references in documentation
