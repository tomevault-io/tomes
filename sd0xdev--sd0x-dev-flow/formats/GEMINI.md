# sd0x-dev-flow — Harness Engineering for Claude Code

## Required Checks (Stop Hook enforced)

| Change Type | Must Run | Can Skip |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| code files | `/codex-review-fast` -> `/precommit` | - |
| `.md` docs | `/codex-review-doc` | `/codex-review-fast` |
| Comments only | - | All |

Before PR: `/pr-review`

## Workflow

```
Feature: develop -> write tests -> /verify -> /codex-review-fast + /codex-test-review -> /precommit -> /pr-review
Bug fix: /issue-analyze -> /bug-fix -> investigate -> fix -> regression test -> /verify -> /codex-review-fast -> /precommit
```

### Auto-Loop Rule ⚠️

After editing code or docs, you **MUST** run the review command **in the same reply** — do not stop, do not ask, do not just summarize.

| After editing... | Immediately run | Then on pass |
|------------------|----------------|--------------|
| code files | `/codex-review-fast` | `/precommit` |
| `.md` docs | `/codex-review-doc` | (done) |
| Review found issues | Fix all → re-run same review | — |

**Declaring ≠ Executing**: Saying "should run review" without invoking the Skill tool is a violation.
**Summary ≠ Completion**: Outputting a table then stopping is a violation.

Full spec: @rules/auto-loop.md

## Test Requirements

| Change Type | Required Tests | File Mapping |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| New script/skill | `test/` required | `scripts/xxx.sh` -> `test/scripts/xxx.test.js` |
| Modify existing logic | Existing pass + new logic | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` -> `test/skills/<name>.test.js` |
| Bug fix | Regression test | - |

Coverage: happy path + error handling + edge cases (null, empty, extremes)

## Development Rules

1. **Reference existing code** -- find similar files first, keep style consistent
2. **Test command** -- `node --test test/**/*.test.js`
3. **Author attribution** -- use developer's GitHub username, never AI names (exception: `/smart-commit --ai-co-author`). Forbidden patterns in commit messages **and PR title/body** (canonical source: `scripts/commit-msg-guard.sh`): Co-Authored-By AI, Generated-by tags, emoji robot tags. Commits: install `commit-msg-guard.sh` via `/install-scripts`. PRs: `/create-pr` Step 4b enforces sanitization automatically.
4. **No auto-commit** -- Claude must not run `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` (exception: `/push-ci` may execute `git push` after user approval; `/smart-commit --execute` may execute `git add` + `git commit` after user approval)

## Tech Stack

Node.js . JavaScript . node:test

## Key Entrypoints

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/run-skill.sh` | Skill script runner |
| `package.json` | Project config |

## Footguns

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `!` context check: `ls`/`find` on home-dir paths blocked | Use `bash -c 'test -f "$HOME/..." && echo ok \|\| echo missing' 2>/dev/null \|\| echo "unknown (sandbox)"` |
| `!` context check: `allowed-tools` must match | If `allowed-tools: Bash(bash:*)`, wrap all `!` checks in `bash -c '...'` |
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` unavailable in command `.md` | Cannot narrow `allowed-tools` to specific script paths; use `Bash(bash:*)` until [#9354](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/9354) resolved |
| `!` context check: jq `()` triggers permission parser | Use `gh --template` (Go templates): `--template '{{.field}}'` — `{{ }}` is not shell-special |
| Background process monitoring | Use Monitor tool for streaming stdout (e.g., `gh run watch`); `Bash(run_in_background)` for one-shot completion notification |
| `sleep N` (N >= 2) as first Bash command | Blocked by harness; retry via re-execution or use Monitor for process waiting |

## Rules

- @rules/fix-all-issues.md -- Zero tolerance
- @rules/testing.md -- Test pyramid, conventions, evidence model, adequacy gate
- @rules/testing-project.md -- Project-specific testing overrides (user-owned)
- @rules/framework.md
- @rules/security.md
- @rules/docs-writing.md
- @rules/docs-numbering.md
