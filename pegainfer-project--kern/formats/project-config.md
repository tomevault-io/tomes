# kern

A model-agnostic GPU runtime. A model ships as a manifest (a typed declaration
of buffers, states, ops and programs), compiled kernels, and weights. The
runtime verifies the manifest, then executes it blindly. **It contains no model
and never will.** Anything that knows a model's name, layer count, head size or
decoding trick belongs in a generator under `tools/` or in the manifest itself,
never in `crates/`. When a change to `crates/` wants a model-specific branch,
the design is wrong, not the model.

`docs/` is the design record (mostly Chinese); code, comments and commit
messages are English. `docs/manifest.md`, `runtime.md`, `serve.md`,
`spec-decode.md`, `test.md`, `registry.md` are the contracts; `docs/roadmap.md` is what is
being built and the gate that closes each item; `docs/lessons.md` is what went
wrong before and the rule each incident left behind — read it before a gate.

Only judgment lives in this file. Anything a machine can check (formatting,
the schema golden, lints) belongs in CI, not here.

## Orientation

- `crates/kern-manifest` — types, schema, `verify`. Verification collects every
  diagnostic; it never stops at the first.
- `crates/kern-pool` — the states' accounting: chunks, pages and slots,
  leases, the checkpoint table, the host tier. Pure host code with no CUDA;
  every decision comes back as a plan the runtime executes.
- `crates/kern-runtime` — loads a verified manifest, allocates, lowers programs
  to flat launch lists, runs them. The only crate that touches CUDA.
- `crates/kern-test` — the `kern test` harness: static diff, tap, noise
  floor, fuzz, perf, verdict, spoken to a `Side`. Pure host code with no
  CUDA; its tests drive a fake side.
- `crates/kern-run` — the `kern` binary (`run` / `test` / `kernels`),
  `kern.toml`, the real `Side` over `Runtime`.
- `crates/kern-serve` — the pegainfer/vLLM front end plus `KernScheduler`.
  A workspace member outside `default-members`: builds where protoc and
  libssl-dev are (the kernel-lab container, the release runner), by name.
- `tools/dsv41/**/Cargo.toml` — GPU harnesses over the runtime's public API;
  workspace members, built by name.
- `tools/` — capture, extract, export, manifest generators. Model knowledge
  lives here.
- GPU tests need a free GPU on a shared tray: `nvidia-smi` before `kern test`.

## What we prefer

The runtime is small and that is a feature. The project's thesis (forward is
a typed pure function; state lives only at the boundary) applies to the code
that implements it: `kern-pool` decides, `kern-runtime` runs what it decided.

**Functional core, imperative shell.** Logic is `fn(data) -> data`. Effects
(CUDA, the clock, the ledger, files, logging) sit in a thin layer that does no
branching. If a function needs a GPU to be tested, the decision it makes
should move into a pure function that returns a plan; the shell only stages,
runs and reads back. `Pool` / `Lease` in `kern-pool` are the model: pure host
code that `Runtime` wraps.

**A type exists because something was checked when it was built.** `Lease`,
`Contract`, `Policy`, `Topology`: constructed by a `check` / `new` that returns
`Result`; after that the invariant travels with the type and nothing
downstream re-checks it. Parse, don't validate. A plain `Vec<i64>` of slots is
a smell; a `Lease` that can only hand out its own slots is the fix.

**Errors say who acts.** `kern_runtime::Error` is grouped by who has to fix it
(provider, artifact, caller). A message names the manifest object in backticks
and states expected versus got. `unwrap` / `expect` only for states the code
has already ruled out; anything reachable from input is an `Err`.

**Deterministic by construction.** No clock reads, no randomness, no
iteration-order dependence inside logic. Same input, same bytes out. Running
twice and diffing is a legitimate test, and a difference is a bug even when
both outputs look right.

**Comments explain the contract and the why, never the what.** The module doc
is the module's design doc, in prose (scheduler.rs and kern-runtime/lib.rs set
the standard). Function docs: one to three sentences, sentence case, no "This
function…". An inline comment justifies a non-obvious choice ("padding rows
write into a page nobody reads"). Work that is not done goes in
`docs/roadmap.md`, not in a source comment.

**Names.** Short locals in short scopes (`m`, `rt`, `s`, `q`); full words for
fields and public API. A type is the noun for the thing (`Lease`, not
`LeaseManager`). No `Helper`, `Util`, `Manager`, `_v2`, `new_`, `_impl`.

**Small.** No abstraction for one caller. No trait until there are two
implementations (`Scheduler` is pegainfer's, not ours). Prefer deleting to
adding. When a file outgrows what its module doc describes, split along a
contract, not along a line count.

**No compatibility layers.** Break the schema, bump the version, regenerate the
golden. No shims, no deprecated paths, no flags that keep old behavior alive.

**Dependencies are decisions.** A new crate is named in the commit message
with the reason it is worth its weight. CUDA-adjacent crates stay pinned
exact; pegainfer stays pinned by rev and is bumped deliberately.

## Gates

Nothing is done until its gate closes; a PR is not done until CI is green.
