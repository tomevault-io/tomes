# OpenTradex — Risk Snapshot

Quick daily risk read.

## Flow

1. Run the risk snapshot:
   !`node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/tradex.js" risk`
2. If `panicCooldown > Date.now()`, tell the user trading is paused until cooldown expires and show the expiry.
3. If `dailyTotal <= -100`, warn the user they're near a self-imposed daily loss limit; suggest they pause or reduce size.
4. Format the output as:
   ```
   Open: N positions · exposure $X
   Today: realized $X · unrealized $X · total $X
   ```

## Rules

- Don't give financial advice. Report numbers and flag risk thresholds.
- Never invent numbers — only echo what the ledger returns.
