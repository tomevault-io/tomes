# Booking Notifications (Dual-Channel)

Automated booking notifications via two channels:

| Channel  | Delivery  | Format     | Use Case                                   |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Telegram | Scheduled | HTML       | Interactive commands, daily digest, search |
| Pushover | Real-time | Plain text | Emergency alerts with custom sound (dune)  |

> **Self-Evolving Skill**: This skill improves through use. If instructions are wrong, parameters drifted, or a workaround was needed — fix this file immediately, don't defer. Only update for real, reproducible issues.

## Mandatory Preflight

### Step 1: Check Sync Script Exists

```bash
ls -la "$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-skills/plugins/calcom-commander/scripts/sync.ts" 2>/dev/null || echo "SCRIPT_NOT_FOUND"
```

### Step 2: Verify Environment (Required)

```bash
echo "CALCOM_OP_UUID: ${CALCOM_OP_UUID:-NOT_SET}"
echo "TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN: ${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN:+SET}"
echo "TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID: ${TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID:-NOT_SET}"
echo "HAIKU_MODEL: ${HAIKU_MODEL:-NOT_SET}"
```

**All must be SET.** If any are NOT_SET, run the setup command first.

### Step 3: Verify Pushover (Optional)

```bash
echo "PUSHOVER_APP_TOKEN: ${PUSHOVER_APP_TOKEN:+SET}"
echo "PUSHOVER_USER_KEY: ${PUSHOVER_USER_KEY:+SET}"
echo "PUSHOVER_SOUND: ${PUSHOVER_SOUND:-dune}"
echo "WEBHOOK_RELAY_URL: ${WEBHOOK_RELAY_URL:-NOT_SET}"
```

**If NOT_SET**: Pushover is optional. Telegram-only operation still works. To enable, see [pushover-setup.md](./references/pushover-setup.md).

### Step 4: Verify Cal.com CLI Binary

```bash
ls -la "$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-skills/plugins/calcom-commander/scripts/calcom-cli/calcom" 2>/dev/null || echo "BINARY_NOT_FOUND"
```

**If BINARY_NOT_FOUND**: Build it:

```bash
cd "$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-skills/plugins/calcom-commander/scripts/calcom-cli" && bun install && bun run build
```

## Notification Channels

### Telegram (Scheduled Sync)

6h polling via launchd. Sends HTML-formatted messages for:

| Category     | Examples                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| NEW BOOKING  | New interview scheduled, new consultation booked |
| CANCELLATION | Booking cancelled by attendee, host cancelled    |
| UPCOMING     | Booking starting in 1 hour, today's schedule     |
| RESCHEDULED  | Booking moved to new time, date changed          |

### Pushover (Real-Time Webhook)

Instant notifications via Cloud Run webhook relay:

| Event       | Priority      | Sound | Must Acknowledge? |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----- | ----------------- |
| New booking | 2 (Emergency) | dune  | Yes               |
| Rescheduled | 2 (Emergency) | dune  | Yes               |
| Cancelled   | 0 (Normal)    | dune  | No                |

### Webhook Relay

The webhook relay is a lightweight Cloud Run service that bridges Cal.com webhooks to Pushover. See [webhook-relay.md](./references/webhook-relay.md) for deployment.

## Running Manually

```bash
cd ~/own/amonic && bun run "$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-skills/plugins/calcom-commander/scripts/sync.ts"
```

## Sync Behavior

1. Fetches bookings from Cal.com API (last 6h window)
2. Compares against last-known state (file-based)
3. Detects new bookings, cancellations, and reschedules
4. Sends Telegram notification (HTML) for each change
5. Sends Pushover notification (plain text) if credentials configured
6. Updates state file for next sync cycle
7. Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures on API errors

## mise Configuration (Agnostic Wiring)

Any repository can adopt these notifications by adding to `.mise.local.toml`:

```toml
[env]
# Required (Telegram)
CALCOM_OP_UUID = "<1password-uuid>"
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "<bot-token>"
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = "<chat-id>"

# Optional (Pushover dual-channel)
PUSHOVER_APP_TOKEN = "<pushover-app-token>"
PUSHOVER_USER_KEY = "<pushover-user-key>"
PUSHOVER_SOUND = "dune"
WEBHOOK_RELAY_URL = "https://calcom-pushover-webhook-XXXXX.us-central1.run.app/"
```

## Post-Change Checklist

- [ ] YAML frontmatter valid (no colons in description)
- [ ] Trigger keywords current
- [ ] Path patterns use $HOME not hardcoded paths
- [ ] Pushover graceful degradation verified (works without Pushover creds)


## Post-Execution Reflection

After this skill completes, reflect before closing the task:

0. **Locate yourself.** — Find this SKILL.md's canonical path before editing.
1. **What failed?** — Fix the instruction that caused it.
2. **What worked better than expected?** — Promote to recommended practice.
3. **What drifted?** — Fix any script, reference, or dependency that no longer matches reality.
4. **Log it.** — Evolution-log entry with trigger, fix, and evidence.

Do NOT defer. The next invocation inherits whatever you leave behind.
