# MQL5 Article Extractor

Extract technical trading articles from mql5.com for training data collection. **Scope limited to mql5.com domain only.**

> **Self-Evolving Skill**: This skill improves through use. If instructions are wrong, parameters drifted, or a workaround was needed — fix this file immediately, don't defer. Only update for real, reproducible issues.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Extracting articles from mql5.com for reference or training data

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                  | Cause                         | Solution                                          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Non-mql5.com URL       | Skill only supports mql5.com  | Use other tools for non-mql5.com sites            |
| Article not found      | Invalid article ID or removed | Verify URL exists by visiting in browser          |
| User ID not recognized | Wrong user ID format          | Use numeric ID from profile URL or exact username |
| Empty extraction       | Rate limiting or site change  | Wait and retry, check for site structure changes  |
| Permission denied      | Working directory mismatch    | Run from $HOME/eon/mql5 directory                 |
| Batch too large        | Too many articles requested   | Limit batch size, use URL list file               |
| Missing dependencies   | Required tools not installed  | Install curl, jq for extraction                   |
| Output encoding issues | Unicode in article content    | Ensure UTF-8 output handling                      |


## Post-Execution Reflection

After this skill completes, check before closing:

1. **Did the command succeed?** — If not, fix the instruction or error table that caused the failure.
2. **Did parameters or output change?** — If the underlying tool's interface drifted, update Usage examples and Parameters table to match.
3. **Was a workaround needed?** — If you had to improvise (different flags, extra steps), update this SKILL.md so the next invocation doesn't need the same workaround.

Only update if the issue is real and reproducible — not speculative.
