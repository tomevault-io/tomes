name: cross-review
description: Delegate code review to a subagent running a specific model. Use ONLY when user explicitly names a model to review changes ("review with opus", "use sonnet to review", "review with gemini"). The root agent reconstructs changes from conversation history and spawns a subagent with the code-review skill using the specified model. Do NOT use for general code review (use code-review skill instead), for reviewing PRs from git history, or when no model is specified by the user. Use when this capability is needed.

Reconstruct what you changed during this conversation, then delegate the actual review to a single subagent running the `code-review` skill with a user-specified model.

IMPORTANT: Steps 1-2 run in the current agent (the master). Only Step 3 spawns a subagent.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Parse the user request

Extract:
- **Model**: The model ID from user's request. Validate against available models.
- **Review instructions**: Any text after "Review instructions:" — pass verbatim.
- **Change scope**: What should be reviewed. Default: all changes in this conversation.

### Step 2: Gather context from your own changes

Reconstruct the diff from conversation history:

1. Compose a unified diff of all changes (Edit, Write, Bash, etc.). Group by file.
   - **If no changes**: Inform user and stop.

2. Read final state of changed files for surrounding context.

3. Check related context:
   - Test files related to changed files (skip `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `build`)
   - Config changes that affect behavior
   - Related type definitions or interfaces

Do NOT show gathered context to user. Use only for the subagent.

### Step 3: Spawn the review subagent

```
spawn_subagent:
  skill: "code-review"
  model: <model from user request>
  prompt: |
    Review the changes below using "code-review" skill.

    CONSTRAINTS:
    - Read-only review. Do NOT edit files.
    - All context is provided below. Read files only if clearly incomplete.
    - Review independently and objectively.

    ## Review Instructions
    {user's review instructions, verbatim}

    ## Changes
    {reconstructed diff, grouped by file}

    ## Additional Context
    {links to related files, tests, type definitions, requirements}
```

### Step 4: Relay the result — READ-ONLY, NO ACTIONS

CRITICAL: Output the subagent's review AS-IS. Do NOT:
- Summarize, rephrase, reorder, or filter
- Fix, improve, or refactor based on findings
- Add your own commentary or caveats

One-line model attribution is acceptable. You may offer to implement recommendations, but let the user decide.

## Model Mapping

When user says "review with [model name]", map to a valid model ID:

| User says | Model ID |
|-----------|----------|
| opus, claude opus | claude-3-opus |
| sonnet, claude sonnet | claude-3.5-sonnet |
| gpt-4, gpt4 | gpt-4 |
| gpt-4o | gpt-4o |
| gemini | gemini-2.0-flash |
| deepseek | deepseek-chat |

If the model name is unrecognized, ask for the exact model ID.

## Error Handling

- **Subagent fails or times out**: Inform user. Suggest retry or different model.
- **No changes in conversation**: Inform user and stop.
- **Incomplete review**: Relay what was returned. Note it may be incomplete.
- **Model not available**: Offer alternative from the mapping table.
- **User requests unknown model**: Map fuzzy names to model IDs using the mapping table. If no match, ask user to provide the exact model ID string.
- **Subagent returns malformed output**: The review subagent may return text instead of structured findings. Relay what was returned and note the format deviation.
- **Diff context exceeds subagent limits**: For very large changesets, split the diff by file or module and run multiple sequential subagent reviews. Inform user you are splitting the review.
- **Network or infrastructure failure during spawn**: Retry once with the same configuration. If it fails again, offer to switch to a different model or perform the review inline.
- **Subagent produces factually incorrect findings**: Relay findings as-is but append a note that some claims could not be verified against the codebase. Do not filter or censor.

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Using cross-review for general PR review | User did not name a model. cross-review is for explicit model-named delegation only. | Use the standard `code-review` skill instead. |
| Summarizing or filtering subagent output | The user requested an independent review. Any distortion defeats the purpose. | Relay output verbatim. Add only a 1-line model attribution. |
| Acting on findings without user approval | The master agent is read-only in this workflow. Fixing issues automatically breaks the delegation contract. | Offer to implement recommendations but wait for user to decide. |
| Skipping context gathering (Step 2) | Sending only the diff without file context produces shallow reviews that miss type errors and behavioral changes. | Always read final file state and related test/config files before spawning the subagent. |
| Delegating to the same model the user is already talking to | If user says "review with sonnet" and master agent IS sonnet, this is circular. | Use a different model than the one running the master agent. |
| Requesting review of unchanged code | cross-review only works on changes made in the current conversation. | If the user wants PR review from git, use the `code-review` skill directly. |

## Model Comparison Methodology

### When to use which model

| Model | Strengths | Best for |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Claude Opus 4 | Deep reasoning, security analysis, architectural review | Complex refactors, auth code |
| GPT-5 Codex | Code generation patterns, syntax accuracy | Implementation review, template checking |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | Multi-modal, context window size | Large PRs (200+ files), full-repo context |
| DeepSeek V4 | Fast, cost-effective, strong at bug detection | Routine PRs, quick checks |

### Confidence Scoring

Assign confidence (0.0-1.0) to each finding:
```
confidence = (models_agreeing / total_models) * evidence_score

evidence_score:
  1.0 = exact line + code excerpt proves the bug
  0.7 = logic analysis suggests probable issue
  0.4 = speculative (pattern matching without code walk)
  0.1 = style preference
```

Findings with confidence < 0.5 should be:
- Marked as "suggestion" not "finding"
- Never block a merge
- Phrased as questions: "Did you consider...?"

### Result Merging Strategy

1. Group by file + line range (+-5 lines)
2. If all 3 models agree: high confidence, use as primary finding
3. If 2 of 3 agree: medium confidence, note the dissenting model's view in details
4. If 1 of 3: low confidence, verify against code manually before including
5. Merge descriptions: take the most specific one, append key insights from others
6. Remove duplicates: same finding described differently -> keep clearest description

### Handling Conflicts

When models disagree:
- Don't default to majority -- investigate the code yourself
- The dissenting model may have caught something the others missed
- Present both views: "Claude suggests X, Gemini suggests Y"
- Let the human reviewer decide

## Checklist

- [ ] Valid model name passed (not an alias or unsupported ID)
- [ ] Diff or context reconstructed accurately from conversation history
- [ ] Subagent has the code-review skill loaded
- [ ] Review result captured from subagent output (not assumed)
- [ ] Fallback model specified if primary model is unavailable
