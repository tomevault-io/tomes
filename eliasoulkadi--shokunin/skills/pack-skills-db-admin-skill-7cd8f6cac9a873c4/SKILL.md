# Database Administrator

PostgreSQL production operations: backup, restore, monitoring, replication, and maintenance.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Run health check

```powershell
scripts/monitor-db.ps1 -Database myapp
```

Checks 7 metrics:
| Metric | Warning | Fail |
|--------|---------|------|
| Connection count | > 80% of max | > 95% of max |
| Active queries | > 10 | > 20 |
| Long-running (>5m) | Any | > 3 |
| Cache hit ratio | < 99% | < 95% |
| Dead tuple ratio | > 20% | > 40% |
| Index usage (unused) | > 5 | > 10 |

**If any metric is FAIL**: investigate immediately. See [references/postgres-admin.md](references/postgres-admin.md) for diagnosis and fix procedures.

### Step 2: Backup database

```powershell
# Full backup
scripts/backup-db.ps1 -Database myapp

# Custom output directory
scripts/backup-db.ps1 -Database myapp -OutputDir D:\backups

# Exclude large log tables
scripts/backup-db.ps1 -Database myapp -ExcludeTables @("audit_logs", "analytics_events")
```

The script creates: `myapp_2026-05-13_143022.dump` (custom format, compressed) and verifies the backup by restoring to a temp database and running a count query.

### Step 3: Set up scheduled backups

See [assets/backup-schedule-template.ps1](assets/backup-schedule-template.ps1) for the schedule template.

```powershell
# Schedule daily backup at 2 AM
schtasks /Create /SC DAILY /TN "DBBackup-myapp" /TR "powershell.exe -File C:\scripts\backup-schedule.ps1" /ST 02:00
```

**Retention policy:**
- Daily: keep 7
- Weekly: keep 4 (Sundays)
- Monthly: keep 3 (1st of month)

### Step 4: Configure connection pooling

```ini
# pgbouncer.ini for PostgreSQL pooling
[databases]
myapp = host=localhost port=5432 dbname=myapp

[pgbouncer]
listen_port = 6432
listen_addr = 127.0.0.1
auth_type = scram-sha-256
pool_mode = transaction
default_pool_size = 25
max_client_conn = 100
max_db_connections = 50
```

### Step 5: Set up replication (if needed)

See [references/postgres-admin.md](references/postgres-admin.md) for streaming and logical replication setup.

**Decision:**
| Need | Replication type |
|------|-----------------|
| Read scaling + HA | Streaming replication |
| Selective table sync | Logical replication |
| Upgrade with minimal downtime | Logical replication |
| Cross-version replication | Logical replication |

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Cause | Fix |
|----------|-------|-----|
| Backup fails with "out of memory" | Work_mem too high for dump | Reduce work_mem, increase maintenance_work_mem |
| PgBouncer rejects connections | pool_size exhausted | Increase default_pool_size, add more connections |
| Replication lag growing | WAL generation > apply rate | Add replicas, increase max_wal_size, tune apply workers |
| Long-running query blocking vacuum | snapshot held too long | Kill with pg_terminate_backend, tune idle_in_transaction_session_timeout |
| WAL directory filling disk | archive_command failing or wal_keep_size too high | Fix archiving, reduce wal_keep_size, increase max_wal_size |

## Production Checklist

- [ ] Automated daily backups with verification
- [ ] Retention policy configured (7 daily, 4 weekly, 3 monthly)
- [ ] PgBouncer with transaction pooling
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard (connection count, cache hit, bloat)
- [ ] Alerts for: connection > 80%, cache hit < 99%, replication lag > 60s
- [ ] Autovacuum tuned (scale_factor, threshold, naptime)
- [ ] WAL archiving for PITR
- [ ] Connection limits per database
- [ ] Statement timeout configured (30s default)
- [ ] Backups stored in different location than DB server

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Fix |
|-------------|-----|
| No automated backups | Schedule pg_dump with retention |
| No backup verification | Always restore-test backups |
| Default autovacuum settings | Tune for your workload |
| Direct connections in production | Always use PgBouncer |
| No replication monitoring | Check lag, WAL generation rate |
| Running out of disk for WAL | Monitor WAL directory, tune archiving |

## Streaming Replication Setup

### Primary server (postgresql.conf)
```
wal_level = replica
max_wal_senders = 5
wal_keep_size = 1024    # MB of WAL to retain
hot_standby = on        # Allow read-only queries on replica
```

### Primary server (pg_hba.conf)
```
host replication replicator 192.168.0.0/24 md5
```

### Replica setup
```bash
# 1. Create base backup
pg_basebackup -h primary_host -D /var/lib/postgresql/data -U replicator -P -R

# 2. Start replica
pg_ctl start -D /var/lib/postgresql/data

# 3. Verify replication
psql -c "SELECT client_addr, state, sync_state FROM pg_stat_replication;"
```

### PITR (Point-in-Time Recovery)

```bash
# On primary: configure WAL archiving
archive_mode = on
archive_command = 'cp %p /archive/%f'

# Take base backup
pg_basebackup -h localhost -D /backup/base -Ft -z -P

# Restore to point in time
# 1. Stop PostgreSQL
# 2. Restore base backup to data directory
# 3. Create recovery.signal file
# 4. Set recovery_target_time in postgresql.conf:
#    recovery_target_time = '2026-05-18 14:30:00'
# 5. Start PostgreSQL
```

### Vacuum Strategy

```sql
-- Check table bloat
SELECT schemaname, relname, n_live_tup, n_dead_tup,
       round(n_dead_tup * 100.0 / NULLIF(n_live_tup + n_dead_tup, 0), 2) AS dead_ratio
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Aggressive autovacuum for high-write tables
ALTER TABLE events SET (autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.01, autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit = 2000);

-- Manual VACUUM (non-blocking)
VACUUM (VERBOSE, ANALYZE) events;

-- VACUUM FULL (blocking, recovers disk space)
VACUUM FULL events;  -- Requires table lock. Only use during maintenance windows.
```

### Monitoring Queries

```sql
-- Active connections
SELECT state, count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity GROUP BY state;

-- Long-running queries (>5 min)
SELECT pid, now() - query_start AS duration, query
FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state != 'idle' AND now() - query_start > INTERVAL '5 minutes';

-- Cache hit ratio (should be >95%)
SELECT sum(blks_hit) * 100.0 / NULLIF(sum(blks_hit) + sum(blks_read), 0) AS cache_hit_ratio
FROM pg_stat_database WHERE datname = current_database();

-- Dead tuples accumulating
SELECT relname, n_dead_tup, last_autovacuum
FROM pg_stat_user_tables WHERE n_dead_tup > 10000 ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC;
```
