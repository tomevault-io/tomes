# Comprehensive Code Review

Run parallel specialized code reviews via subagents, covering architecture, security, performance, code quality, requirements compliance, and bugs. Merge findings and let the user act on them. Works with both GitHub PRs and local branch diffs.

## Variables

- `{TEMP_DIR}` — the OS temporary directory (e.g. `/tmp` on Unix, `%TEMP%` on Windows). Use it for all intermediate files.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine review mode

Check if the user provided a GitHub PR link.

- **PR mode**: A PR URL is provided matching `https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>/pull/<PR_NUMBER>`. Extract owner, repo, and PR number.
- **Local mode**: No PR URL provided. The review will be based on the diff between the current branch and its base branch, plus any uncommitted changes.

### Step 2: Fetch diff and task description via subagent

Call a subagent to gather all change details, save the diff, and checkout the correct branch.

**CRITICAL**: You MUST spawn a subagent for this step. Do NOT perform the diff-gathering, branch detection, or complexity assessment yourself.

Construct the subagent prompt as follows:

```
Gather the code change details for a comprehensive code review.

Mode: <PR mode or Local mode>
<If PR mode: Owner: <OWNER>, Repo: <REPO>, PR Number: <PR_NUMBER>>

Instructions:
- PR mode: Fetch PR details via GitHub API (title, description, diff). Use `gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --repo <OWNER>/<REPO> --json title,body` for metadata and `gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER> --repo <OWNER>/<REPO>` for the diff. Save diff to {TEMP_DIR}/review-diff-<branch>.patch.
- Local mode: Detect the current branch and its base branch (try main, master, develop). Use `git diff <base>...HEAD` for committed changes and `git diff` for uncommitted changes. Combine into {TEMP_DIR}/review-diff-<branch>.patch.
- Determine complexity: simple (<200 diff lines, single file/module), medium (200-800 lines, 2-5 files), hard (>800 lines, 6+ files, or touches architecture).
- Return: diff file path, diff line count, title, comprehensive task description, and complexity assessment.
```


Use a subagent tool to spawn the subagent. Use a powerful model since this involves complex reasoning to assess complexity.

The subagent will return:
- **Diff file path**: absolute path to the saved diff file (must start with `/`, e.g. `{TEMP_DIR}/review-diff-feature.patch`)
- **Diff line count**: total number of lines in the diff file
- **Title**: the PR title or summary from commits
- **Description**: comprehensive task description with all requirements
- **Complexity**: one of `simple`, `medium`, or `hard`

Remember these values for use in subsequent steps.

### Step 3: Run specialized reviews

The review strategy depends on the **complexity** returned by the fetch-diff subagent.

#### Review Criteria

Each subagent reviews the diff through one specialized lens:

| Criterion | What to review |
|-----------|---------------|
| architecture | Module boundaries, dependency direction, design patterns, SOLID principles, separation of concerns, circular dependencies, appropriate abstraction levels |
| security | OWASP Top 10, input validation, authentication/authorization, secret handling, injection risks, insecure deserialization, logging of sensitive data |
| performance | N+1 queries, unnecessary allocations, blocking operations, missing indexes, bundle size impact, render-blocking resources, memory leaks |
| code-quality | Readability, naming conventions, function length, error handling patterns, type safety, testability, consistent coding style |
| requirements-compliance | Does the change satisfy the stated task requirements? Are edge cases covered? Does it handle all user stories? Are acceptance criteria met? |
| bugs | Logic errors, off-by-one, null/undefined handling, race conditions, incorrect state transitions, missing error handling, incorrect assumptions |

> **Note:** This skill is self-contained. Referenced files (criteria/*.md, fetch-diff.md, scripts/post_review.js) are placeholders for future expansion. All review instructions and criteria are defined inline above.

#### Strategy A: Simple complexity

For **simple** PRs, perform the review yourself (the root agent) without calling subagents.

1. Read the Review Criteria table above to understand each review lens.
2. Read the diff file.
3. Apply all criteria to review the change yourself, producing findings as a flat list without priorities (same format as subagents would). You will assign priorities in Step 4.

#### Strategy B: Medium complexity

For **medium** PRs, launch **6 parallel subagent calls** — one per review criterion.

**CRITICAL**: You MUST spawn subagents for this step. Do NOT perform the reviews yourself.

Use a subagent tool to spawn each subagent. Select the single most powerful model from each available provider. Alternate these models across the 6 criteria (e.g., provider A's best model for criteria 1, 3, 5 and provider B's best model for criteria 2, 4, 6). If only 1 provider is available, use its most powerful model for all 6.

Construct prompts for subagents as follows:

```
Review the following change through the {criterion} lens. Apply the criteria defined in the Review Criteria table for this category.

## <title>

### Task Description
<task description>

### Diff
Read the diff from file: <absolute path to diff file> (total lines: <diff line count>)

IMPORTANT: Do NOT invoke the Skill tool. Do NOT run tests, builds, linters, or type-checks — your review is based on static analysis only.
```

#### Strategy C: Hard complexity

For **hard** PRs, launch **2 parallel subagent calls per criterion** (12 total) — one per criterion per model, using 2 different models from different providers for diverse perspectives.

**CRITICAL**: You MUST spawn subagents for this step. Do NOT perform the reviews yourself.

**Model selection**: Choose exactly 2 models — the single most powerful model from each of 2 different providers. If only 1 provider is available, use its most powerful model for all 12 calls (fall back to Strategy B behavior with 2 calls per criterion).

Use a subagent tool to spawn each subagent.

For each of the 6 criteria, launch 2 subagents — one with each model.
Use following prompt:

```
Review the following change through the {criterion} lens. Apply the criteria defined in the Review Criteria table for this category.

## <title>

### Task Description
<task description>

### Diff
Read the diff from file: <absolute path to diff file> (total lines: <diff line count>)

IMPORTANT: Do NOT invoke the Skill tool. Do NOT run tests, builds, linters, or type-checks — your review is based on static analysis only.
```

All 12 calls should be launched in parallel.

### Step 4: Merge, filter, and prioritize results

Subagents return findings as flat lists without priority or severity labels. The root agent is responsible for deduplication, false-positive filtering, and priority assignment.

#### 4a. Collect and deduplicate

1. Collect all findings from each review (self-review or subagent responses).
2. Group findings by file and line number.
3. Merge issues that describe the same problem (same file, similar line range, same category). When merging, combine their review types. For **hard** PRs, findings from different models on the same criterion that agree strengthen confidence; findings from only one model should be noted as lower confidence.
4. Keep the best description, suggested fix, and **Diff line** from among duplicates. Track Diff line values internally for use in Step 7 but do NOT include them in the output shown to the user.

#### 4b. Filter false positives

Review each finding and discard it if:
- The subagent itself expressed doubt about whether it's a real issue.
- You can verify from the code context that the issue does not apply (e.g., the code is already protected by a guard the subagent missed, or the flagged pattern is intentional and correct).
- The finding is about a pre-existing issue not introduced by the change.

Be conservative — when in doubt, keep the finding.

#### 4c. Assign priorities

Assign a priority to each remaining finding using these levels:

| Priority | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| P0 | Critical — blocks merge, causes crashes/data loss/security breach | Must fix before merge |
| P1 | Major — significant issue affecting correctness, security, or maintainability | Must fix |
| P2 | Minor — real issue but low impact, improvement opportunity | Nice to fix |
| P3 | Suggestion — nitpick, style preference, optional enhancement | Optional |

When assigning priorities, consider:
- **Cross-criteria signal**: A finding flagged by multiple criteria (e.g., both architecture and security) is likely more important.
- **Blast radius**: Issues affecting hot paths, public APIs, or security boundaries deserve higher priority.
- **Confidence**: Findings confirmed by multiple models (hard PRs) or backed by concrete evidence deserve higher priority than speculative ones.
- **Context**: The same issue type may deserve different priorities depending on the codebase and change context.

#### 4d. Format output

Sort by priority (P0 first), then by file path. Each finding must be a standalone entry — do NOT bundle multiple distinct issues into a single row even if they are related.

```
## Comprehensive Review Findings

| # | Priority | Issue | File:Line | Review type |
|---|----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | P0 | Description | link to specific line in file | architecture(opus-4-6-think), security(gpt-5-3-codex) |
| 2 | P1 | Description | link to specific line in file | bugs(opus-4-6-think) |
| ... | | | | |

### Details

#### 1. [P0] Issue title
**File:** link to specific line in file
**Review type:** architecture(opus-4-6-think), security(gpt-5-3-codex)

Description and why it matters.

**Suggested fix:**
\`\`\`
code
\`\`\`
```

### Step 5: Ask user how to handle each finding

**Skip this step if the user already specified what to do with findings in their initial prompt** (e.g., "fix all issues", "post comments for all P0s", etc.). In that case, proceed directly to Steps 6/7 based on their instructions.

Otherwise, send a single message asking the user which findings to fix or post as comments. List each finding with its number, priority, and short description, and ask the user to reply with their choices.

- **PR mode**: Ask which issues to fix and which to post as PR comments.
- **Local mode**: Only ask which issues to fix. Do NOT mention posting comments.

### Step 6: Apply fixes for issues marked "Fix"

For each finding the user chose "Fix":

1. Read the relevant file and understand the surrounding context.
2. Apply the suggested fix (or an appropriate fix if the suggestion is incomplete).
3. After all fixes are applied, present a summary of changes made.

### Step 7: Post selected issues as PR comments (PR mode only)

**Skip this step entirely if no findings were marked "Post comment".**

Only applies in PR mode. Post line-specific comments via the GitHub API.

#### 7a. Build the review payload JSON

Construct a JSON object with this structure:

```json
{
  "event": "COMMENT",
  "body": "## Comprehensive Code Review\n\n### Findings Summary\n\n| Priority | Issue | Location | Review type |\n|----------|-------|----------|------------|\n| P0 | Issue title | `path/to/file.ts:42` | code-quality(gpt-5-3-codex) |\n\n### Recommendation\n[Concise recommendation]",
  "comments": [
    {
      "path": "path/to/file.ts",
      "line": 42,
      "side": "RIGHT",
      "body": "**[P0] Issue Title** (review type: code-quality(gpt-5-3-codex))\n\nDescription.\n\n**Suggested fix:**\n```\ncode\n```"
    }
  ]
}
```

For each finding marked "Post comment":
- `path`: the file path relative to repo root
- `line`: the line number for the comment. For `RIGHT` side, this is the new-file line number (from `+new_start,new_count` hunk range). For `LEFT` side, this is the old-file line number (from `-old_start,old_count` hunk range). Use the `Diff line` value from the findings table when the finding targets new/modified code. For findings targeting deleted code, use the old-file line number from the `-`-side of the diff hunk
- `side`: `RIGHT` for new/modified code, `LEFT` for deleted code. Use `LEFT` only when commenting on lines that were removed (shown with `-` prefix in the diff)
- `body`: include priority, title, review type with model name, description, and suggested fix
- Each finding gets its own comment — do NOT merge multiple findings into one comment

If user added custom notes to a finding, update description and/or suggested fix according to these notes.

Save the JSON to a file named `{TEMP_DIR}/review_payload-<branch-name>.json`.

#### 7b. Post via the script

Post each comment via the GitHub API using `gh api`:

```bash
gh api repos/<OWNER>/<REPO>/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/reviews --method POST -F "commit_id=$(gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --repo <OWNER>/<REPO> --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid)" -F "event=COMMENT" -F "body=<review-body>" -F "comments=<comments-json>"
```

Validate comment line numbers against the diff before posting. Adjust line numbers to the nearest valid diff line when close, and move out-of-range comments to the review body.

## Error Handling

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Subagent fails to spawn (timeout, model unavailable, API error) | Retry with a different model from another provider. If all models fail, fall back to Strategy A (root agent reviews all 6 criteria) and note reduced coverage in output |
| Diff file is empty or contains only binary/image changes | Report to user: "No reviewable text changes found." Skip subagents entirely. Do not force a review on empty or binary-only diffs |
| Fetch-diff subagent cannot determine base branch for local mode | Try `main` first, then `master`, then `develop`. If none exist, report error to user with the branches found and ask them to specify the base |
| Subagent returns findings without file:line references | Re-run that specific subagent with explicit instruction: "You MUST include file path and line number for every finding. Findings without location context cannot be used." |
| PR posting script fails with GitHub API authentication error (401/403) | Verify `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var is set with `repo` scope. For private repos, use a Personal Access Token with full repo access. Check token hasn't expired |
| Duplicate findings from parallel subagents cannot be auto-merged with confidence | Flag to user: "N findings reduced to M unique after deduplication. Manual review recommended for findings where subagents disagreed on severity or scope" |
| Diff exceeds 10,000 lines (hard complexity) — reviews take too long | Warn user before proceeding: "Diff is very large (N lines). Review quality decreases with size. Consider splitting into smaller PRs. Continue anyway?" |
| Posted PR comment line number doesn't match any diff hunk exactly | Auto-adjust to nearest valid line. If adjustment fails (line too far from any hunk), comment moves to review body instead |

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Reviewing without reading the task description or PR body | Misses context on intent. Flags intentional design decisions as bugs. Reviewer and author talk past each other | Always read task description first. Compare diff against stated requirements, not reviewer's assumptions |
| Nitpicking formatting, naming, and style only | Misses logic errors, security holes, and performance regressions. Creates false sense of thoroughness while letting real bugs through | Linting/formatting handled by CI. Review focuses on correctness, security, performance, architecture. Style comments are P3 at most |
| Requesting changes without suggesting alternative approach | Blocks contributor who then has to schedule another round-trip to discuss. Slows velocity | Every P0/P1 finding includes a concrete suggested fix or at minimum a direction. Reviewer invests time in solutions, not just problem-spotting |
| Rubber-stamping PRs from senior team members or frequent collaborators | Authority bias. Senior engineers make mistakes. Most post-mortems trace to "reviewed by peer who trusted author's experience" | Apply identical review criteria regardless of author seniority. If too busy, don't approve — ask another reviewer |
| Reviewing only the diff in isolation, not the integration surface | Change correct in isolation but breaks when composed with other recent changes or crosses module boundaries | Check out branch locally. Run full test suite. Grep for callers of modified functions. Check for merge conflicts and cross-module interactions |
| Blocking merge on P3 nits and stylistic preferences | Slows velocity without quality gain. Contributor spends time on changes that don't reduce bugs or improve performance | P3 = approve with optional suggestions. "Request changes" only for P0 and P1. Trust the contributor to decide on style preferences |
| Posting dozens of PR comments without prioritization | Overwhelms the author. They can't distinguish critical from cosmetic | Group and prioritize before posting. Top comment should summarize: X critical, Y major, Z minor. Critical issues get individual comments; minor issues can be batched in summary |
| Using review as a gatekeeping or knowledge-hoarding mechanism | Deliberately slow reviews to maintain information asymmetry. Toxic to team culture | Set SLA: review within 4 business hours. If blocked waiting for domain expert, note it and unblock with partial review |
