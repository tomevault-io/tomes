# Git Workflow

Automate the development cycle: branch, commit, PR, review, merge, cleanup. Follows conventional commits and trunk-based development.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Create a feature branch

```powershell
scripts/create-feature-branch.ps1 -Name "add-user-auth" -Type feat
```

This:
1. Detects default branch (main/master)
2. Fetches and pulls latest
3. Creates `feat/add-user-auth` from base
4. Pushes upstream with tracking

**Branch naming:**
| Type | Prefix | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Feature | `feat/` | `feat/add-user-auth` |
| Fix | `fix/` | `fix/login-redirect` |
| Docs | `docs/` | `docs/api-readme` |
| Refactor | `refactor/` | `refactor/auth-middleware` |
| Chore | `chore/` | `chore/update-deps` |

### Step 2: Make atomic commits

```powershell
scripts/auto-commit.ps1 -Scope "auth" -DryRun  # Preview first
scripts/auto-commit.ps1 -Scope "auth"           # Commit
```

The script analyses changed files, generates a conventional commit message, and stages+commits.

**Conventional commit format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Rules:**
- One logical change per commit
- Description: imperative mood, lowercase, max 72 chars
- Scope: the module/area affected
- Footer: `BREAKING CHANGE:`, `Closes #123`, `Co-authored-by:`

### Step 3: Prepare for PR

```powershell
# Interactive rebase (squash WIP commits)
git rebase -i main

# Generate PR body from commit history
scripts/pr-body.ps1 -Clipboard
```

The PR body script:
1. Detects base branch
2. Extracts commits since fork
3. Groups by conventional commit type
4. Generates ## Summary, ## Changes, ## Testing sections
5. Copies to clipboard

**Squash rules:**
- Squash `fixup!` and `wip` commits
- Keep meaningful commit history
- Never squash if commits have different scopes
- Use `git rebase -i main` with `fixup` (f) for WIP commits

### Step 4: Create PR

```powershell
# Create PR with generated body
gh pr create --title "feat(auth): add user authentication" --body "$(Get-Clipboard)"

# Or use the file
gh pr create --title "feat(auth): add user authentication" --body-file .pr-body.md
```

**PR guidelines:**
| Aspect | Rule |
|--------|------|
| Size | Max 400 lines changed |
| Title | Same as conventional commit |
| Description | What + Why + How to test |
| Reviewers | 1-2 relevant team members |
| Labels | Type (feat/fix/docs) + priority |
| Draft | Use for Work-in-Progress |

### Step 5: Clean up after merge

```powershell
scripts/cleanup-branches.ps1
```

This lists merged branches (excluding protected ones), asks for confirmation, deletes locally and remotely, and prunes remote tracking refs.

## Workflow by strategy

See [references/git-workflows.md](references/git-workflows.md) for full reference.

| Strategy | Best for | Branch model | Pros | Cons | Guidance |
|----------|----------|--------------|------|------|----------|
| **Trunk-based** | CI/CD, deploys multiple times/day, feature flags | Short-lived feature branches → main (hours, not days) | Fast integration, no merge hell, simple CI | Requires feature flags + high test coverage | Keep branches under 24h. Use branch by abstraction for large changes. |
| **GitHub Flow** | Standard SaaS, team of 2-10 | feature → main (PR + squash merge) | Simple, review-friendly, clean history | Can't manage multiple releases | Use for most projects. Squash-merge keeps main linear. Tag releases from main. |
| **GitFlow** | Release management, multiple supported versions, regulated industries | feature → develop → release → main + hotfix branches | Full version tracking, parallel releases | High complexity, slow to release | Only use if you support 2+ release versions simultaneously. Overkill for single-version SaaS. |
| **GitLab Flow** | Environment-based deployments, staging → production gating | feature → main → staging → production (branch per env) | Environment isolation, easy rollback | Duplicate merge overhead per env | Use when environments need different merge cadences. Pair with CI/CD environment protection. |

**Default recommendation**: GitHub Flow for simplicity. Trunk-based if CI/CD is mature and deploying multiple times/day.

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Cause | Fix |
|----------|-------|-----|
| Rebase conflicts | Multiple people changed same lines | Resolve conflicts, `git rebase --continue`. See conflict resolution workflow below. |
| Can't push (non-fast-forward) | Branch behind base | Rebase on base first |
| Accidental commit on wrong branch | Careless checkout | Cherry-pick to correct branch, reset original |
| Detached HEAD | Accidentally checked out a commit | `git switch -c <new-branch>` |
| Lost commits after reset | `git reset --hard` | `git reflog` → find SHA → `git cherry-pick` |

## Rebase conflict resolution

```
# During rebase, conflict arises
git status                          # See conflicted files
# Edit conflicted files → resolve markers (<<<<<<, ======, >>>>>>)
git add <resolved-files>
git rebase --continue               # Move to next commit

# If the rebase is going poorly and you want to bail:
git rebase --abort                  # Return to pre-rebase state

# If you're mid-rebase, unsure, and want to compare:
git diff                            # Show conflict diff
git mergetool                       # Launch configured merge tool (VS Code: code --wait $MERGED)

# Skip a problematic commit entirely:
git rebase --skip

# After rebase, verify history:
git log --oneline --graph -20
```

**Conflict avoidance:**
- Keep branches short-lived (< 3 days). Longer branches accumulate merge debt.
- Pull/rebase daily from main during long features: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main`
- Break large features into stacked PRs (PR 1 → PR 2 → PR 3) instead of one 1000-line PR
- Communicate: if you're refactoring a shared module, tell the team

## Parallel work with git worktree

Use `git worktree` to work on multiple branches simultaneously without stashing or cloning:

```powershell
# Create a new worktree for a feature
git worktree add ../project-feat-auth feat/add-user-auth

# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove a worktree after branch is merged
git worktree remove ../project-feat-auth
# Then delete the branch normally
```

**When to use:**
- Hotfix needs to go out while you're mid-feature on another branch
- Running CI/lint/tests in one worktree while coding in another
- Reviewing a PR branch without switching away from your current work
- Exploring an old commit without detaching HEAD

## Branch Protection Rules

| Rule | GitHub setting | Why |
|------|---------------|-----|
| Require PR before merge | `required_pull_request_reviews` | Prevents direct pushes |
| Require status checks | `required_status_checks` | CI must pass |
| Require linear history | `required_linear_history` | No merge commits |
| Require signed commits | `required_signatures` | Verify authorship |
| Dismiss stale reviews | `dismiss_stale_reviews` | New pushes need re-review |

## Production Checklist

- [ ] Branch named with conventional prefix
- [ ] Commit message follows conventional commits
- [ ] One logical change per commit

- [ ] PR under 400 lines changed
- [ ] CI passes (lint, typecheck, tests)
- [ ] At least 1 reviewer approved
- [ ] Branch deleted after merge
- [ ] No WIP commits in history

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Fix |
|-------------|-----|
| `git commit -m "fix bug"` | Conventional commit with context |
| 1000+ line PRs | Break into smaller, atomic changes |
| Merging main into feature branch | Rebase instead (cleaner history) |
| Committing directly to main | Branch + PR + review always |
| No CI before merge | Block merging without passing checks |
| Pushing to main without PR | Use branch protection rules |
| Stale branches (older than 2 weeks) | Clean up regularly |
