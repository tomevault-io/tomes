name: gh-ai-review-triage
description: Triage and optionally address AI-generated GitHub PR review feedback from Copilot, CodeRabbit, or similar bots. Use when the user asks to check AI review comments, decide whether comments require action, ignore non-actionable suggestions, fix required/should-fix/worth-fixing feedback, or summarize bot review findings on a pull request. Use when this capability is needed.

# GitHub AI Review Triage

## Goal

Separate AI review noise from useful feedback. Inspect review threads, classify each comment, fix comments that are required, should be addressed, or are clearly worth addressing, and leave optional/nitpick comments alone unless the user asks to address them.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the target PR.
   - Use a PR number or URL from the user when provided.
   - Otherwise infer the PR from the current branch and repository.
   - Prefer thread-aware data over flat comments when available, because resolution and outdated state matter.

2. Collect review context.
   - Fetch inline review threads with resolved/outdated state.
   - Fetch top-level PR comments and review submissions to catch bot summaries, approvals, and nitpick-only reviews.
   - Note the author for each item. Treat Copilot, CodeRabbit, and similar bot comments as advisory until verified.

3. Use the best available retrieval method.
   - If GitHub connector tools are available, prefer `_list_pull_request_review_threads` for inline threads and `_fetch_pr_comments` for the merged PR timeline.
   - If the GitHub MCP server is available, use `get_pull_request_comments` and `get_pull_request_reviews` as a fallback; note that flat comments may not fully preserve thread resolution state.
   - If only `gh` is available, use `gh pr view` to resolve the PR, then `gh api graphql` for `reviewThreads` and REST endpoints for `/pulls/{number}/comments`, `/pulls/{number}/reviews`, and `/issues/{number}/comments`.
   - If `gh` auth or network access fails, report the blocker and ask for re-authentication or permission instead of guessing from incomplete data.

4. Classify each comment.
   - `Required`: correctness bug, build failure, clippy/lint warning that reproduces, test failure, security/soundness issue, or behavior that conflicts with the user request. Note: a comment may only be classified `Required` after verification (see Step 5); if verification is not feasible, classify as `Should Fix` with a 'needs verification' tag instead.
   - `Should Fix`: non-blocking but clearly correct feedback that removes misleading code, unrealistic tests, stale comments, fragile behavior, or likely reviewer follow-up.
   - `Worth Fixing`: small low-risk change that improves clarity, test realism, performance in a hot path, user-visible behavior, or future maintainability.
   - `Optional`: nitpick, style preference, docstring/coverage suggestion outside project requirements, or UX improvement with fallback already implemented.
   - `Ignore`: outdated, resolved, duplicate, incorrect after local verification, or unrelated to this PR.

5. Verify before editing.
   - Reproduce claimed CI-impacting issues locally when feasible.
   - Inspect the referenced code, not only the bot wording.
   - If a bot says "warnings-as-errors" or similar, run the relevant check before treating it as required.
   - Only mark Required if the issue is verifiable with reproduction/test evidence or deterministically verifiable from available data; if verification isn't possible, downgrade to Should Fix with a 'needs verification' tag (or Ignore if clearly stale/duplicate).

6. Decide action.
   - Treat `Required`, `Should Fix`, and `Worth Fixing` as fix targets by default. Note: fix targets assume verification feasibility has been assessed per Step 5.
   - If the user explicitly says "必須だけ" or "only required", implement only `Required` items and report the skipped `Should Fix` / `Worth Fixing` items.
   - Do not address `Optional` or `Ignore` items unless the user explicitly asks.
   - Do not post replies, resolve threads, or submit reviews on GitHub unless the user explicitly requests that write action.

7. Implement and validate when changes are needed.
   - Keep fixes narrowly scoped to the review comment.
   - Run the smallest relevant tests/checks first, then broader checks if the fix touches shared behavior.
   - Commit/push only when the user asks for that.

## Output Format

When only triaging, summarize in Japanese if the user is using Japanese:

```text
確認しました。修正対象は N 件です。

- Required: ...
- Should Fix: ...
- Worth Fixing: ...
- Optional/Ignore: ...

対応する/しない理由:
...
```

When changes are made, include:

- which comments were addressed
- which comments were intentionally ignored and why
- validation commands and results
- whether GitHub replies/resolution were left untouched

## Heuristics

- AI approvals and bot overview comments usually do not require code changes.
- CodeRabbit "Nitpick" sections are optional by default, but promote them to `Worth Fixing` when the change is clearly safe and improves the PR directly.
- "Consider ..." wording is usually optional unless it points to a real bug, misleading test/comment, measurable hot-path issue, or low-risk improvement with clear value.
- A stale or incorrect bot claim should be called out briefly and left unchanged.
- For Rust PRs, local `cargo clippy` success is stronger evidence than an AI claim about unused imports.
