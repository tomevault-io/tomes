# Boilerplate

Generate minimal project scaffolds from short descriptions. Turn "CLI in Go with cobra" or "React app with auth" into a runnable structure with the right files and commands.

## When to Use

- User wants to start a new project from a description
- User asks for a scaffold, boilerplate, or starter
- User says "create a X that does Y" and expects a project layout

## Workflow

1. **Parse request**: Language, framework, key features (auth, DB, API, CLI)
2. **Choose stack**: Specific tools (e.g. cobra for Go CLI, Vite+React for frontend)
3. **Design layout**: Directories, main entry, config, README
4. **Generate**: Minimal files to run (main, config, one example)
5. Ask for clarifications, personalisation if needed

## Scaffold Rules

1. **Minimal**: Only what's needed to run and one clear path (e.g. one command, one route).
2. **Conventional**: Standard layout (e.g. cmd/ for Go, src/ for TS/JS).
3. **Runnable**: User can install deps and run with 1–2 commands.
4. **Documented**: README with install, run, and (if applicable) env vars.

## README for Scaffolds

```markdown
# [Project Name]

[One-line description]

## Setup

\`\`\`bash
[install deps: npm install, go mod download, etc.]
\`\`\`

## Run

\`\`\`bash
[npm run dev, go run ., etc.]
\`\`\`

## [Optional: Env / Config]
```

## What to Generate

- **Always**: Entry point, dependency file (package.json, go.mod, Cargo.toml, etc.), README
- **When relevant**: Config (e.g. .env.example), one test, .gitignore
- **Avoid**: Full app logic; keep to minimal “hello world” or one feature

## Ambiguity

If the request is vague:

- Pick one reasonable stack and say what you chose: "Using Vite + React; say if you want Next.js instead."
- Default to TypeScript for Node/React unless they say "JavaScript".

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Huge template with many options; keep it small
- ❌ Unrunnable (missing deps, wrong paths)
- ❌ No README or run instructions
- ❌ Over-engineered (e.g. full DDD for a tiny CLI)
