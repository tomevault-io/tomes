# Code Review

Review code against structured checklists for correctness, security, performance, and maintainability. Give actionable, prioritized feedback.

## When to Use

- User asks for a code review, PR review, or feedback on code
- User wants to check code quality, security, or style before merging
- User is auditing a file or module

## Workflow

1. **Understand context**: What is the change for? (issue, feature, refactor)
2. **Read the diff**: What actually changed?
3. **Collect all issues—never stop at first error**: Review the entire scope and return every issue you find. Do not stop when you hit the first bug or suggestion. Use manage_todos, a scratch file, or spawn_subagent (for large PRs) to track issues as you go, then output the complete list.
4. **Gather usage context**: Before judging changes in isolation, gather enough context to give complete feedback:
   - **Surrounding code**: Read the function/module containing the change, not just the modified lines. What invariants, preconditions, or patterns exist?
   - **Call sites & usage**: How is this code called? Search for callers, imports, or usages. Are there edge cases or misuse patterns at call sites?
   - **Integration points**: Does this touch APIs, DBs, external services, or shared state? How does it fit into the larger flow?
   - **Tests**: If tests exist for this area, read them to understand expected behavior and coverage gaps.
5. **Run checklist**: Logic, security, performance, style, tests (using the gathered context)
6. **Consider language & framework best practices**: Does the code follow idiomatic patterns for the stack?
7. **Prioritize**: Critical → must fix; Suggestion → consider; Nice-to-have → optional
8. **Respond**: Summary + categorized comments + concrete suggestions + what was done well

## Using git_diff Efficiently

The `git_diff` tool truncates large diffs (default 500 lines). For PRs with many files or 1k+ lines of changes:

1. **Get the file list first**: Call `git_diff` with `commit` (e.g. `main...HEAD`) and `nameOnly: true`. You receive `paths` — the full list of changed files.
2. **Fetch content by batch**:
   - **Small PR** (few files, under ~500 lines total): Call `git_diff` with just `commit` for the full diff.
   - **Large PR**: Call `git_diff` with `commit` and `paths` set to 5–10 files per batch (e.g. `paths: ["src/foo.ts", "src/bar.ts"]`). Use `maxLines: 2000` if batches are large. Iterate until you've reviewed all files.
3. **Prioritize**: Review highest-risk areas first (auth, input handling, external calls). Security-sensitive files warrant extra attention.

Don't assume a single `git_diff` call shows everything. If the result says `truncated` or you only see a few files, use the batched workflow above.

## Review Checklist

### Correctness & Logic
- [ ] Does it do what it claims? Edge cases?
- [ ] Off-by-one, null/undefined, empty inputs?
- [ ] Error handling: failures caught and handled?
- [ ] Concurrency: races, deadlocks, shared state?

### Security
- [ ] User input validated and sanitized?
- [ ] No secrets in code or logs?
- [ ] Auth/authz checked where needed?
- [ ] Dangerous functions (eval, exec, SQL concatenation) avoided?

### Performance
- [ ] Obvious inefficiency? (e.g. loop in loop when avoidable)
- [ ] Large data: streaming, pagination, or limits?
- [ ] Caching or repeated work that could be reused?

### Maintainability
- [ ] Naming clear? Functions do one thing?
- [ ] Duplication that could be factored?
- [ ] Magic numbers/strings that should be constants?
- [ ] Comments only where needed (why, not what)?

### Tests
- [ ] New behavior covered by tests?
- [ ] Tests readable and stable (no flake)?
- [ ] Mocks/fixtures appropriate?

### Style & Conventions
- [ ] Matches project style (lint, formatter)?
- [ ] Imports organized? Dead code removed?

## Feedback Format

Use a consistent severity and format:

```markdown
## Code Review: [PR/File name]

### Summary
[1-2 sentences: overall assessment and main concerns]

### Well done
- [Highlight specific things done very well—clear naming, solid error handling, idiomatic patterns, etc.]
- [Recognize good use of language/framework features.]

### Critical (must address)
- **[Location]** [Issue]. [Suggestion or fix.]
- ...

### Suggestions (consider)
- **[Location]** [Issue]. [Optional improvement.]
- ...

### Nice to have
- [Minor polish or future improvement.]
```

**Location**: file path, function name, or "line N" (if line numbers available). Be specific so the author can jump to it.

**Suggestion**: Prefer concrete fix (code snippet or exact change) over vague "consider improving X."

## Tone

- Respectful and constructive
- Assume good intent; explain the "why" behind requests
- Distinguish "this is wrong" vs "this could be clearer"
- No nitpicking without value; batch trivial style nits

## What Not to Do

- Don't skip the "Well done" section—acknowledging good work motivates and reinforces best practices
- Don't demand personal style preferences unless they're project convention
- Don't repeat what the diff already shows ("you added a function")
- Don't leave only "LGTM" without at least a one-line summary
- Don't mix severity: critical items must be clearly marked

## Small vs Large PRs

- **Small**: Full checklist, quick pass. One round of feedback.
- **Large**: Summarize by area (e.g. "Auth logic", "UI components"). Call out highest-risk areas first. Suggest splitting if it would help.

## Security-Sensitive Areas

Extra scrutiny for:
- Auth (login, sessions, permissions)
- Input handling (forms, API params, file upload)
- External calls (HTTP, DB, shell)
- Crypto and secrets

For these, explicitly note: "No issues found" or list concrete concerns.

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Reviewing the diff in isolation without checking surrounding code or call sites—context-free feedback is often incomplete or wrong
- ❌ Vague feedback ("this could be better")
- ❌ Only praising without actionable items when issues exist
- ❌ Blocking on style nits that aren't in the style guide
- ❌ Missing the main bug or security issue while commenting on formatting
