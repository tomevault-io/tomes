## Mindset & Thinking Patterns

### The Jazz Developer Mindset

When building features for Jazz, think like a **product engineer** who understands both the technical implementation and the user's workflow needs. Your goal is to create tools that feel magical to use while being rock-solid reliable.

**🎯 Think User-First:**

- **What problem am I solving?** - Always start with the user's pain point
- **How does this fit into their workflow?** - Consider the broader context
- **What happens when things go wrong?** - Plan for graceful failure
- **How can this be made simpler?** - Reduce cognitive load

**🧠 Think Agentically:**

- **Autonomous Decision Making**: Agents should make smart choices without constant supervision
- **Context Awareness**: Agents should understand their environment and user preferences
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Agents should learn and improve from interactions
- **Tool Orchestration**: Agents should seamlessly combine multiple tools and services

**⚡ Think Functionally:**

- **Composability**: Every function should be a building block for larger workflows
- **Immutability**: State changes should be explicit and traceable
- **Error Handling**: Every operation should have a clear failure mode and recovery path
- **Testing**: Every feature should be testable in isolation and integration

### Research-Driven Development

**🔬 AI/ML Research First:**

- **Use Exploration Docs**: Reference [docs/exploration/](../docs/exploration/) for research-inspired patterns (verification-refinement pipelines, agent skills, token-efficient formats, etc.)
- **Apply Research Patterns**: When implementing features, consider research-backed approaches
- **Experiment Boldly**: Don't be afraid to implement cutting-edge patterns from the exploration docs (speculative execution, agent skills, verification-refinement, etc.)
- **Measure Everything**: Benchmark improvements, track metrics, validate hypotheses when implementing research-inspired features
- **Think Research-Inspired**: When designing new features, consider how research patterns (multi-model consensus, semantic search, agent orchestration) could apply
- **R&D Mindset**: Treat every feature as an opportunity to push boundaries using patterns from the exploration docs

### Innovation Over Compatibility

**🚀 Break Things to Make Them Better:**

- **Don't Fear Breaking Changes**: If a better solution requires breaking the API, do it. We prioritize excellence over backward compatibility
- **NEVER Keep Deprecated Code**: When renaming or restructuring, update all usages immediately and remove old code. No `@deprecated` aliases, no backward compatibility shims. Clean breaks only.
- **Think Multiple Solutions**: Always consider 3-5 different approaches before implementing. Choose the best one, even if it's more disruptive
- **Question Assumptions**: Challenge existing patterns. Is Effect-TS the right choice? Could we use a different architecture? What if we redesigned from scratch?
- **Go Beyond Current Design**: Use the current codebase as a reference, but don't be constrained by it. If you see a better way, implement it
- **Evolutionary Architecture**: The codebase should evolve continuously. Refactor aggressively, redesign when needed, optimize relentlessly

**Implementation Philosophy:**

1. **Research First**: Understand the problem deeply, explore, study similar systems
2. **Design Multiple Solutions**: Brainstorm 3-5 different approaches, each with trade-offs
3. **Choose the Best**: Pick the solution that's best long-term, not the easiest short-term
4. **Implement Boldly**: Don't hold back. If it requires breaking changes, make them immediately and update all affected code
5. **Measure & Iterate**: Track metrics, gather feedback, refine continuously

## Behavior & Standards

### Development Mindset

- **Ask Clarification Questions**: Implement solutions with minimum ambiguity
- **Think User Workflow**: Consider how features fit into daily routines
- **Consider Agent Perspective**: How would an AI agent use this feature?
- **Plan for Edge Cases**: Identify all possible failure points from the beginning
- **Design for Extensibility**: Make features customizable and extensible
- **Research Before Building**: Check [docs/exploration/](../docs/exploration/) for patterns, study similar systems, understand the problem deeply
- **Think Multiple Solutions**: Always consider 3-5 alternatives, choose the best one
- **Break When Needed**: Don't hesitate to make breaking changes if they lead to better solutions

### 🔒 Security

- **Security-First Design**: Every feature must consider security implications from day one
- **Input Validation**: All external inputs validated using Schema, sanitized, and validated again
- **Credential Management**: Use secure storage, never log secrets, encrypt sensitive data
- **Audit Trails**: Log all security-sensitive operations with full context
- **Threat Modeling**: Consider attack vectors, injection risks, privilege escalation
- **Regular Audits**: Review security practices, update dependencies, patch vulnerabilities
- **Zero Trust**: Assume nothing is safe, validate everything, require explicit approval for dangerous operations

### 📖 Documentation

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Every public API, every feature, every pattern must be documented
- **Document Everything**: Code, APIs, decisions, trade-offs, future ideas
- **Clear Examples**: Provide real-world examples, not just API references
- **Keep It Updated**: Documentation must evolve with code. Outdated docs are worse than no docs
- **Multiple Formats**: Code comments, JSDoc, README files, architecture docs, user guides
- **Accessibility**: Documentation should be discoverable, searchable, and easy to navigate
- **Error Documentation**: Document all error scenarios, recovery strategies, and troubleshooting steps

### 🧪 Testing

- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests
- **Property-Based Testing**: Use Effect's testing patterns for robust validation
- **Error Scenarios**: Test all failure modes, edge cases, and error recovery
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark critical paths, track regressions
- **Security Tests**: Test input validation, credential handling, permission checks

### ⚡ Performance

- **Measure Everything**: Profile code, track metrics, identify bottlenecks, optimize continuously
- **Optimize Aggressively**: Cache expensive operations, parallelize where possible, lazy evaluation
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup, memory management, connection pooling
- **Cost Optimization**: Minimize LLM calls, use efficient formats, smart routing

## Core Technologies

- **TypeScript**: 100% TypeScript codebase, strict mode enabled
- **Effect-TS**: Primary library for functional programming, error handling, and async operations
- **CLI Framework**: Use a robust CLI library (Commander.js recommended with Effect integration)
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment

## Code Style & Best Practices

### Function Declarations

- **ALWAYS** use function declarations instead of arrow functions for top-level functions
- Use arrow functions only for callbacks, array methods, and inline operations
- Prefer named functions for better stack traces and debugging

### TypeScript Standards

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes
- Use discriminated unions for variant types
- Always specify return types for public functions
- Use `readonly` arrays and objects where appropriate
- Leverage Template Literal Types for string validation
- Never use `any` outside of test files

### Effect-TS Patterns

- Wrap all side effects in Effect
- Use Effect.gen for async workflows (Effect's equivalent of async/await)
- Implement proper error handling with tagged errors
- Use Effect.Layer for dependency injection
- Leverage Schema for runtime validation
- Use Effect.Ref for mutable state management

### CLI Architecture

- Structure CLI commands hierarchically: `jazz agent <action>`
- Each command should be a separate module
- Use Effect.Layer for CLI dependencies (config, logging, etc.)
- Implement proper help text and validation
- Support both interactive and programmatic usage

### Error Handling

- Create specific error types using Data.TaggedError
- Provide actionable error messages
- Use Effect's built-in error recovery mechanisms
- Log errors appropriately without exposing sensitive data

### Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for classes, interfaces, types, and enums
- Use camelCase for functions, variables, and methods
- Use SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Use kebab-case for CLI command names
- Prefix interfaces with 'I' only when distinguishing from implementation classes

### Async Operations

- Always use Effect.gen instead of async/await
- Chain operations using pipe() for better composition
- Use Effect.all for parallel operations
- Implement proper timeout and retry logic
