# Migrate a kit to v3

A v2 kit is one `spec.yaml` plus a `Dockerfile` that builds a named image. A v3
kit is one OCI image: the descriptor declares what the kit needs as typed
capabilities and rides in a manifest annotation, the image config carries the
runtime contract (entrypoint, env, user, workdir), and the layers carry the
content.

## Tooling

Three published tools, nothing repo-local:

- **`docker buildx`** builds kits. Nothing to install for the kit frontend —
  BuildKit pulls `docker/sandbox-kit:3` from the descriptor's `# syntax=` line.
- **`sbx`** runs them. Install the stable CLI from
  [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/install/) /
  [sbx-releases](https://github.com/docker/sbx-releases); current releases
  support Kits v3 in local and cloud mode.
- **`kit-tck`** judges conformance:
  `go install github.com/docker/sandbox-kit-spec/v3/cmd/kit-tck@latest`, or take
  an archive from the
  [releases page](https://github.com/docker/sandbox-kit-spec/releases). (A
  `go install` of an untagged ref reports `dev`; `@v3.x.y` and the release
  archives both carry the real version, which `internal/version` reads from
  the build info.)

  **This repository is private, so both routes need access to it.** The public
  module proxy cannot serve it — `proxy.golang.org` answers 404 — so `go
  install` resolves direct and needs a git credential plus
  `GOPRIVATE=github.com/docker/*`. In CI that means a token with read access,
  and a fork's token does not have one: a fork can still validate a descriptor
  by building it, since the frontend validates during the build, but it cannot
  run `kit-tck`. If the repository becomes public, that whole constraint
  disappears.

## Authorities

In precedence order:

1. [`spec/`](https://github.com/docker/sandbox-kit-spec/tree/main/spec) — the Go
   implementation. Where docs and code disagree, code wins.
2. [SPEC-v3.md](https://github.com/docker/sandbox-kit-spec/blob/main/docs/spec/SPEC-v3.md)
   — the grammar (§3 authoring forms, §4 top-level fields, §5
   provides/requires, §6 args, §7 capabilities, §8 launch modes).
3. [capability pages](https://github.com/docker/sandbox-kit-spec/tree/main/docs/spec/capabilities/com.docker.sandbox)
   — one per capability type, normative for its config schema and runtime
   behavior.
4. [examples](https://github.com/docker/sandbox-kit-spec/tree/main/examples) —
   worked kits. `claude` and `claude-mixin` are the migration of a real v2 kit
   into both shapes; read them first.

Working inside the spec repo, all four are also on disk at `spec/`,
`docs/spec/` and `examples/`.

## Workflow

Track progress with this checklist:

```text
- [ ] 1. Read the v2 kit end to end, including its README and testdata
- [ ] 2. Write the v3 descriptor, recipe, and context file
- [ ] 3. Add the -mixin variant (workload kits only)
- [ ] 4. Validate the descriptor (fails in seconds on a bad field)
- [ ] 5. Build the kit
- [ ] 6. Run it with sbx and exercise the agent
- [ ] 7. Verify with kit-tck
- [ ] 8. Publish, and delete the CI that published the v2 pair
```

### 1. Read the v2 kit first

Read `spec.yaml`, `Dockerfile`, `README.md` and `testdata/tck.yaml` before
writing anything. v2 kits carry their reasoning in comments, and that prose is
the most valuable thing to carry across. `testdata/tck.yaml` is the only record
of whether a working non-interactive invocation was ever established
(`promptArgs`), which decides whether the migrated kit declares
`agent-sessions@1`. It says nothing about interactive verbs: declare
`agent-interactive-sessions@1` beside it only for verbs you have verified
against the tool's real CLI, never from a pattern.

### 2. Write the v3 files

For a kit named `<kit>`, migrating in place:

| v2 | v3 |
|---|---|
| `<kit>/spec.yaml` | `<kit>/<kit>.yaml`, first line `# syntax=docker/sandbox-kit:3` |
| `<kit>/Dockerfile` | `<kit>/<kit>.dockerfile` — found by filename stem, so no `dockerfile:` field |
| `agentInstructions.content` | `<kit>/<kit>-context.md`, referenced as `contentFile: ./<kit>-context.md` |
| `<kit>/testdata/tck.yaml` | delete — v2-only harness |
| `<kit>/.dockerignore` | **keep and audit.** BuildKit still applies it to a v3 kit's build context, so deleting it puts back whatever it was excluding — secrets and large generated files included. Drop only the entries that named v2 files. |
| `<kit>/<kit>_tck_test.go` | delete — it loads the v2 `spec.yaml` through `tck.NewSuiteFromDir(".")` and cannot compile once that file is gone |

The complete field-by-field mapping, the capability rules, and the gotcha list
are in [FIELD-MAPPING.md](FIELD-MAPPING.md). Read it before writing the
descriptor.

Migrate faithfully: preserve every declared host, credential, hook, volume,
port, env var and instruction, and keep base images verbatim. Where v3 cannot
express something, or where a v2 declaration turns out to be dead config, mark
it with an inline `# MIGRATION NOTE:` comment rather than dropping it silently
— the `claude` example shows the convention.

Faithful does not mean literal in one respect: a v2 install **hook** is often a
v2 limitation rather than a v3 requirement, because a v2 mixin had no way to
ship content. Decide per hook whether it becomes a layer — the rule, and the
five cases where a hook is still correct, are in
[FIELD-MAPPING.md](FIELD-MAPPING.md#lifecycle1).

### 3. Add the `-mixin` variant

Every workload kit gets a sibling `<kit>-mixin/` holding `<kit>-mixin.yaml`,
`<kit>-mixin.dockerfile` and a context file. Name that last one
`<kit>-context.md`, which is what six of the seven example mixins do — the
staged name only has to avoid `kit.yaml` and `kit.dockerfile`, so the `-mixin-`
infix buys nothing and the repository is already near-unanimous. The mixin
declares the
same credentials, network policy, volumes and hooks, minus what only the kit
that owns the environment can carry. See the
[mixin variants](FIELD-MAPPING.md#mixin-variants) section for the exact
subtractions and the overlay recipe patterns.

### 4. Validate the descriptor

The frontend decodes and validates the descriptor **before** it builds any
content, so an export-less build is the fast loop *while the descriptor is
wrong*:

```sh
cd <kit> && docker buildx build . -f <kit>.yaml --output type=cacheonly
```

A malformed descriptor fails in about a second, naming the offending field and
its line. Be clear about what `cacheonly` does, though: it suppresses the
**export**, not the build. Once the descriptor is valid the frontend goes on to
solve the whole recipe — downloads, installs and all — so this is fail-fast for
bad input rather than a validation-only step. Iterate here until it is
clean: a malformed descriptor still costs only the second it takes to
reject, even though a valid one costs the whole recipe.

Pass build-phase args by the **kit's** arg name, not the `buildArg` name the
recipe sees, and supply anything declared `required` or validation fails:

```sh
docker buildx build . -f <kit>.yaml --build-arg version=2.99.0 --output type=cacheonly
```

Because the recipe is solved too, a bad `FROM` or `COPY --from` surfaces here
rather than waiting for step 5 — you just do not get an image out of it.

### 5. Build the kit

Swap the export for `--load` to put an ordinary tagged image in the local
store:

```sh
docker buildx build . -f <kit>.yaml -t <kit>-kit:<tag> --load
```

`--load` is not optional on the `docker-container` driver, which is what
`buildx create` gives you: without an output the result stays in the builder's
cache and `docker run <kit>-kit:<tag>` reports no such image.

To judge the artifact with `kit-tck` without a registry, export an OCI layout
directory instead:

```sh
docker buildx build . -f <kit>.yaml -t <kit>-kit:<tag> \
  --output type=oci,dest=/tmp/<kit>-layout,tar=false
```

A workload's recipe must build on a base carrying the platform floor — `bash`,
the `agent` user (uid 1000), `git`, a CA store — which the hardened
`dhi.io/sbx-templates:*` images carry. A bare distro base builds fine and
fails at agent launch.

### 6. Run it with sbx

Point `sbx` at the kit directory — the runtime builds source-form kits on
demand, keyed by source hash, so this needs no registry and no push:

```sh
sbx run ./<kit> .                            # a workload kit
sbx run ./<workload> --kit ./<kit>-mixin .   # a mixin, composed onto a workload
```

A mixin cannot run alone; compose it onto the migrated workload or onto a shell
workload. Pass kit args with `--kit-arg name=value` (or `--kit-arg
kit.name=value` to target one kit), and bind a credential the kit declares with
`sbx secret set <service>` before expecting authenticated calls to work. (The
`-g` flag older docs show is deprecated; global is the default now.)

Inside the sandbox, the kit is self-describing — use it to check that what you
declared is what arrived:

```sh
cat /usr/share/sandbox/kit/<kit>/kit.yaml        # the published descriptor
cat /usr/share/sandbox/kit/<kit>/kit.dockerfile  # the recipe that built it
cat /var/log/sbx-kit-startup.log                 # startup hook output
```

Then exercise the kit for real: run the agent's own version command, confirm
install hooks left what they should, confirm a declared volume is writable by
`agent`, and confirm an undeclared host is refused while a declared one is not.

`sbx kit inspect ./<kit>` builds the source kit and prints its resolved
declarations (kind, network counts, credentials, args) without starting a
sandbox. Add `--kit-arg` to preview how args resolve. The first source build
creates the shared builder sandbox and is slow; `sbx kit builder status` shows
it and `sbx kit builder rm` reclaims the cache.

For the published path instead of the local loop, push the kit as an ordinary
image and run it by reference — a kit image that only exists in the local
Docker store cannot run, because the runtime resolves kit images from
registries:

```sh
docker buildx build . -f <kit>.yaml --push -t docker.io/<you>/sbx-kit-<kit>:<tag> \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --provenance=true
sbx run docker.io/<you>/sbx-kit-<kit>:<tag> .
```

### 7. Verify with kit-tck

`kit-tck` judges an artifact's annotations, layers, staged sources and image
config, with every check linked to the clause it enforces. The same checks run
inside the frontend during a build, so running them here is how an artifact
changed by an exporter or a registry on its way out gets judged — and how a kit
this frontend did not build gets judged at all.

```sh
kit-tck validate --layout /tmp/<kit>-layout <tag>     # the OCI layout from step 5
kit-tck validate docker.io/<you>/sbx-kit-<kit>:<tag>  # a published kit
```

For the layout form, `<tag>` is the tag **alone** as the layout records it
(`1.0.0`), not the full `<kit>-kit:1.0.0` reference the build was tagged with.

Add `--verbose` to list the checks that passed, `--format json` for every check
with its spec link, and `--plain-http` for a registry served over HTTP.

A published kit built on a **multi-node** builder warns that the index carries
no kit annotations. That is expected, not a defect: a multi-node build merges
per-node results into a fresh index client-side, which dissolves them, and
§9.3 requires consumers to fall back to the platform manifest, which does carry
them. The verdict is still `✓ conforms`. A single-node build shows no warning.

Runtime conformance is a separate suite, for people implementing a runtime
rather than authoring a kit: `kit-tck runtime --adapter <path>` drives hundreds
of sandbox lifecycles against an adapter implementing
[conformance.md](https://github.com/docker/sandbox-kit-spec/blob/main/docs/spec/conformance.md).
It runs long — the bare command defaults `--timeout` to 30m and fails when that
expires, so a real run needs something like `--timeout 2h` — and migrating a kit
does not need it at all.

### 8. Publish

One artifact means one push. A v2 kit pointed `sandbox.image` at an image
published separately from the kit itself, so shipping a change meant building
and pushing both and keeping the reference between them honest. In v3 the
recipe's `FROM` builds the content, the frontend annotates it, and the result
in the registry is the whole kit:

```sh
docker buildx build . -f <kit>.yaml --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --push \
  -t <registry>/sbx-kit-<kit>:<version> -t <registry>/sbx-kit-<kit>:latest
```

**Audit the CI that published the v2 pair.** A pipeline built around two
artifacts does not fail once there is only one — it keeps pushing an image
nothing references now that `sandbox.image` is gone, and the step that packed
the kit has nothing left to pack. Both halves get deleted, not rewired.

**Check what the existing tag actually names.** A repo publishing a family of
kits into one repository tags them by *name* (`…/sbx-kits:<kit>`), which is a
tag that says nothing about which build it points at. Carried into v3 unchanged
and paired with a descriptor that never set `version:`, it yields a published
kit with no version anywhere in it. Add `<kit>-<version>` beside the bare name,
and set `version:` regardless — the joined tag is not version-shaped, so it
cannot stand in for the field.

Signing is optional, unchanged by the migration, and described with the rest
of the publish flow in
[create-kit-v3](../create-kit-v3/SKILL.md#publish).

## What actually catches bugs

Each check below caught real defects in a migration of 87 kits that the
cheaper checks above it did not. They are ordered by what they cost.

1. **Validation** catches malformed descriptors, and the **build** catches more
   than you would guess: `readContextFile` and `RequireAuthoredProvides` both
   run before the content loop, so a `contentFile:` naming a missing file and
   an authored `deb/` provide fail in step 4, not later. What neither sees is a
   `*-context.md` no descriptor references, or a v2 instruction body that was
   dropped — both fail at nothing at all. Script those two file-level audits;
   they take seconds and they found a kit whose instructions would silently
   never have reached the agent.
2. **Building** catches recipes. It does not prove the content works.
3. **Reading the exported layer** catches ownership, in **two** parts. Export
   with `--output type=oci,dest=<dir>,tar=false` and run
   `kit-tck validate --layout <dir> <tag>`: `overlay-home-ownership` fails an
   overlay whose `/home` is not root's or whose `/home/agent` is not uid
   1000's, which is what six of the migrated overlays got wrong. Then count
   every other owner:
   `for b in <dir>/blobs/sha256/*; do tar --numeric-owner -tvf "$b"; done | awk '{print ($2 ~ /\//) ? $2 : $3"/"$4}' | sort | uniq -c`.
   Every count must be `0/0` or `1000/1000`; that is what found four overlays
   shipping files owned by package publishers' uids. The awk reads GNU tar's
   joined `0/0` field or bsdtar's split pair, because a pipeline written for
   either silently reports the other's size and date.
4. **Composing the overlay and running the tool** catches the rest. Three
   mixins shipped dangling symlinks whose build-time `test -x` passed because
   the real tree was still present *in the build stage*: the installer had
   relocated a launcher but not its payload. `kit-tck`'s
   `overlay-links-resolve` now warns about those, but only the composition
   shows whether a link the overlay cannot resolve by itself finds its target
   on the base. Compose it through
   the assembler, which is what merges the overlay's `ENV` and `PATH` and puts
   it on a base carrying the platform floor:
   `sbx run ./<workload> --kit ./<kit> --detached --name t .`, then
   `sbx exec t tool --version`. Use `sbx exec` and not `sbx run … -- tool`:
   arguments after `--` are **agent** arguments and never run the binary. The
   `--load` plus throwaway `COPY --from=<overlay> / /` trick is faster and
   finds the same dangling symlinks, but it transfers files only — the image
   config is dropped, so a mixin relying on its own `ENV` fails there for a
   reason the assembler would not produce. Full detail in
   [Verifying an overlay](../create-kit-v3/RECIPES.md#verifying-an-overlay).
5. **`kit-tck`** judges the published artifact — see step 7.

When you change ownership, re-run step 4, not just step 3. A `chown` that fixes
the numbers can still break the tool.

## Known gaps

- `sbx kit validate` does not accept a v3 **source** kit: its load path has no
  kit builder configured. Validate with the build in step 4, and inspect the
  built artifact with `sbx kit inspect`.
- A migration strands every script, workflow and test that globs the old
  layout. Audit them as part of the work: discovery globbing `*/spec.yaml`
  returns nothing, so CI passes by building nothing at all, which is the worst
  failure mode available.

## Migration conventions

These are the conventions the `sbx-kits-contrib` v3 migration followed. Keep
them unless the task says otherwise:

- Migrate in place and delete the v2 `spec.yaml` and `Dockerfile` once the v3
  pair exists.
- Keep each kit's base images verbatim; a grammar migration is not the moment
  to re-point a base.
- Keep `README.md`, updating the filenames and any v2 grammar it quotes; keep
  `README.image.md`; delete `testdata/tck.yaml`. Keep `.dockerignore` — it
  still governs the v3 build context — and prune only the entries that named
  v2 files.
- Heavily commented YAML is the house style. Carry the v2 comments across —
  they are the reasoning behind the declarations.

## Coupled optional features

Use a `group` when skipping a capability also needs to skip its hooks,
files, or guidance. Put `optional: true` on the group, never on its
members (even `optional: false` is invalid). Groups are nonempty and
cannot nest; required and one-member groups are valid. See
`examples/optional-cache/optional-cache.yaml`.

The selection API includes every member or none, before composition.
A runtime supplies decisions on expanded entries; the API owns atomic
selection and ordering. Validate all member configs even in skipped
groups. Selected entries must still satisfy cross-entry rules, and a
composition conflict is an error rather than a reason to skip another
group. Singleton arity is per declaration block; lifecycle lists from
selected blocks concatenate, and duplicate file paths are errors.

Selection lasts for one sandbox installation, including restarts.
Recreation selects afresh. A failing selected hook is an execution
failure, not optional unavailability. Skipping a group does not remove
old files from reused volumes, omit image layers, or suppress argument
environment exports. Group names are display labels, not merge keys.

Groups extend the unfinished schema-3 grammar in place. Descriptors
using them require a reader implementing this extension; older strict
readers reject them.

## Final environment references

Use `${{ kit.env.HOME }}` in capability configuration strings when a path
depends on the final container environment. Image defaults compose first,
argument `env` exports replace them, and runtime environment overrides win
last. Expansion happens before validation and selection, including inside
groups. Missing names fail; empty values remain empty. This is structural
string substitution, not shell evaluation: `$HOME`, `${HOME}`, and `~/`
are unchanged. Do not use environment references in mapping keys or Kit
metadata, and do not pass Kit placeholders inside argument or environment
values. Persist the expanded descriptor for restart.
