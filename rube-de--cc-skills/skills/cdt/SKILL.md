description: Multi-agent development workflow using Agent Teams. Supports five modes: plan (architect teammate + PM teammate debate → plan.md), dev (developer teammate + code-tester teammate + qa-tester teammate + reviewer teammate iterate → code), full (plan → approval gate → dev), auto (plan → dev, no gate), and bugfix (tester + developer + reviewer TDD triad → fix + PR). Use when tasks benefit from collaborative agent teammates with peer messaging. Use when this capability is needed.

# Claude Dev Team

Multi-agent development workflow with five modes. Pick one based on the user's needs:

| Mode | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| **plan** | Need architecture/design before coding |
| **dev** | Have an approved plan, ready to implement |
| **full** | End-to-end with user approval gate between plan and dev |
| **auto** | End-to-end without approval gate |
| **bugfix** | Well-specified, reproducible bug (root cause may be unknown) — TDD fix cycle |

Before executing any mode, read the relevant workflow file:
- Feature modes (plan/dev/full/auto): [references/plan-workflow.md](references/plan-workflow.md) and [references/dev-workflow.md](references/dev-workflow.md)
- Bugfix mode: [references/bugfix-workflow.md](references/bugfix-workflow.md)

## Architecture

```

**Teammates** message each other directly (Architect teammate↔PM teammate, Developer teammate↔Code-tester teammate, Developer teammate↔QA-tester teammate, Developer teammate↔Reviewer teammate). In bugfix mode: Tester teammate↔Developer teammate, Reviewer teammate↔Developer teammate.
**Researcher** is a subagent — Lead relays results.

## Roles

### Researcher (subagent — spawn via Task without team_name)

Research specialist for doc lookups. Queries Context7 for library docs, searches web for best practices, returns structured findings with code examples. Bundled as `agents/researcher.md` in this plugin — Context7 MCP is auto-configured via `.mcp.json`.

### Tester (teammate — spawn via Teammate tool, bugfix phase)

Writes the failing regression test BEFORE the developer touches the code (TDD red phase). Verifies the fix passes and re-verifies after refactoring. Iterates directly with developer on failures (max 3 cycles for fix, max 2 for refactor).

### Architect (teammate — spawn via Teammate tool, plan phase)

Discovers codebase structure using the Explore agent (preferred) or repomix-explorer (if available) for broad understanding, then targets specific files with Glob/Grep/Read for detailed inspection. Reads existing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) from `docs/adrs/` before designing. Designs architecture: components, interfaces, file changes, data flow, testing strategy. Writes new ADRs to `docs/adrs/adr-NNNN-<slug>.md` for each significant decision. References existing ADRs when relevant and supersedes old ones when decisions change. Debates tradeoffs with PM teammate. Messages design to lead and PM teammate. Writes the plan file as their final deliverable.

### Product Manager (teammate — spawn via Teammate tool, plan phase)

Validates architecture against requirements. Challenges design with concerns. Produces verdict: APPROVED or NEEDS_REVISION with specifics.

### Developer (teammate — spawn via Teammate tool, dev phase and bugfix phase)

Implements tasks from plan (dev) or minimal fix from bug spec (bugfix). No stubs, no TODOs. Matches existing patterns. In dev mode: iterates with code-tester teammate on failures, qa-tester teammate on QA issues, reviewer teammate on code quality. In bugfix mode: iterates with tester teammate on failures and reviewer teammate on code quality. Updates project documentation (README.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md) to reflect implementation changes.

### Code-Tester (teammate — spawn via Teammate tool, dev phase, always)

Unit/integration tests. Messages developer teammate with failures + root cause. Max 3 cycles.

### QA-Tester (teammate — spawn via Teammate tool, dev phase, always)

Always spawned. Adapts testing approach based on task type: for UI tasks, writes Storybook stories and tests user flows via `npx agent-browser`; for non-UI tasks, runs integration/smoke tests, verifies regression safety, and tests API contracts. Messages developer teammate with issues + evidence. Max 3 cycles.

### Reviewer (teammate — spawn via Teammate tool, dev phase and bugfix phase)

Reviews changed files for completeness, correctness, security, quality, and plan adherence (dev) or bug spec adherence (bugfix). Validates review with `/council` (`quick quality` for routine, `review security` or `review architecture` for critical concerns). Scans for stubs. Messages developer teammate with file:line + fix suggestions. Max 3 cycles. Messages lead with verdict, review cycles, issues found/fixed, and known limitations after approval.

## Rules

- One team at a time — cleanup plan-team before starting dev-team
- Teammates debate directly (Architect teammate↔PM teammate, Developer teammate↔Code-tester teammate, Developer teammate↔QA-tester teammate, Developer teammate↔Reviewer teammate)
- Researcher is always a subagent — Lead relays results
- Plan.md is the single source of truth and handoff artifact
- Every task declares `type` (impl|test|docs) and `depends_on`; parallel within waves, sequential between
- Verify build between waves
- Avoid file conflicts between parallel tasks
- Testing + review are mandatory quality gates
- Always cleanup team before finishing
- In dev/full/auto modes, use delegate mode (Shift+Tab) to keep the lead focused on coordination
- Plan mode: do NOT implement — only plan
- If stuck — ask user, don't loop

## Lead Identity

You are a **coordinator**, not an implementer. During active team phases:

### NEVER do these — always delegate instead
- Edit or write source code files (`*.ts`, `*.js`, `*.py`, `*.go`, `*.rs`, `*.tsx`, `*.jsx`, `*.vue`, `*.svelte`, `*.css`, `*.scss`, `*.html`)
- Edit or write test files (`*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `__tests__/*`) — delegate to code-tester teammate (or tester teammate in bugfix mode)
- Edit or write project doc files (`*.md`) — delegate to the teammate with context (architect for plans/ADRs, reviewer for reports, developer for project docs)
- Run implementation commands (npm run build, cargo build, etc.) — teammates do this
- Fix code bugs directly — send bug details to the developer teammate
- Explore the codebase during planning (Explore agent, repomix-explorer, Glob/Grep/Read on source files) — delegate to architect teammate

### ALWAYS
- Delegate implementation to the developer teammate via SendMessage
- Delegate testing to code-tester and qa-tester teammates via SendMessage
- Delegate code review to the reviewer teammate via SendMessage
- Relay researcher subagent findings to teammates via SendMessage

### ALLOWED to do directly
- Git operations: commit, push, branch, PR creation
