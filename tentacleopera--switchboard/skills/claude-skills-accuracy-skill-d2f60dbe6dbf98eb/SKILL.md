# Accuracy — Solo High-Accuracy Mode

> This workflow trades tokens for correctness. It's designed for contexts where usage is free or low-cost, so the strategy is: **invest heavily in context-gathering and planning, verify at every gate, and red-team before finishing — to minimize rework rather than to save prompts.**

## File Creation Rules
- When creating files in `.switchboard/`, always use `IsArtifact: false` to prevent path validation errors.

## No-Artifact Rule
- `/accuracy` is a solo, in-conversation workflow. Do NOT write out artifacts to disk as part of execution — no `task.md`, no plan files, no Red Team Findings file, no progress logs. All progress tracking and review output belongs in your reply to the user; planning itself is internal (see Step 3) and is NOT presented as a plan-in-reply. The only files you create or modify are the actual code files required by the task itself.

## Quick Reference
- **Valid Actions**: None (solo workflow, no cross-agent delegation)

## Steps

1. **Start** — Activate accuracy mode via the `/accuracy` command. This workflow operates without MCP tool dependencies.

2. **Deep Context Gathering** (invest time here to avoid rework):
   - MUST read ALL files that will be modified or depend on changes.
   - MUST read existing tests, types, and interfaces related to the task.
   - MUST identify every dependency and side-effect BEFORE writing any code.
   - **WHY**: Missing context causes mistakes. Mistakes cause rework. Front-loading context is cheaper than fixing bugs later.
   - Mark Phase 1 complete in your reply (a brief checklist is fine) or via the Kanban UI if available. Do NOT create any tracking files on disk.

3. **Internal Planning** (think before you code, but do NOT present a plan-in-reply):
   - MUST map dependencies between changes internally — which must happen first?
   - MUST identify risks: what could break? What edge cases exist?
   - **DESTRUCTION CHECK**: If deleting files, MUST run `grep_search` to confirm nothing depends on them.
   - **RULE**: Spend more time thinking. A thought-through approach that prevents a rework cycle is worth far more than the tokens it costs.
   - Do NOT produce a plan-in-reply or present a plan for approval — proceed directly to Step 4 (implementation).
   - Do NOT write a plan file to disk — plan files are the domain of `/improve-plan`, not `/accuracy` (enforced by the No-Artifact Rule above).

4. **Implement in verified groups**:
   - Group related changes together — if 3 files need coordinated changes, do all 3 in one pass.
   - **HARD GATE after each group**: You MUST verify before moving to the next group:
     1. MUST call `run_command` with compile/lint/test command. Paste output.
     2. MUST read modified files back. Confirm changes are exactly as intended.
     3. If verification fails: fix immediately. If fix fails twice, **HALT** and notify user.
     4. NEVER proceed to the next group with a broken build.
   - Do as many groups as possible in a single pass — but NEVER skip the verification gate.
   - MUST track progress in your reply as you go: mark completed items `[x]` in an in-context checklist. Do NOT create or update any `task.md` (or other tracking) file on disk.

5. **Self-Review (Red Team)** — catch issues before they become rework:
   - Review ALL changes holistically as a hostile reviewer.
   - For each modified file, MUST check:
     - Does it handle edge cases (null, empty, boundary values)?
     - Are error paths covered?
     - Is it consistent with existing code style?
     - Could it break anything else in the codebase?
   - MUST list ≥3 concrete potential failure modes per modified file.
   - Document findings in your reply under a `### Red Team Findings` heading with specific line numbers. Do NOT write these findings to a file.
   - Fix all issues found — NEVER leave them for later.

6. **Final Verification & Complete**:
   - MUST run final compile/test across the whole project via `run_command`.
   - Review the complete diff for consistency.
   - Output: `**ACCURACY VERIFICATION COMPLETE**`
   - Mark Phase 5 complete in your reply. The workflow automatically terminates when all phases are done. Do NOT create or update any tracking file on disk.

## Final-Phase Recovery Rule
- Phase 5 is terminal for `accuracy`. Do NOT proceed to phase 6.
- If phase 5 succeeded but workflow state still appears active, use the Kanban UI to manually move the card to the appropriate column. Do NOT attempt to update kanban columns via SQL — transitions are system-managed.
