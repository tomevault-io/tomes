# Improve Plan

Use this workflow to strengthen an existing feature plan in a single fluid pass.

## Critical Constraints
- **NO IMPLEMENTATION**: You are strictly FORBIDDEN from modifying any project source files. Your ONLY permissible write action is updating the existing Feature Plan document.
- **CONTENT PRESERVATION (two-tier)**:
  - **Factual context — NEVER delete.** Goal statements, product scope, requirements, constraints, environment details, and problem/background analysis must be preserved verbatim. This includes product scope explicitly stated in the plan's Goal or Problem Description — you must not narrow or remove supported scenarios (e.g. multi-root workspaces) even if the current session is single-repo. If you believe a goal or scope statement is wrong, flag it in chat for the user — do not unilaterally correct it.
  - **Reasoning outputs — correct with audit marking.** Conclusions, chosen approaches, design decisions, and code examples may be corrected or replaced when the improve pass produces a better alternative. Every correction MUST be marked with a superseded callout so the change is auditable:
    > **Superseded:** <original conclusion or approach>
    > **Reason:** <why it was wrong or inferior>
    > **Replaced with:** <new conclusion or approach>

    Never silently delete a conclusion and write a new one in its place. The callout is the audit trail — without it, the change is a protocol violation.
- **SESSION vs PRODUCT SCOPE**: Session directives (e.g. "single-repo", "skip compilation", "skip tests") constrain HOW you verify and organize the plan, not WHAT the plan covers. Do not conflate repo structure constraints with product feature requirements. If the plan targets multi-root workspaces, you must preserve and improve that scope regardless of the current session's repo configuration.
- **SINGLE PASS**: Complete enhancement, dependency checks, the architecture challenge (Step 4), adversarial critique, balanced synthesis, and plan update in one continuous response.

## Target is a feature? Use improve-feature instead

If the target file is under `.switchboard/features/` or contains an auto-generated `<!-- BEGIN SUBTASKS ... -->` block, this is a **feature**, not a single plan. Stop and use the **`improve-feature`** workflow — it improves every subtask and is authorised to restructure the set (merge/delete/rewrite/split). This `improve-plan` workflow is for a single plan and is deliberately non-destructive, which is the wrong contract for a feature.

## Steps

1. **Load the plan**
   - Read the target plan file and treat it as the single source of truth.
   - Read the actual code for any services, utilities, or modules referenced by the plan.

2. **Assess scope — flag if split needed.** Before strengthening, check whether the plan covers 3+ distinct deliverables or 2+ independently-shippable phases. If so, surface that in chat and recommend splitting (write separate plan files for each deliverable/phase) or promoting to a feature via `create-feature-from-plans` — do not silently strengthen a mega-plan. This skill is single-plan and non-destructive, so it cannot retroactively split mid-improve; the recommendation is the action, the user decides. If the plan is genuinely single-scope, proceed to step 3.

3. **Improve the plan**
   - Fill in underspecified sections and break work into clear execution steps with file paths and line numbers.
   - Ensure the plan has ALL of the following sections (add any that are missing):

   **Required Sections (in order):**
   1. **## Goal** - 1-2 sentences summarizing the objective, followed by any core problem, background, or root-cause analysis (always preserve and do not drop existing analysis)
   2. **## Metadata**
      - **Tags:** [frontend, backend, auth, authentication, database, api, ui, ux, bugfix, feature, refactor, test, docs, security, performance, reliability, mobile, devops, infrastructure, cli, library]
      - Do NOT invent tags outside the allowed list. If no tags apply, write **Tags:** none
      - **Complexity:** 1-10
      - **Repo:** Bare sub-repo folder name if applicable
   3. **## User Review Required**

   ### Project Pinning
   When creating or updating a plan, include `**Project:** <name>` in the Metadata section if a project is active or the user named one. The workspace/repo name is NOT a project — never pin it (the importer silently drops workspace-name pins to unassigned). If no project is active and the user didn't name one, omit the line — never ask the user which project to use. See AGENTS.md "Plan Project Pinning" for the full protocol.

   4. **## Complexity Audit**
      - **### Routine** — bullet points or plain text listing routine aspects
      - **### Complex / Risky** — bullet points or plain text listing complex/risky aspects (or "- None" if empty)
      
      **Recommended format** (parser is flexible):
      ```markdown
      ## Complexity Audit

      ### Routine
      - [routine aspect 1]
      - [routine aspect 2]

      ### Complex / Risky
      - [complex aspect 1]
      - [or "- None" if no complex aspects]
      ```
   5. **## Edge-Case & Dependency Audit**
      - **Race Conditions**, **Security**, **Side Effects**, **Dependencies & Conflicts**
   6. **## Dependencies**
      - `sess_XXXXXXXXXXXXX — <topic>` format
   7. **## Adversarial Synthesis**
      - 2-3 sentence Risk Summary
   8. **## Proposed Changes**
      - ### [Target File]
        - Context, Logic, Implementation, Edge Cases
   9. **## Verification Plan**
      - ### Automated Tests

   **Complexity Criteria:**
   - **Routine (1-4):** Single-file, localized changes. Reuses existing patterns. Low risk. Small scope.
   - **Complex/Risky (7-10):** Multi-file coordination. New architectural patterns. Data consistency risks. Breaking changes.
   - **Mixed (5-6):** Majority routine but with one or two moderate, well-scoped risks extending existing patterns.
   - Do not add net-new product scope unless strictly implied by the existing plan.
   - You may add clarifying implementation detail only if strictly implied by existing requirements; label it as "Clarification", not a new requirement.

   **Scoring Guide:**
   - 1-2: Very Low — trivial config/copy changes
   - 3-4: Low — routine single-file changes
   - 5-6: Medium — multi-file changes, moderate logic
   - 7-8: High — new patterns, complex state, security-sensitive
   - 9-10: Very High — architectural changes, new framework integrations

4. **Challenge the approach (architecture review) — ALWAYS run; NEVER gate on complexity**

   Self-assessed complexity is unreliable: the most dangerous plans are the ones an agent *under*-scores ("this looks small"). So this step runs on **every** plan regardless of the Complexity score, and BEFORE the execution-level critique in the next step.

   Begin by answering in one line: **does this plan embody a real approach/design choice, or is it a purely mechanical change (typo, copy, config, single-call bugfix) with no design surface?**
   - If genuinely mechanical → write "No design choice — mechanical change" and proceed to Step 5. You must state this explicitly; you may NOT skip it silently. A wrong "this is mechanical" is exactly the failure this step exists to catch, so claim it only when there is truly nothing to decide.
   - Otherwise, challenge the approach the plan commits to:
     - **Name it.** State the plan's chosen approach in one sentence — the structure/pattern/mechanism, not the goal.
     - **Alternatives.** List 2–3 genuinely different approaches that could meet the same goal; one line of trade-off each.
     - **Justify or supersede.** Argue why the plan's approach is the best of the set — OR, if an alternative is clearly better, correct the plan's approach with a **Superseded** callout and flag it in chat. Do not stay inside the plan's frame just because it is the frame.
     - **Goal-vs-appearance probe (the load-bearing question):** does this approach actually *achieve the stated goal*, or only *appear* to? Name any way the plan could pass its own success check while the real goal is unmet — e.g. a completeness metric that counts scaffolding as "done"; an interface that abstracts a *call* without decoupling the *logic* behind it; a surface that is *reachable* but not *usable* (e.g. returns success but no data). If such a gap exists, it is a top finding — a green metric is NEVER a substitute for this judgment.
   - **Output:** write this architecture review to the chat response (like the Grumpy critique below), so the user can see the approach was actually challenged and veto it. It is separate from, and precedes, the execution-level adversarial review.

5. **Run the internal adversarial review**
    - First, produce a sharp Grumpy-style critique focused on assumptions, risks, race conditions, missing error handling, and validation gaps. Adopt a dramatic "Grumpy Architect" voice — incisive, specific, and theatrical. This voice is part of the planner's quality standard and must be preserved regardless of output-compression directives.
   - Immediately follow with a balanced synthesis that keeps valid concerns, rejects weak ones, and converges on the strongest execution strategy.
   - **Output:** Write the full Grumpy and Balanced critiques to the chat response as formatted markdown — do not only write them to the plan file. The user must be able to read the critique directly in chat without opening the plan. In the plan file's `## Adversarial Synthesis` section, include only a 2-3 sentence Risk Summary (e.g., "Key risks: X, Y, Z. Mitigations: A, B."). **Output the adversarial critique exactly once. Do not repeat it.**

6. **Update the original plan file**
   - Write the improvement findings back into the same feature plan file.
   - Preserve all factual context (goal statements, requirements, constraints, scope) per the CONTENT PRESERVATION rule. Correct superseded conclusions and approaches using superseded callout blocks — never silently delete.
   - Mark completed checklist items when appropriate.
   - End with a recommendation based on complexity:
     - If complexity is 1-3 → "Send to Intern"
     - If complexity is 4-6 → "Send to Coder"
     - If complexity is 7-10 → "Send to Lead Coder"

## Post-Review Board State

1. **Trigger Model**: This `improve-plan` workflow is triggered automatically when a card arrives in the "PLAN REVIEWED" column (which has `autobanEnabled: true` and `role: 'planner'`). The card is already in the "PLAN REVIEWED" column when this workflow runs. Do NOT instruct the user to move it there.
2. **Review Complete**: After completing the adversarial review and plan update, the card stays in the "PLAN REVIEWED" column. The activity light clears on the next plan-file edit. The user advances the card to the next pipeline stage (e.g. dispatches a coder) manually when ready.
3. **Plan Metadata**: Do NOT write a `**Plan ID:**` line — it is never parsed. The importer assigns the ID (a fresh UUID, or a feature's filename UUID) and keys plan identity by the file **path**; a hand-written Plan ID is ignored and drifts from the real DB-assigned one.
4. **Feature Relationships**: Feature relationships are carried by `**Feature:** <feature-plan-id>` and `**Project:** <name>` lines written directly in each plan `.md` — the plan watcher applies these on import with apply-if-empty semantics. If you restructured plans into a feature during review, recommend invoking the `create-feature-from-plans` skill (which runs `create-feature.js` to handle DB update, subtask linking, feature file write, and board refresh atomically) AFTER the review is finished and the user has approved. Do NOT invoke it mid-review.

## The Superseded Callout — Format Specification

**Placement:** Inline, at the location of the original conclusion being corrected.

**Format:**
```markdown
> **Superseded:** <original conclusion, approach, or code snippet>
> **Reason:** <concise explanation of why it was wrong or inferior>
> **Replaced with:** <new conclusion or approach>
```

**Rules:**
1. The `**Superseded:**` line must contain the original text (or a faithful summary if it was long). Do not paraphrase in a way that hides what was actually said.
2. The `**Reason:**` line is mandatory. A correction without a stated reason is a silent deletion with extra steps.
3. The `**Replaced with:**` line must immediately follow. If the replacement is long (e.g. a code block), it may continue below the callout.
4. Multiple corrections in the same plan are fine — each gets its own callout.
5. The callout replaces the original text in the document body. Do not leave the original text outside the callout AND inside it — that duplicates the contradiction.

**Example:**
```markdown
> **Superseded:** Use a polling loop with 500ms interval to detect file changes.
> **Reason:** Polling wastes CPU and introduces up to 500ms latency. The codebase already has a file watcher utility (`src/utils/watcher.ts`) that uses native FS events.
> **Replaced with:** Use `watchFileChanges()` from `src/utils/watcher.ts` — subscribes to native FS events, zero polling overhead, sub-10ms latency.
```
