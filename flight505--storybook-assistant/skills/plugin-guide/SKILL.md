# Plugin Guide & Help

## Overview

This skill helps users discover and understand all Storybook Assistant Plugin capabilities through natural language queries **that specifically mention the Storybook Assistant or Storybook plugin**.

## When to Use This Skill

**IMPORTANT:** This skill should ONLY trigger when the user explicitly mentions the plugin or Storybook-specific features.

**✅ DO Trigger on:**
- "What can the **Storybook Assistant** do?"
- "Show me **Storybook plugin** features"
- "Help with **Storybook Assistant**"
- "List **Storybook** commands"
- "**Storybook Assistant** capabilities"
- "What **Storybook** features are available?"
- "How do I use the **Storybook plugin**?"
- "Tell me about **Storybook Assistant**"

**❌ DO NOT Trigger on:**
- "help" (generic - goes to Claude Code help)
- "what can you do" (generic - not plugin-specific)
- "show features" (generic - could be anything)
- "list commands" (generic - could be any commands)
- General questions that don't mention Storybook or the plugin

## Response Strategy

**Getting started?** Try `/setup-storybook` first
**Have a screenshot?** Try `/design-to-code`
**Want more details?** Just ask about any specific feature!
```

### For Specific Feature Questions

When user asks about a specific capability:

**User:** "Can you help with accessibility?"
**Response:**
```markdown
# ♿ Accessibility Features

Yes! I have comprehensive AI-powered accessibility features:

## What I Can Do

1. **Automatic Detection**
   - Scans components for WCAG 2.2 violations
   - Real-time analysis via hooks
   - Covers 90% of common issues

2. **AI-Powered Fixes**
   - Context-aware suggestions (knows button purpose)
   - Ranked recommendations (Best → Good → Acceptable)
   - One-click application
   - Color contrast calculation

3. **Education**
   - Explains WHY each fix is needed
   - Teaches WCAG best practices
   - Links to relevant WCAG guidelines

## How to Use

**Quick fix for a component:**
```bash
/fix-accessibility Button.tsx
```

**Natural language:**
"Check my Card component for accessibility issues"
"Fix accessibility violations in the LoginForm"

## What Gets Checked

- Missing accessible names (buttons, links, images)
- Color contrast (WCAG AA/AAA)
- Keyboard navigation
- ARIA usage (semantic HTML first)
- Form labels
- Heading hierarchy

## Example Output

```
❌ Accessibility issue detected in Button.tsx:12

Issue: Button has no accessible name
WCAG: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
Impact: Screen reader users won't know button purpose

Recommended fixes:
1. Add visible text + icon (BEST) ⭐
2. Use aria-label (GOOD)
3. Use title attribute (ACCEPTABLE)

Apply fix? [1] [2] [3]
```

**Related Features:**
- `testing-suite` - Accessibility tests in Storybook
- `component-scaffold` - New components with a11y built-in

Try `/fix-accessibility [file]` or just ask me to check accessibility!
```

### For "How Do I..." Questions

Extract the task and provide step-by-step guidance:

**User:** "How do I set up visual regression testing?"
**Response:**
```markdown
# Setting Up Visual Regression Testing

Here's how to set up AI-powered visual regression testing:

## Quick Start (Automated)

Just run:
```bash
/setup-visual-testing
```

I'll automatically:
1. Detect your framework and build tool
2. Install dependencies (Playwright, test-runner)
3. Create configuration files
4. Capture baseline screenshots
5. Set up NPM scripts
6. Configure CI/CD integration (optional)

## Step-by-Step Process

**1. Run Setup Command**
```bash
/setup-visual-testing
```

**2. Choose Your Preferences**
I'll ask about:
- Integration with Chromatic/Percy (optional)
- Auto-approval rules (conservative/balanced/aggressive)
- CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab, etc.)

**3. Capture Baselines**
Initial screenshots will be captured automatically:
```
Capturing baseline screenshots...
  ✓ Button/Primary
  ✓ Card/Default
  ...
  ✓ Captured 47 stories
```

**4. Test Your Setup**
Make a small change and run:
```bash
npm run test:visual
```

**5. Review AI Analysis**
The AI will categorize changes:
- ✅ Expected (theme updates)
- ⚠️ Warning (review needed)
- ❌ Error (likely bugs)

## What Makes It "AI-Powered"?

Traditional visual regression:
- Flags thousands of anti-aliasing changes ❌
- Can't distinguish intentional from accidental ❌
- Requires manual review of everything ❌

AI-powered approach:
- Understands git history and design tokens ✅
- Auto-approves expected changes ✅
- Only flags real issues ✅
- 90% fewer false positives ✅

## Next Steps

After setup:
- Run `npm run test:visual` to test
- Use `npm run test:visual:interactive` for manual review
- Integrate with CI/CD to block regressions

Need more details? Type `/help visual-regression`
```

## Response Guidelines

### Keep It Scannable
- Use headers, bullets, and emoji

- Show examples, not just descriptions

### Be Conversational
- "I can help you..." not "This plugin can..."
- "Try `/command`" not "Use the command tool"
- Encourage questions: "Just ask me!"

### Provide Next Steps
- Always end with actionable next steps
- Suggest related features
- Point to detailed docs when appropriate

### Progressive Disclosure
- Start with high-level overview
- Provide details on request
- Link to full documentation

### Handle Edge Cases

**User:** "I'm completely lost"
**Response:** Start with `/setup-storybook` and offer to walk through step-by-step

**User:** "Too many features, overwhelming"
**Response:** Focus on the "Big 3" - design-to-code, accessibility, visual regression

**User:** "Which command should I use for X?"
**Response:** Suggest the most appropriate command with brief explanation

**User:** "Does this work with [framework]?"
**Response:** List supported frameworks and platform compatibility

## Integration Points

This skill should seamlessly hand off to:
- Specific skills when user wants to use a feature
- The `/help` command for detailed documentation
- Other skills for specialized tasks

## Files Structure

While this skill doesn't need supporting scripts, it should reference:
- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `SOTA_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Feature details
- `CLAUDE.md` - Development guidelines
- Individual `skills/*/SKILL.md` files - Feature documentation

## Summary

The plugin-guide skill makes the Storybook Assistant approachable and discoverable. It translates natural language queries into actionable guidance, helping users find the right features without needing to know exact command names or technical details.

**Key Benefit:** Users can explore capabilities conversationally - "What can you do?" - rather than reading documentation first.
