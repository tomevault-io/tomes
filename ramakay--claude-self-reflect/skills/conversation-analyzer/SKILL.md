# Conversation Analyzer Skill

You are a conversation analysis expert. Your task is to analyze Claude Code conversation JSONL files and extract meaningful problem-solution narratives that help developers find relevant past discussions.

## Input Format

You will receive conversation data as a JSONL file where each line is a JSON object representing a message with:
- `role`: "user" or "assistant"
- `content`: Message content (can be text, tool uses, or tool results)
- `type`: Message type
- Timestamp information

## Your Analysis Process

### Step 1: Extract Structured Data (Python)

Use the provided `extract_structured.py` script to parse the JSONL and extract:

1. **Messages timeline**: All user-assistant exchanges with timestamps
2. **Files touched**:
   - Files read (from Read tool uses)
   - Files edited (from Edit tool uses)
   - Files created (from Write tool uses)
3. **Tools used**: Count of each tool usage (Read, Edit, Write, Bash, etc.)
4. **Errors encountered**:
   - Error messages and their timestamps
   - Whether they were resolved (success in subsequent messages)
5. **Code blocks**: Presence and language of code snippets
6. **Timeline events**: Chronological list of key actions

### Step 2: Analyze the Narrative

Examine the structured data to understand:

1. **What was the user trying to accomplish?**
   - Initial request or problem statement
   - Context and constraints mentioned

2. **What solutions were attempted?**
   - Each distinct approach tried
   - Tools and files involved in each attempt
   - Outcome (success, failure, partial)

3. **What was learned?**
   - Errors that revealed insights
   - Successful patterns
   - Dead ends to avoid

4. **What was the final outcome?**
   - Was the problem solved?
   - What was the working solution?
   - Any remaining issues?

### Step 3: Generate Problem-Solution Narrative (Markdown)

Create a structured markdown document with this EXACT format:

```markdown
## Problem Statement
[One paragraph: What was the user trying to accomplish or fix?]

## Context
- **Project**: [Project path if identifiable]
- **Files involved**: [List 3-5 key files]
- **Starting state**: [What was broken/missing?]

## Timeline of Events
[Chronological list of key actions with timestamps - max 10 entries]

## Attempted Solutions

### Attempt 1: [Brief description]
**Approach**: [What was tried]
**Files modified**: [List files]
**Tools used**: [List tools]
**Outcome**: ✅ Success | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ Failed
**Learning**: [What was discovered]

[Include relevant code snippet if applicable]

### Attempt 2: [If applicable]
...

## Final Solution
**Implementation**:
```[language]
[Key code changes - only the essentials]
```

**Files Modified**:
- file.py (approximate line numbers if known)
- config.yml

**Verification**:
[How was success confirmed? Tests? Manual verification?]

## Outcome
✅ Success | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ Unresolved

[One paragraph summary of final state]

## Lessons Learned
1. [Key insight 1 - actionable]
2. [Key insight 2 - actionable]
3. [Key insight 3 - actionable]

## Keywords
[Comma-separated: technologies, concepts, patterns mentioned]
```

## Quality Guidelines

1. **Be concise but complete**: Include enough detail to understand the solution, but don't reproduce entire conversations
2. **Focus on the "why"**: Explain reasoning, not just actions
3. **Highlight failures**: Document what DIDN'T work - it's valuable knowledge
4. **Extract code carefully**: Only include code that illustrates the solution
5. **Use clear outcome indicators**: ✅ ⚠️ ❌ make scanning easy
6. **Write for search**: Include keywords naturally throughout the narrative

## Output Requirements

Your final output MUST be valid markdown following the exact structure above. This will be stored in a vector database for semantic search, so clarity and searchability are critical.

If the conversation doesn't follow a problem-solution pattern (e.g., pure Q&A, exploration), adapt the format but keep the core structure of:
- What was discussed
- Key points
- Outcomes/Learnings
- Keywords
