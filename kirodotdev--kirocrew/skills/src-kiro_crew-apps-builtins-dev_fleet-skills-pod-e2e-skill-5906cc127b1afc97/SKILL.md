# pod-e2e — test a worktree against an isolated full-stack pod

A worktree's full stack (backend API **and** frontend SPA) runs as **one process
on one port** — exactly like a Docker container. The `kirocrew pod` CLI is the
only interface you need: spin one up, get a `{base_url, token}` handle, test
against it, tear it down and have the teardown VERIFIED. The live gateway is
**never touched**.

## Quickstart — run the bundled e2e suite

```bash
bash <app-skills-dir>/pod-e2e/scripts/pod-e2e.sh <worktree-name> --video
```

**Expected success output** — a `POD-E2E SUMMARY` ending like:
```
  ✅ auth — GET /api/sessions → 200 with token, 403 without
  ✅ playwright — headless chromium loaded dashboard …
result:       2 passed, 0 failed
ARTIFACT_DIR=~/.kirocrew-pods/.e2e-artifacts/<worktree-name>
```
Exit code = number of failed phases (0 = all green). Then **look at the
evidence**: `Read` the screenshots in that `ARTIFACT_DIR`
(`fe-smoke.png`, plus any spec screenshots) to confirm the real UI rendered —
not a 403/blank page.

To smoke-test isolation after it finishes:
```bash
kirocrew pod ls          # should be empty (torn down)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://127.0.0.1:5476/api/sessions   # live plane still alive
```

## The interface — pod tools if you are an agent, the CLI if you are a human

**If you are an agent session, reach for the `pod_up` / `pod_down` / `pod_status`
/ `pod_ls` MCP tools before a shell.** A pod is a systemd `--user` unit, so every
pod verb needs the systemd user bus. Whether your shell can reach that bus depends
on the sandbox your session runs behind: under Kiro Crew's own sandbox it can (see
`security.md`, "Scoped user-bus locator forward"), but behind an outer sandbox with
its own user namespace it cannot, and `kirocrew pod up` then fails with
`Permission denied`. `systemctl --user is-system-running` tells you which case you
are in. The tools work either way -- the gateway holds the host bus and does the
systemd part -- so they are the portable choice, and the only one on a host that
denies you the bus.

```
pod_up     {"worktree": "<wt>"}   -> {name, base_url, token, port, ttl}
pod_status {"worktree": "<wt>"}   -> status + port + health
pod_ls     {}                     -> every pod active on this host
pod_down   {"worktree": "<wt>"}   -> stopped, HOME reclaimed
```

Provisioning is not one of them: a cold venv plus an SPA build is minutes of work,
and a single blocking tool call for that dies to any timeout with no way to learn
the outcome. An unbuilt worktree is refused with the CLI's own remedy in the
message; run `kirocrew pod provision <wt>` or use the Dev Fleet page's Provision
button, which streams its output.

Everything after step 1 below -- curl against the handle, drive the SPA with
Playwright, read the screenshots -- is unaffected: those are ordinary loopback
HTTP, which a sandbox does not block. Only the systemd control path is walled off.

The tools need the Dev Fleet app enabled; a disabled app refuses with
`app_not_enabled`.

The CLI is the same operations for a human at a terminal:

```bash
# 1. bring the pod up, get a handle (JSON: base_url + token + port)
kirocrew pod up <wt> --json
#    → {"name":"<wt>","status":"up","port":7958,
#       "base_url":"http://127.0.0.1:7958","token":"…","ttl":"2h"}

# 2. test against the handle — full stack, ONE port:
curl -s "$base_url/api/<anything>?token=$token"      # backend API
#    open  $base_url/?token=$token  in Playwright     # frontend SPA (same port)

# 3. destroy it — deletes the HOME and verifies it is gone (nonzero if not),
#    live gateway untouched
kirocrew pod down <wt>
```

Other verbs: `ls` (list running pods) · `status <wt>` · `token <wt>` · `url <wt>`
· `logs <wt>` · `provision <wt>`. Run `kirocrew pod --help` for the full list.
`token`, `url`, `logs` and `provision` have no tool of their own yet: `pod_up`
already returns the token and url, and pod logs stay a human-facing read.

**Isolation guarantees** (enforced by the pod runtime):
own `KIROCREW_HOME`, own port, **no tunnel** (can't grab the real Slack identity),
`--no-crons`, and cleanup on `pod down`.
A pod can **never** collide with the live gateway and many can run at once.

**Resource ceilings are Linux-only.** On Linux the unit sets cgroup
`MemoryMax=4G` / `CPUQuota=200%`, which the kernel enforces. **On macOS there is
no such ceiling and none is emitted** — macOS has no cgroups, and nothing it does
offer bounds the total memory of a *process tree* or hard-caps CPU (`RLIMIT_AS`
covers one process's address space, not resident memory, and the gateway spawns
agent subprocesses that each get their own limit). So on a Mac a runaway pod can
starve the machine; every other isolation property above still holds.

**Teardown belongs to `pod down`, on both platforms.** It stops the service,
waits for the process tree to drain, deletes the isolated HOME, and verifies the
directory is gone — a HOME that survives is reported as a failure, never as zero
residue. Nothing reclaims from a post-stop service hook: systemd would run one
before the final kill of the pod's cgroup (racing the pod's own subprocesses) and
on the stop half of a restart. So a pod that goes away WITHOUT a `down` (host
crash, force-reboot, a raw `systemctl --user stop`) leaves its HOME behind on
either OS; `pod ls` reports those (reclaim each with `pod down <name>`).

This is also what makes a **seeded** pod home survive `systemctl --user restart`
and `Restart=on-failure` instead of silently reverting to a blank instance.

## Bundled suite (quick path)

```bash
bash <app-skills-dir>/pod-e2e/scripts/pod-e2e.sh <worktree-name>
```

Runs the bundled orchestrator end-to-end. Prints a `POD-E2E SUMMARY` ending in
`ARTIFACT_DIR=<path>` and exits with the **number of failed phases** (0 = all
green). Flags:

| flag | effect |
|---|---|
| `--handle-json <path>` | run against a pod the CALLER started, from the handle in that file (see below) |
| `--keep` / `--no-stop` | leave the pod running after tests (debug) |
| `--api-only` | skip the Playwright phase (leaves a boot + auth check) |
| `--fe-only` | accepted no-op — no test-suite phase exists to skip |
| `--video` | record the session at 1080p → `.webm` + `.mp4` (finalization is time-capped) |

### Running the suite when you cannot reach the bus

The script drives the pod with `kirocrew pod` verbs, and those need the systemd
user bus, so on a host whose outer sandbox denies it the harness cannot start --
even though every phase after the first is ordinary loopback HTTP. `--handle-json`
is that path: boot the pod with the `pod_up` tool, then build the JSON object shown
below out of the values it reports and hand that file over. Do not paste the tool's
own reply into the file: it is labelled prose, and `json.load` rejects it with exit
64.

```bash
# pod_up {"worktree": "<wt>"} -> {"name": "<wt>", "base_url": ..., "token": ..., "port": ...}
# pod_status {"worktree": "<wt>"} -> health
# keep pod_up's name and write the fresh health code into that object, then:
bash <app-skills-dir>/pod-e2e/scripts/pod-e2e.sh <wt> --handle-json "$H/handle.json" --video
# ... and when you are done, pod_down {"worktree": "<wt>"}
```

The file is the object `pod_up` returns, including its own `name`, with the
`health` code `pod_status` reports added:

```json
{"name": "<wt>", "base_url": "http://127.0.0.1:7813", "token": "...", "port": 7813, "health": 200}
```

`name` must be a non-empty string exactly equal to the `<wt>` argument. The
harness refuses a missing, non-string, empty, or different name before any phase
runs; it never normalizes this field. Keep the value from `pod_up`'s own payload
rather than rebuilding it. `base_url` must be an HTTP loopback address carrying
an explicit port that is none of: the configured live-plane port
(`KIROCREW_POD_LIVE_PORT`), its default `5476`, and the reserved `7777`. The
default stays refused even when the variable names another port, because that
variable is read from the harness's own environment: a deployment that sets it only
in the gateway's unit would otherwise leave `5476` open here. Export it in the
shell that runs the harness so the configured port is refused too.
It and `token` may contain no whitespace or
control characters. `token`
must use the generated-token alphabet (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `-_.~+/=`), and
`port` must be a canonical decimal integer from 1 through 65535 that matches the
URL port. The harness validates these fields once, then runs from a canonical
payload: `base_url` is rebuilt as `http://<loopback-host>:<port>` with no path,
`port` is plain decimal, and the token is the validated value. No raw handle
field reaches the production-port refusal, curl configuration, or Playwright.
That is not shape pedantry: validating one representation and using another can
point the harness at the live plane. The `pod_up` producer already emits the
canonical URL, token, and port; add only the fresh `health` code from
`pod_status`.

In that mode the script calls no pod verb at all, and three things follow:

- **The pod is yours, not the harness's.** It is never stopped on exit, whether
  the run passes or crashes. Call `pod_down` yourself.
- **The health verdict is read, not measured.** The summary says
  `health — supplied by the caller`, and a stale handle means the run is judging a
  pod that has already died. Re-read it with `pod_status` immediately before the
  run, and pass what it reports rather than a remembered 200.
- **The lifecycle ran on the gateway's build, not the worktree's.** The CLI path
  deliberately pins the worktree's own `kirocrew` so `pod up` / `pod down`
  exercise the branch under test. Nothing pins the gateway. So for a diff that
  changes pod lifecycle code itself, the CLI path is the one that tests it -- a
  green handle-mode run says the branch's *gateway* boots and renders, not that
  the branch's *pod code* works.
- **`name` ties the handle to a worktree, not to a clone.** The check refuses a
  handle whose `name` is not the worktree you asked for, but a pod name is a
  worktree basename, and two clones on one host can each hold a worktree of that
  name. Run the harness from the clone whose pod you booted: with a handle from the
  other one, the specs and the artifact directory come from here while the requests
  go there, and the verdict is filed under the wrong checkout. Nothing in the
  handle, and nothing the pod serves, identifies a checkout today -- closing it
  needs `pod_up` to emit a machine-readable handle that carries one.

A missing or malformed handle is refused before any phase runs, naming the field
that is wrong.

**It does not run the worktree's test suite.** There is no pytest phase, on
purpose: the suite is ~62k tests that need no pod, CI runs it on the merge ref,
and a full local fan-out on a shared box costs far more than the browser check
this harness exists for. Run the tests your change actually touches yourself,
in the worktree (see the `kirocrew-worktree-dev` skill), and let CI own the
full suite.

## What each phase does

1. **up** — `kirocrew pod up <wt> --json`. If already active, reuses it (and
   won't stop it on exit). With `--handle-json` nothing is started at all: the
   handle IS this phase. Boots the worktree's own gateway with `--no-crons`,
   blank-seed DB, isolated HOME. If this phase fails with `gateway still
   starting after Ns` in `pod-up.log`, the gateway was alive but slower than
   the health-wait budget (default 90s): re-run with
   `KIROCREW_POD_HEALTH_SECS=<higher>` exported — the harness passes its
   environment through to the `pod up` it spawns.
2. **health** — polls `kirocrew pod status <wt> --json` until its `health` is
   200/401/403 (≤60s). Deliberately not a bare `curl base_url/api/health`: a
   derived port is routinely held by another pod or by the live gateway, every
   gateway answers that path identically, so a 200 there proves only that
   *something* is listening. `pod status` reports the pod's OWN health and returns
   `-2` when the responder is provably somebody else's, which this phase reports
   as a port conflict naming `PORT=`. On timeout it dumps logs to `boot-fail.log`
   and aborts.
3. **auth** — proves auth: `/api/sessions` → 200 with token, 403 without.
   Token comes from `kirocrew pod up --json` output (no manual minting needed).
4. **Playwright** — `pod-playwright.py` (run with a Playwright venv + bundled
   chromium) loads `/?token=` headless, asserts the SPA rendered (screenshots
   `fe-smoke.png`), then exec's the optional `PLAYWRIGHT_SPEC` with a live authed
   `page` in scope.
   - If the Playwright interpreter is not executable, the FE phase **skips
     gracefully** (no failure, just a warning).
   - `--video` requires `ffmpeg` for mp4 transcoding; if absent, the `.webm` is
     kept but no `.mp4` is produced.
   - **Bounded, always.** The whole phase runs under `timeout`
     (`POD_E2E_PW_TIMEOUT`, default 600s) and each browser-teardown step under
     its own cap (`POD_E2E_TEARDOWN_TIMEOUT`, default 30s). Video finalization
     (`context.close()`) has been observed to block forever *after* a spec
     passed; on expiry the driver keeps every artifact, kills the browser tree,
     and exits, and the summary reports `playwright — TIMED OUT` as a distinct
     outcome. A recording that grew past 200MB is reported and left
     un-transcoded — for a short spec that size is itself a defect signal.
     The per-step cap uses `SIGALRM`, so on a platform without it the teardown
     degrades to unbounded and says so in the log (the harness is POSIX-only
     anyway); the phase-level `timeout` still applies.
5. **collect** — all logs + screenshots land in
   `~/.kirocrew-pods/.e2e-artifacts/<wt>/`. Per-phase results are appended to
   `verdict.jsonl` **as they are decided** (and `playwright.log` is unbuffered),
   so a stalled or killed run still leaves a readable verdict. The file is
   truncated at the start of **every** run — including runs that skip the FE
   phase — so it can never show a previous run's rows. The rest of the artifact
   dir DOES persist across runs, so check timestamps before trusting an old
   screenshot.
6. **stop** — `kirocrew pod down <wt>`: stops the service, waits for its process
   tree to drain, deletes the isolated HOME, and verifies it is gone — a HOME that
   survives fails the command rather than being reported as zero residue. Skipped
   if `--keep` or if
   the pod was already up.

## The test manifest (`.pod-test.sh`)

Optional per-worktree file declaring how THIS feature is tested. Searched at
`<worktree>/.pod-test.sh` then `<worktree>/src/kiro_crew/.pod-test.sh`.
The manifest is parsed **declaratively** (a `PLAYWRIGHT_SPEC=` line is
extracted textually) — it is **never sourced or eval'd** on the host.

```sh
# .pod-test.sh
PLAYWRIGHT_SPEC=".pod-e2e/feature.spec.py" # frontend spec, relative to the manifest's dir
```

### Trust model

The **pod** isolates the gateway under test (own `KIROCREW_HOME`, own port,
no tunnel, resource caps). The **harness** is not a sandbox: it runs the
worktree's own gateway, and exec's that branch's `PLAYWRIGHT_SPEC`, as your
user — exactly like building and running the checkout yourself. Only run
pod-e2e against branches you would be willing to build and run locally.

### Playwright spec contract

A spec is plain Python exec'd with these names in scope (no imports needed):
`page` (already on the authed app), `context`, `base_url`, `token`,
`artifact_dir`, `expect` (Playwright's **native web-first assertion** —
`expect(locator).to_be_visible()`, auto-retries), `expect_true(cond, msg)`
(boolean fallback, raises `AssertionError`), and `record(name, ok, detail="")`
(append a per-assertion row to `verdict.jsonl` immediately, so a later stall
still leaves your decided results on disk — an `ok=False` row **fails the run**,
it is not a silent note). Assert UI, take screenshots into
`artifact_dir`. Run with `--video` to also record a `.webm` (+ a shareable
`.mp4`) at 1080p, paced.

### First-run noise is auto-suppressed

A fresh pod = a real first-run: every Playwright context starts with empty
`localStorage`, so onboarding/changelog modals would pop up and overlay the
feature you're testing. The runner handles this automatically:
- **pre-seeds** `localStorage` so theme modal never mounts;
- **dismisses** any modal that still appears by pressing Escape + clicking
  `[aria-label="Close"]` if present.

Pass `--no-suppress-first-run` to let those modals appear (only if testing the
onboarding flow itself).

## PRIMARY USE — dev agent delegates to a QA agent

When you (the agent building a feature) want it tested, spawn a *separate QA
agent* via `spawn_run` and hand it the worktree name. You keep coding; the QA
agent runs the isolated pod, inspects the evidence, triages failures, and reports
a verdict back as a completion event.

### The QA agent prompt (copy, fill `<wt>` + the feature one-liner)

```
spawn_run(task="""
You are a QA engineer verifying the KiroCrew feature in worktree '<wt>'.
Feature under test: <one-line description of what this branch adds>.

Run the isolated end-to-end suite (it spins a throwaway pod on its own port,
never touches the live instance, and tears it down after):

    bash <app-skills-dir>/pod-e2e/scripts/pod-e2e.sh <wt> --video

Rules:
- Do NOT `cat` any .local_secret yourself (credential-read blocked). The script
  mints the token internally via the CLI — just run the one command above.
- If that command dies with a `Permission denied` from systemd, your sandbox
  denies you the user bus. Do NOT hand-roll curl and Playwright in its place:
  boot the pod with the `pod_up` tool, build one JSON file holding its `name`,
  `base_url`, `token` and `port` plus the `health` from `pod_status`, re-run the
  same command with `--handle-json <file>`, and call `pod_down` when the verdict
  is written. Every one of those fields is required and `name` must equal `<wt>`,
  so a file missing one is refused with exit 64 before any phase runs.
- After it finishes, READ the artifacts in the printed ARTIFACT_DIR:
  verdict.jsonl (per-phase results, written as decided — trust this even if the
  run was killed), playwright.log, fe-*.png screenshots (use the
  Read tool on the .png to actually look at the UI), and boot-fail.log if present.

Then return a QA VERDICT, not a raw dump:
  1. Overall: PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED (couldn't even boot the pod).
  2. Per check (auth / playwright): pass|fail + one-line evidence.
  3. For each FAIL: triage it — is it (a) a real regression in the feature,
     (b) a flaky/timing issue, or (c) an environment problem (missing venv,
     missing dist, port clash)? Cite the log line or screenshot that proves it.
  4. The ARTIFACT_DIR path so the dev can open screenshots/video.
""")
```

### When to delegate vs run inline
- **Delegate to a QA agent** (default): you're mid-feature and want it verified
  without derailing your own context; or the suite is long (Playwright + video).
- **Run inline** yourself: a quick smoke where you want the result in your own turn.

Parallel QA across branches: spawn one QA agent per worktree in a single
`spawn_run` `tasks=[...]` call — each pod gets its own port and isolated HOME,
so they don't collide.

## Prerequisites & the provisioning on-ramp

A worktree must be **built** before it can be podded — its own
`.venv/bin/kirocrew` (editable install) + a built SPA bundle (`static/dist`).
The pod boot refuses without them.

```bash
kirocrew pod up <wt>                 # auto-builds the venv; FAILS LOUD if no dist
kirocrew pod up <wt> --provision     # full on-ramp: venv + build, then up
kirocrew pod provision <wt>          # just the on-ramp (venv + dist)
kirocrew pod provision <wt> --venv-only
```

Every failure teaches the next step: no worktree → create one; no venv → auto;
no dist → build-or-`--provision`.

- Playwright venv: controlled by env `KIROCREW_PW_PY`.
  If that interpreter is missing or not executable, the FE phase **fails** —
  it does not skip. A run that captured zero screenshots must never report a
  green summary. Set it up once, pinning the version that matches the chromium
  build already on disk:

  ```sh
  python3 -m venv <path> && <path>/bin/pip install playwright==1.61.0
  export KIROCREW_PW_PY=<path>/bin/python
  ```

  To skip the frontend phase deliberately, pass `--api-only` — that is the only
  clean skip.
- `--video` needs `ffmpeg` on PATH (or pointed to by `POD_E2E_FFMPEG` env).
  If absent, `.webm` is kept but no `.mp4` transcoding occurs. Recording
  finalization is time-capped (see `POD_E2E_TEARDOWN_TIMEOUT`), so `--video`
  can cost you the `.mp4` — never the verdict.

## Hands off the live plane

This skill only ever talks to pod ports (78xx). It must never restart or touch
the live gateway. If the derived port ever resolves to the production port the
orchestrator refuses and exits.

## Attach approved QA media to the PR (MANDATORY workflow)

QA screenshots and demo videos follow a **review-then-attach** contract:

1. **Deliver to the user first.** Send the screenshots/video for review (after
   the usual frame inspection for overlays -- first-run modals, toasts, theme
   pickers). Never attach media the user has not seen.
2. **Wait for explicit approval of the media.** A silent user is NOT approval.
3. **On approval, attach to the PR automatically -- do NOT ask again.** The media
   is a GitHub attachment, never a commit: nothing is copied into the worktree,
   nothing is amended, nothing is pushed.
   - Write the PR body to a scratch file outside the worktree and reference the
     approved files by their local paths: `![Settings page, empty state](<ARTIFACT_DIR>/fe-settings.png)`.
     Put the 2-3 most telling shots inline and fold the rest into `<details>`.
     A video MUST stand alone in its own paragraph -- `![](<ARTIFACT_DIR>/demo.mp4)`
     with a blank line above and below -- to render as an inline player; inside a
     sentence it renders as a link.
   - Run `gh pr edit <n> --body-file <body> --attach <ARTIFACT_DIR>/fe-settings.png --attach <ARTIFACT_DIR>/demo.mp4`
     (one `--attach` per file; gh >= 2.99, check `gh --version`). Each referenced
     path is rewritten in place to a permanent
     `https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/<uuid>` URL; an attached file the
     body does not reference is appended at the end. Limits: 10 MB per image/GIF,
     100 MB per video. `--attach` needs push access to the repository -- a fork
     contributor without it drags the file into the description in the web UI,
     which yields the same URL.
   - Verify the body update landed: `gh api repos/<o>/<r>/pulls/<n> --jq .body | grep -c user-attachments`
     prints the number of files you attached.
   - The URL is tied to no commit or branch, so a later amend, force-push, branch
     deletion or the merge leaves it valid; nothing is ever re-pinned.
4. **Attach before asking for PR approval.** The evidence goes in as a body edit
   -- no push, no approval reset -- and it must be in the body before the user is
   asked to approve the PR, so the approval covers what a reviewer sees.

### Keep the rest of the tree clean

The e2e suite already writes its logs and screenshots to
`~/.kirocrew-pods/.e2e-artifacts/<wt>/` -- **outside** the worktree -- by design;
don't copy those raw logs back into the worktree "to keep them with the branch."
No QA output belongs in the tree: approved media is uploaded from `ARTIFACT_DIR`
as a PR attachment (above), and everything else -- raw `*.log` dumps, extra
frames, scratch notes, the `.pr-body.md` you fed to `gh pr create` -- stays
outside (write it under a `mktemp -d`). Before ending the session,
`git status --porcelain` must be empty: a dirty tree fail-closes Dev Fleet's
"Prune merged" (`merged_dirty`) so the merged worktree can't be reaped. See the
kirocrew-worktree-dev skill, "Rule 9 -- Leave the worktree clean (so prune can
reap it)."
