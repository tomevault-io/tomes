# Cross-Source Research

Structured workflow for investigating topics across multiple MCP-connected sources. The goal is synthesis, not citation. Research is not complete until you can explain the topic conversationally, not just list where you found mentions of it.

## When to Activate

Trigger phrases: "research", "investigate", "what's the current state of", "pull context on", "what do we know about", "gather context on", "find out about".

## Research Depth Standards

These rules apply to every step below. They exist because the default AI research behavior is shallow: find a reference, summarize the title, move on. That is not research.

1. **Read the content, not just the metadata.** Open the page, read the body. Open the file, read the code. Open the thread, read the messages. A Confluence page title tells you nothing about the decision that was made inside it.
2. **Extract the "why", not just the "what."** If a feature was built, find out why. If a decision was made, find who made it and what they rejected.
3. **Trace outcomes.** If something was proposed, did it ship? If it shipped, is it still live? If it was deprecated, why? Follow the full lifecycle, not just the announcement.
4. **Look for contradictions.** Different sources often disagree. A Slack thread might say "we decided X" while a Jira ticket still tracks Y. Flag these.
5. **Stop when you can teach it.** If you can only say "I found 3 mentions of X in Slack and a Confluence page about it," you are not done. You are done when you can explain what X is, why it exists, what state it's in, and what should happen next.

## Step 1: Define the Question

Before searching anything, clarify:
- What specifically are we trying to understand?
- What would a good answer look like? (a timeline? a decision? a metric? a status?)
- What sources are most likely to have the answer?

Do not skip this step. Unfocused research produces unfocused results.

## Step 2: Check Local Knowledge First

Before hitting external tools, check what's already known:
- Project knowledge base (CLAUDE.md, docs/, any knowledge/ directories)
- Recent conversation history (was this discussed earlier in the session?)
- Task/todo files (is there already an open item tracking this?)

This avoids redundant searches and gives you baseline context to make external searches more targeted.

## Step 3: Search Across Sources

Use the Task tool to dispatch parallel searches where sources are independent. Common source types and what to look for:

| Source Type | What to Search For | MCP Tools |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Chat/messaging** (Slack, Teams) | Discussions, decisions, announcements, debates | Channel history, thread replies, search |
| **Documentation** (Confluence, Notion, Wiki) | PRDs, design docs, roadmaps, meeting notes, decision records | Page search, space listing, page content |
| **Issue tracking** (Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues) | Ticket status, blockers, engineering context, sprint progress | Issue search, issue details, epic contents |
| **Code** (GitHub, GitLab) | Implementations, PRs, code reviews, architectural decisions in comments | Code search, PR search, file contents |
| **Drive/docs** (Google Drive, SharePoint) | Decks, meeting transcripts, strategy docs, shared spreadsheets | File search, file content, folder listing |
| **Analytics** (databases, BI tools) | Quantitative evidence, metrics, usage data | SQL queries, saved reports |
| **Product analytics** (Pendo, Amplitude, Mixpanel) | Feature adoption, user behavior, survey responses | Usage queries, guide metrics, segments |

Not every source applies to every question. Pick the 2-4 most relevant sources, not all of them.

## Step 4: Read and Extract

For each result found in Step 3:

**Chat threads**: Read the full thread, not just the first message. Decisions often happen 15 messages deep. Note who said what and when.

**Documentation pages**: Read the body content, not just the title and last-modified date. Look for: stated goals, success criteria, status sections, inline comments, unresolved questions.

**Tickets/issues**: Check status, assignee, linked PRs, comments, and blockers. A ticket marked "In Progress" for 3 months is not the same as one created yesterday.

**Code**: Read the actual implementation, not just the PR title. Check test coverage. Read review comments for context on why choices were made.

**Data**: Run queries to validate claims. "We have high adoption" means nothing without a number. "Override rates are high" needs a percentage and a baseline.

## Step 5: Synthesize

Produce a structured summary. This is the deliverable. It should answer the original question from Step 1.

**Required sections:**

- **Key findings**: What do we now know? State facts, not opinions. Include specific numbers, dates, names.
- **Decisions found**: What was decided, by whom, and when? Link to the source.
- **Contradictions or gaps**: Where do sources disagree? What's still unknown?
- **Recommendations**: Based on the findings, what should happen next? Be specific. "Follow up with X about Y" is better than "more research needed."

**Quality check for synthesis:**
- Does it answer the original question directly?
- Could someone who wasn't in this session understand the findings?
- Are claims backed by specific sources (not "according to Slack" but "per [name] in #channel on [date]")?
- Are recommendations actionable (who, what, by when)?

## Step 6: Persist

Save findings so they're available in future sessions:
- Update relevant project knowledge files with new findings
- Add follow-up items to task lists
- If findings change the project's understanding of something, update CLAUDE.md or project docs

Research that isn't persisted will be re-done. Capture it once, reference it forever.
