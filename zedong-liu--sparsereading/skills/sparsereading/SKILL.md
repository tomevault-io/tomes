description: Use SparseRead for long documents, PDFs, and compact multi-file evidence closures without disrupting small native reads. Use when this capability is needed.

Use this skill only when a tool result, `sro_preview`, or the task shape indicates
SparseRead is useful. Keep ordinary native `read`, `grep`, and `exec` workflows
for small files, small config/code/data tasks, exact full-table computation, and
script-driven analysis.

SparseRead protocol:

1. Call `sro_preview(path)` on a large file, PDF/report, or compact evidence
   directory before broad native reading. Use the preview directly when enough.
2. Continue with `sro_read({ artifact_id }, mode, hint)` only when targeted
   evidence is needed. For multi-question documents and evidence closures,
   prefer `mode: "collect"` with explicit `slots`.
3. If `slot_digest.overall_status` is `ready` or `next_action.allowed_next`
   allows writing, write the requested deliverable. Do not keep broad-reading
   or repeating `sro_read` after ready.
4. Native small reads are still allowed for setup files, templates, unsupported
   objects, and named unresolved slots.
5. Use `sro_raw(raw_ref)` only when the original content is explicitly needed.
   `sro_card -> sro_read` remains for compatibility and `bench_protocol`, not as
   the normal production path.

OpenClaw gate profiles:

- `native`: do not push SparseRead.
- `advisory`: SparseRead may help, but native tools stay available.
- `enforce`: broad native read/search/exec-dump should use
  `sro_preview` first.

Command-security closures are advisory, not hard replacement. Use one
`sro_read(mode="collect")`; once ready, write the report/JSON immediately. Read
small templates or named unresolved files natively when needed.
