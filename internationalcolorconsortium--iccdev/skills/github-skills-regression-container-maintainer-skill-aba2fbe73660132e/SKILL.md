# Regression Container Maintainer

Use this skill for repeatable maintainer operations in
`ghcr.io/internationalcolorconsortium/iccdev-ci-regression`.

## Required Inputs

1. Operation: basic smoke, PR validation, or issue reproduction.
2. Image tag: `latest` for initial interactive work or an immutable SHA tag for
   reproducible validation.
3. PR, issue, branch, or commit reference.
4. Affected tool and smallest focused regression.
5. Expected pass and failure signals.
6. Host evidence directory.

## Workflow

1. Read `../../../docs/regression-container.md`.
2. Pull the image and record its digest and source revision. For `latest`, verify
   both values before using the image.
3. Mount only an evidence directory and start a disposable container.
4. Require a clean initial Git worktree.
5. For a PR, fetch `pull/<number>/head` and check out the ref detached.
6. For an issue, reproduce with existing project tools and saved inputs.
7. Rebuild the affected target, then run the focused regression and registered
   CTest wrapper.
8. For local PR proof, pull the published `latest` image, record its resolved
   digest, mount the reviewed worktree read-only, and copy it to container-local
   scratch space. Run the Docker PR verification build (the configured tool and
   test target set with strict Clang sanitizer flags), reject compiler warnings,
   and run CTest excluding only the `slow` and `calculator` labels.
9. When the PR-specific behavior is in an excluded suite, run its focused CTest
   wrapper in addition to the routine Docker PR envelope.
10. For AFL/CFL work, run `iccdev-fuzz-env`, record the patch-stack counts, and
    run the smallest matching smoke (`iccdev-afl-smoke.sh --patches` or
    `cfl/build.sh --patches`) before broader validation.
11. Run broader CTest or GCC 15.2 strict parity only after the focused check
    passes.
12. Scan logs for compiler warnings, ASAN, UBSAN, and signal termination.
13. Trigger `ci-pr-action.yml` explicitly for a pre-PR branch; a push alone does
    not trigger that workflow.
14. Compare all `Dockerfile*` files between `ci-qa-pr-docker-testing` and
    `ci-qa-flags`; carry every applicable container fix to both branches.
15. Confirm the `ci-qa-flags` branch update and hosted validation explicitly.
16. Promote the verified immutable digest to `latest` only after all image smoke
    tests and regression CTest checks succeed: automatically from `master`, or
    explicitly from the protected Docker-testing branch with
    `publish-regression-latest=true`. Never promote it from other branches.
17. Report exact image tag, digest, source revision, commands, results, evidence,
    and workflow URLs.

## Safety Gates

- Do not mount the Docker socket, SSH keys, or GitHub token into untrusted code.
- Do not use custom C++ reproducers.
- Do not use `git clean` to mask a dirty image.
- Exit `1-127` is graceful; exit `128+` is signal termination.
- Attribute sanitizer findings by stack-frame paths.
- Preserve evidence outside the disposable container.
