## First-Time Setup

If VoiceMode isn't working or MCP fails to connect, run:

```
/voicemode:install
```

After install, reconnect MCP: `/mcp` → select voicemode → "Reconnect" (or restart Claude Code).

---

# VoiceMode

Natural voice conversations with Claude Code using speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS).

**Note:** The Python package is `voice-mode` (hyphen), but the CLI command is `voicemode` (no hyphen).

## When to Use MCP vs CLI

| Task | Use | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| Voice conversations | MCP `voicemode:converse` | Faster - server already running |
| Service start/stop | MCP `voicemode:service` | Works within Claude Code |
| Installation | CLI `voice-mode-install` | One-time setup |
| Configuration | CLI `voicemode config` | Edit settings directly |
| Diagnostics | CLI `voicemode diag` | Administrative tasks |

## Usage

Use the `converse` MCP tool to speak to users and hear their responses:

```python
# Speak and listen for response (most common usage)
voicemode:converse("Hello! What would you like to work on?")

# Speak without waiting (for narration while working)
voicemode:converse("Searching the codebase now...", wait_for_response=False)
```

For most conversations, just pass your message - defaults handle everything else.
Use default converse tool parameters unless there's a good reason not to. Timing parameters (`listen_duration_max`, `listen_duration_min`) use smart defaults with silence detection - don't override unless the user requests it or you see a clear need. Defaults are configurable by the user via `~/.voicemode/voicemode.env`.

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `message` | required | Text to speak |
| `wait_for_response` | true | Listen after speaking |
| `voice` | auto | TTS voice |

For all parameters, see [Converse Parameters](../../docs/reference/converse-parameters.md).

## Best Practices

1. **Narrate without waiting** - Use `wait_for_response=False` when announcing actions
2. **One question at a time** - Don't bundle multiple questions in voice mode
3. **Check status first** - Verify services are running before starting conversations
4. **Let VoiceMode auto-select** - Don't hardcode providers unless user has preference
5. **First run is slow** - Model downloads happen on first start (2-5 min), then instant

## Parallel Tool Calls (Zero Dead Air)

When performing actions during a voice conversation, use parallel tool calls to eliminate dead air. Send the voice message and the action in the **same turn** so they execute concurrently.

### Pattern: Speak + Act in Parallel

```python
# FAST: One turn — voice and action fire simultaneously
# Turn 1: speak (fire-and-forget) + do the work (all parallel)
voicemode:converse("Checking that now.", wait_for_response=False)
bash("git status")
Agent(prompt="Research X", run_in_background=True)

# Turn 2: speak the results (with listening)
voicemode:converse("Here's what I found: ...", wait_for_response=True)
```

```python
# SLOW: Two turns — unnecessary sequential delay
# Turn 1: speak
voicemode:converse("Checking that now.", wait_for_response=False)
# Turn 2: do the work
bash("git status")
# Turn 3: speak results
voicemode:converse("Here's what I found: ...", wait_for_response=True)
```

### When to Use Parallel vs Sequential

| Scenario | Approach | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Announce + do work | **Parallel** | No dependency between speech and action |
| Announce + spawn agent | **Parallel** | Agent runs in background anyway |
| Check result then report | **Sequential** | Need result before speaking |
| Listen for response | **Sequential** | `wait_for_response=True` blocks until user finishes |

### Key Rules

- **All tool types can be parallel**: MCP, Bash, Agent, Read — mix freely in one turn
- **Wall-clock time = longest call**, not the sum of all calls
- **Use `wait_for_response=False`** for the speak call when combining with other tools
- **Great for demos**: Audience hears continuous speech with no awkward silences

## Handling Pauses and Wait Requests

When the user asks you to wait or give them time:

**Short pauses (up to 60 seconds):** If the user says something ending with "wait" (e.g., "hang on", "give me a sec", "wait"), VoiceMode automatically pauses for 60 seconds then resumes listening. This is built-in.

**Longer pauses (2+ minutes):** Use `bash sleep N` where N is seconds. For example, if the user says "give me 5 minutes":
```bash
sleep 300  # Wait 5 minutes
```
Then call converse again when the wait is over:
```python
voicemode:converse("Five minutes is up. Ready when you are.")
```

**Configuration:** The short pause duration is configurable via `VOICEMODE_WAIT_DURATION` (default: 60 seconds).

## STT Recovery - Manual Transcription

If Whisper STT fails but the audio was recorded successfully, you can manually transcribe the saved audio file:

```bash
# Transcribe the most recent recording
whisper-cli ~/.voicemode/audio/latest-STT.wav

# Or check if file exists first (safe for inclusion in automation)
if [ -f ~/.voicemode/audio/latest-STT.wav ]; then
  whisper-cli ~/.voicemode/audio/latest-STT.wav
fi
```

**Requirements:**
- Audio saving must be enabled via one of:
  - `VOICEMODE_SAVE_AUDIO=true` in `~/.voicemode/voicemode.env`
  - `VOICEMODE_SAVE_ALL=true` (saves all audio and transcriptions)
  - `VOICEMODE_DEBUG=true` (enables debug mode with audio saving)

**How it works:**
- VoiceMode saves all STT recordings to `~/.voicemode/audio/` with timestamps
- The `latest-STT.wav` symlink always points to the most recent recording
- If the STT API fails, the recording is still saved for manual recovery
- This lets you recover the user's speech without asking them to repeat

**When to use:**
- STT service timeout or connection failure
- Transcription returned empty but user definitely spoke
- Need to verify what was actually said vs. what was transcribed

## Voice Handoff Between Agents

Transfer voice conversations between Claude Code agents for multi-agent workflows.

**Use cases:**
- Personal assistant routing to project-specific foremen
- Foremen delegating to workers for focused tasks
- Returning control when work is complete

### Quick Reference

```python
# 1. Announce the transfer
voicemode:converse("Transferring you to a project agent.", wait_for_response=False)

# 2. Spawn with voice instructions (mechanism depends on your setup)
spawn_agent(path="/path", prompt="Load voicemode skill, use converse to greet user")

# 3. Go quiet - let new agent take over
```

**Hand-back:**
```python
voicemode:converse("Transferring you back to the assistant.", wait_for_response=False)
# Stop conversing, exit or go idle
```

### Key Principles

1. **Announce transfers**: Always tell the user before transferring
2. **One speaker**: Only one agent should use converse at a time
3. **Distinct voices**: Different voices make handoffs audible
4. **Provide context**: Tell receiving agent why user is being transferred

## Sharing Voice Services Over Tailscale

Expose local Whisper (STT) and Kokoro (TTS) to other devices on your Tailnet via HTTPS.

### Why

- Browsers require HTTPS for microphone access (e.g., VoiceMode Connect web app)
- Tailscale serve provides automatic HTTPS with valid Let's Encrypt certificates for `*.ts.net` domains
- Enables using your powerful local machine's GPU from any device on your Tailnet

### Setup

```bash
# Expose TTS (Kokoro on port 8880)
tailscale serve --bg --set-path /v1/audio/speech http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech

# Expose STT (Whisper on port 2022)
tailscale serve --bg --set-path /v1/audio/transcriptions http://localhost:2022/v1/audio/transcriptions

# Verify configuration
tailscale serve status

# Reset all serve config
tailscale serve reset
```

### Endpoints

After setup, endpoints are available at:
- **TTS:** `https://<hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net/v1/audio/speech`
- **STT:** `https://<hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net/v1/audio/transcriptions`

### Important Notes

- **Path mapping**: Tailscale strips the incoming path before forwarding, so you MUST include the full path in the target URL
- **Same-machine testing**: Traffic doesn't route through Tailscale locally — test from another Tailnet device
- **Multiple paths**: You can configure different paths to different backends on the same or different machines
- **CORS**: Kokoro has CORS configured to allow `https://app.voicemode.dev` origins

### Use with VoiceMode Connect

In the VoiceMode Connect web app settings (app.voicemode.dev/settings), set:
- **TTS Endpoint**: `https://<hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net`
- **STT Endpoint**: `https://<hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net`

## Soundfonts

Audio feedback tones that play during Claude Code tool use. Toggle with `voicemode soundfonts on/off`. See [Soundfonts Guide](../../docs/guides/soundfonts.md).
