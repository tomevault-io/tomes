# Adding a new interface language

The app bundles translations at build time. Adding a locale means touching three
code locations plus two prose locations. Miss any one and the failure is silent:
i18next falls back to English mid-screen, or the new locale ships with no
key-parity coverage.

Run all npm commands from `app/`.

Below, `{code}` is the ISO code (`it`) and `{Name}` is the language's own name
for itself (`Italiano`).

## 1. Create the translation file

```bash
mkdir -p app/src/locales/{code}
cp app/src/locales/en/translation.json app/src/locales/{code}/translation.json
```

## 2. Translate the values

Translate every value in `app/src/locales/{code}/translation.json`. Do not
change, add, or drop keys. The key-parity test in step 5 fails if the shape
drifts from `en`.

Labels must fit 320px (project rule in `AGENTS.project.md`), so prefer the
concise translation where two options exist.

## 3. Add the language name to every translation file

The `languages` section of each locale lists all languages, so the picker reads
correctly whatever language the UI is currently in. Add `"{code}": "{Name}"` to
the `languages` section of every `translation.json` under `app/src/locales/`,
the new one included. List them first rather than working from memory:

```bash
ls app/src/locales
```

Use the same string `{Name}` in all of them. Language names are not translated.

## 4. Register the locale

In `app/src/locales/resources.ts`, add the import alongside the others and the
entry in `LANGUAGE_RESOURCES`:

```typescript
import {code}Translation from './{code}/translation.json';
```

```typescript
export const LANGUAGE_RESOURCES = {
  // ...
  {code}: { translation: {code}Translation },
};
```

Both pickers and i18next read this map, so nothing else registers a locale.

## 5. Nothing to do for the pickers

Both of them, Settings → Appearance and the sidebar globe dropdown, render
`useLanguageOptions` (`app/src/hooks/useLanguageOptions.ts`), which reads the
codes registered in step 4 and orders them English first, then by label. The
order is covered by `app/src/components/layout/__tests__/LanguageSwitcher.test.tsx`,
which pins the expected sequence, so add the new code there.

## 6. Update the user doc

`docs/user-guide/settings.md`, Appearance table, Language row, names the
available languages in English. Add the new one.

## 7. Add the plural forms the language needs

English declares `_one` and `_other`. A language with more plural categories
needs the rest, or i18next finds no key for those counts and silently renders
English: Russian showed "2 monitors" until `_few` and `_many` were added. The
parity test checks every category `Intl.PluralRules` reports for counts up to
100, so it tells you which keys are missing.

```bash
node -e "console.log(new Intl.PluralRules('{code}').resolvedOptions().pluralCategories)"
```

## Nothing to do for dates, the assistant, or the parity test

These already take the active locale as data, so none of them needs a
per-locale entry:

- `app/src/lib/relative-time.ts` passes the code straight to
  `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat`.
- `app/src/lib/assistant/system-prompt.ts` interpolates the locale into the
  prompt and asks the model to answer in the user's language.
- `app/src/locales/__tests__/translation-keys.test.ts` discovers locale
  directories on disk, so the new one is key-checked against `en` with no edit.

## Verify

```bash
npm test
npx tsc -b
npm run build
npm run test:e2e -- settings.feature
```

`settings.feature` has a language-change scenario, so it is the relevant e2e
run for this change.

Then check the UI by hand: Settings → Appearance → Language, and the sidebar
globe dropdown. Both should list the new language, and selecting it should
change the visible text.

## Checklist

- [ ] `app/src/locales/{code}/translation.json` created and fully translated
- [ ] `languages.{code}` added to every translation file under `app/src/locales/`
- [ ] `app/src/i18n.ts` import and `resources` entry
- [ ] expected order updated in `LanguageSwitcher.test.tsx`
- [ ] plural forms for every category the language needs
- [ ] `docs/user-guide/settings.md` Language row
- [ ] `npm test`, `npx tsc -b`, `npm run build`, `npm run test:e2e -- settings.feature`
