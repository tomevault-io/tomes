description: This skill should be used when in planning/plan mode, or when the user wants to plan features, research implementations, or understand the codebase before generating specs. Use this for exploratory research and clarification before implementation. Use when this capability is needed.

# Planning Skill

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive planning workflows for features and system changes. It focuses on the **research and clarification phase** - gathering context, exploring architecture, and asking good questions before spec generation.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- **In planning/plan mode** (auto-trigger if possible)
- User says: "plan this", "research this feature", "help me understand"
- User asks: "what do I need to know before implementing X?"
- Before generating specs with `/cmd:generate-spec`
- Need to explore codebase patterns and architecture

## Core Workflow

### 1. Research Phase
- Explore codebase for similar existing features
- Identify which domain/area this belongs in
- Locate related types, schemas, services, routes
- Check test patterns in relevant areas
- Review database models (if applicable)
- Use `references/research-checklist.md` for systematic exploration

### 2. Context Gathering
- **Internal docs**: Check `.agent/docs/` for relevant patterns
- **CLAUDE.md**: Review project conventions and rules
- **context7 MCP** (if available): Fetch external library docs
  - Check for `mcp__context7__*` tools
  - Use for React, Fastify, Prisma, etc. documentation
  - Fall back to WebFetch/WebSearch if not available
- See `references/context-sources.md` for detailed guidance

### 3. Clarification (If Needed)
Ask clarifying questions ONE AT A TIME if implementation approach is unclear:
- **Don't use the Question tool**
- Use this template:
  ```md
  **Question**: [Your question]
  **Suggestions**:

  1. [Option 1] (recommended - why)
  2. [Option 2]
  3. Other - user specifies
  ```
- See `references/clarification-questions.md` for examples and templates

### 4. Complexity Assessment
- Estimate file count and scope
- Identify cross-cutting concerns
- Assess if new patterns needed or extending existing
- Determine context requirements for implementation
- Flag if complexity suggests breaking into smaller features
- See `references/complexity-assessment.md` for detailed rubric

### 5. Handoff to Spec Generation
Prepare clear summary for `/cmd:generate-spec`:
- What was found during research
- Existing patterns to follow
- Recommended architecture approach
- Initial complexity estimate
- Unresolved questions (if any)
- Suggest: "Ready to generate spec with `/cmd:generate-spec`?"

## Key Principles

### Do
- ✅ Research deeply - explore codebase thoroughly
- ✅ Ask questions conversationally (text-based, ONE AT A TIME)
- ✅ Document findings clearly
- ✅ Leverage context7 MCP when available for external docs
- ✅ Check `.agent/docs/` for internal patterns
- ✅ Provide architecture recommendations with rationale
- ✅ Prepare handoff context for spec generation

### Don't
- ❌ Use AskUserQuestion tool (breaks exploratory flow)
- ❌ Create specs or files (that's `/cmd:generate-spec`'s job)
- ❌ Ask multiple questions at once
- ❌ Skip research phase
- ❌ Make assumptions without checking codebase first

## Complementary to Slash Commands

This skill **complements** existing spec generation:

```
User request → Planning skill (research) → /cmd:generate-spec (spec creation)
```

- **Planning skill**: Research, clarification, architecture exploration
- **/cmd:generate-spec**: Spec writing, file creation, index updates
- **/generate-prd**: PRD creation for larger features
- **/generate-feature**: Alternative spec format

## Level of Involvement

**Moderate** - Balance depth with efficiency:
- **Research deeply**: Explore codebase, find patterns, identify constraints
- **Ask strategically**: ONE question at a time with context-based suggestions
- **Document findings**: Summarize architecture, existing patterns, complexity
- **Prepare handoff**: Create clear context for spec generation
- **Don't overstep**: Leave spec writing and file creation to slash commands

## Example Usage

```
User: "Plan adding user notifications feature"

Planning skill workflow:
1. Research: Find existing notification patterns (grep for "notification", "alert", etc.)
2. Check: `.agent/docs/` for notification architecture (if exists)
3. Context7: Fetch WebSocket or push notification docs (if needed)
4. Ask: "What type of notifications? In-app, email, push, or all three?"
   Suggestions:
   1. In-app only (recommended - simpler, use WebSocket pattern)
   2. Email integration (adds complexity, need mail service)
   3. Other - user specifies
5. Wait for answer, continue clarification as needed
6. Assess: Initial complexity ~5-6/10 (multiple files, WebSocket integration)
7. Output: "Found WebSocket handler pattern in X, session events in Y.
   Recommend: Extend existing WebSocket system, add Notification model,
   create UI toast component. Estimated 5-6/10 complexity."
8. Suggest: "Ready to generate spec with /cmd:generate-spec?"
```

## Integration Notes

- **context7 MCP**: Optional but recommended for external docs
  - Install: https://context7.com/
  - Check availability before use
  - Graceful fallback to WebFetch/WebSearch
- **Permission mode**: Works best in plan mode (read-only exploration)
- **Output**: Text summary, not files (spec generation creates files)
