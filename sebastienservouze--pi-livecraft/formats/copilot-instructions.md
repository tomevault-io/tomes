# Agent instructions

Pi Livecraft is designed to be changed by the agents that use it. Work from evidence, change behavior at its owning boundary, and stop as soon as the request is proved.

## Start with the closest contract

For any repository task that does not name an exact file or symbol, the first repository tool call must read [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md), even when the likely guide is already known. Read the closest guide and, when linked, its feature README in that order; do not preload unrelated documentation.

If the task names an exact file or symbol, start there. Still read the applicable guide before editing when the change crosses or depends on a documented boundary.

- Read [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) only when the proposed change modifies a contract across the frontend, HTTP API, manager, or Pi process boundaries. Merely inspecting a caller across a boundary does not count.
- Read [`docs/MANAGER-LIFECYCLE.md`](docs/MANAGER-LIFECYCLE.md) before changing manager runtime, supervision, or restart behavior.
- Treat facts stated by the selected guide as established evidence. Start with its named paths and verify a fact only when source contradicts it or an implementation decision remains unresolved.
- Source code and shared TypeScript types are authoritative for implementation details. Keep affected documentation aligned when its contract changes.

## Choose the exploration mode

### Read-only explanation or plan

Unless a concrete contradiction appears, use this sequence:

1. Read the routed guide and feature README.
2. Read the owning source definition named by that documentation.
3. Read at most one representative sibling or one affected integration point, whichever can change the file list or contract.
4. Identify validation from the guide, package scripts, or nearest test name. Do not read a test body when only its path or command is needed.
5. Stop and answer.

Do not walk every layer in a documented data-flow diagram or inspect all siblings, callers, styles, and tests merely to make the plan feel complete. Exceed the sequence only when a specific unresolved fact can change feasibility, files, contract, or risk; make the one call that resolves it, then reassess.

### Mutation or bug

Use only the decision gates whose condition is true; they are not a checklist, and documentation or an earlier read may already satisfy one.

- **Owner unknown** — Search the routed area for the exact identifier, route, command, label, type, or error, then read only enough of its definition to establish the contract.
- **Shared behavior changes** — Search exact usages, then read only callers whose differences could change the fix or its risk.
- **A boundary contract changes** — Read the architecture guide and the shared protocol type for that boundary.
- **Behavior is non-trivial or regressed** — Locate the nearest focused test and use it as the regression proof.
- **No unresolved decision can change the solution** — Stop exploring and edit.

For a bug, trace the common cause before protecting symptoms. For any extra tool call, identify the unresolved fact and the decision it could change; if neither is concrete, stop.

### Tool discipline

- Once the owning area is known, every `find` or `grep` must use its narrowest known path. Start with 20–30 results and refine the path or pattern before widening.
- Do not reread a file unless a different range answers a named missing fact. When documented siblings share one pattern, inspect one representative only.
- Do not open a second guide unless the selected guide reveals an uncovered boundary. Do not search for completeness.
- Ignore dependencies, generated artifacts, logs, and history unless they are the subject. Parallelize only independent reads or searches, never dependent steps or writes.
- If evidence conflicts, test one alternative hypothesis or widen one level, then reassess.

## Architecture and safety boundaries

- The React frontend communicates with the backend only through `src/api.ts`.
- `src/App.tsx` orchestrates cross-cutting state. Area-specific rendering and logic belong in `src/features/<feature>/`.
- Colocate feature CSS. Reserve `src/styles/` for global and responsive rules; `src/App.css` remains the ordered entry point.
- `server/backend.ts` owns the HTTP API and SSE stream and may restart without interrupting Pi.
- `server/manager.ts` alone owns `pi --mode rpc` processes; never move that ownership into the backend.
- Manager runtime files are declared in `server/manager-runtime-files.json`; keep it aligned with runtime imports. Edits are detected without interrupting Pi and take effect only after the user requests the guarded restart. Never restart the manager or supervisor yourself, bypass that lifecycle, or change its contract without explicit approval.
- Use Pi's public RPC protocol. Do not inspect internal files to reproduce an RPC capability.
- The application listens only on `127.0.0.1`. Do not broaden exposure without explicit authentication and scoping.
- Do not add a database, frontend router, state manager, or UI library without demonstrated need.
- Before visual UI work, load the project-specific `livecraft-ui` skill. Do not load another visual skill unless explicitly requested, and do not load any for state, API, data, or event wiring without visual impact.

## Execute safely

A direct request authorizes reversible local edits, targeted checks, and a task-only commit. Ask immediately before deleting files, data, or user content; installing dependencies or running unrequested network commands; including pre-existing work; pushing, publishing, deploying, or taking another external, irreversible, or sensitive action. Never expose secrets.

Before the first mutation, run `git status --short` once. Preserve pre-existing work and inspect its diff only when it overlaps files you must change.

## Make the smallest compatible change

- Reuse existing helpers, types, patterns, dependencies, and platform capabilities. Add no speculative abstraction, dependency, configuration, compatibility path, or capability.
- Validate trust boundaries and preserve unrelated APIs, protocols, and formats. Put new files in the smallest owning area; avoid generic `utils` or `common` buckets without demonstrated shared ownership.
- Remove obsolete code, styles, files, and documentation. Do not include generated artifacts, logs, or local environment files. Before a compatibility break, stop and report its behavior, impact, and migration.
- Use English for identifiers, filenames, comments, and JSDoc. Keep TypeScript strict and explicit, use the repository formatter, and document non-obvious contracts, invariants, side effects, or rationale without paraphrasing code.

## Validate proportionately

Choose the smallest check that proves the changed behavior; each command must add distinct evidence.

- For documentation or simple configuration, use a targeted reread or syntax check. For local behavior, use the nearest focused test; add one only for non-trivial logic, a reproducible regression, or a durable contract.
- For TypeScript, run Oxlint plus the focused test, typecheck, or build that covers the risk. Reserve broad checks for cross-cutting or high-regression changes.
- Do not duplicate checks. Reread changed files, check for accidental edits or apparent secrets, and never hide a relevant failure or commit through it.

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run format:check -- <paths>
npm run build
npm test -- test/file.test.ts
npm test -- --test-name-pattern="test name" test/file.test.ts
npm test
```

The Pi RPC integration test requires a configured `pi` command. Its `/agent` coverage is skipped when that extension is unavailable. Pi documentation is installed at `$(npm root -g)/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/docs/`.

`npm run eval:documentation-routing` launches external model calls and may incur cost. Run it only with explicit approval.

## Finish cleanly

- Stage only your files or hunks with `git add -- <targets>`; never use a blind global add or include another contributor's work.
- Commit after relevant validation passes, using a real Gitmoji and a concise imperative English subject without a conventional prefix. Never push implicitly.
- Report the result, essential files, checks actually run, and commit identifier. Mention a risk or follow-up only when real.
