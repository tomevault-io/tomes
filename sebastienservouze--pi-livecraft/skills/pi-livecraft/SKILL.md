description: Use for any visual creation, redesign, layout, styling, theming, or visual fix in Pi Livecraft. Covers components, panels, modals, toolbars, forms, settings, widgets, status displays, and conversation surfaces. Not for frontend changes without visual impact (API calls, state wiring, data plumbing, event handlers). Use when this capability is needed.

Designs and refines Pi Livecraft's interface. Production code that respects the visual contract; no speculative decoration.

## Required workflow

Before changing or creating any visual element, you MUST follow these steps in order:

1. **Identify the owning feature** — `src/features/<feature>/`. If the change touches several features, identify the one that owns the dominant surface.
2. **Read the component and its colocated CSS.** Understand the existing layout, spacing, control sizes, and states before writing anything.
3. **Read the canonical reference for the surface type:**
   - Controls, toolbars, selectors, icon buttons → `src/features/composer/composer.css`
   - Modals, dialogs, options, actions, backdrops → `src/features/dialogs/dialogs.css`
   - Colours, surfaces, tokens, theme derivation → `src/styles/base.css` and `docs/HOW-TO-THEME.md`
   - Breakpoints, reduced motion, global animations → `src/styles/responsive.css`
4. **Define the action hierarchy, visual groups, and alignment axes** before modifying CSS. A row of controls needs a single height and consistent vertical rhythm; a panel needs a clear surface stack; an action needs a clear primary/secondary distinction.
5. **After the change, visually inspect the touched surface** at rest, on hover, on focus, when active, when disabled, with long text, in both light and dark themes, and at every affected responsive width. Fix visible misalignments at the source — never compensate with one-off margins.

## Visual character

Pi Livecraft is a dense, calm, precise work tool. Hierarchy comes from contrast, surface layering, alignment, and density — not decoration. Interfaces stay compact without feeling cramped. Colour serves actions and states, not ornament.

## Defaults for new code

These are starting points for new surfaces. Existing CSS contains historical variations; do not reproduce them blindly. When in doubt, prefer the composition in the canonical references.

| Concern | Default | Variant |
|---|---|---|
| Compact control | 30 px height | — |
| Primary icon action | 36 px height | `.icon-button.send` |
| Control / menu radius | 7–10 px | — |
| Large surface radius | 12–14 px | Modal, composer, settings panel |
| Small group gap | 5–8 px | Toolbar controls, options |
| Content / section gap | 10–18 px | Padding inside panels |
| Row alignment | Single height, vertical center | Flex `align-items: center` |
| Functional colours | Theme variables only | `var(--accent)`, `var(--line)`, etc. |
| 1D layout | Flexbox | `flex-wrap` when narrow |
| 2D layout | Grid | `grid-template-columns` |

## Mandatory states

Every interactive element MUST handle these states. Every container with content MUST handle overflow.

- **Hover** — `:hover:not(:disabled)`; subtle border or surface lift, `180ms ease` transition.
- **Focus-visible** — `outline: 2px solid var(--accent)` with `outline-offset` 1–2px, or the `:focus-within` ring pattern on composed controls (composer, inputs).
- **Active** — `:active:not(:disabled)`; subtle scale press (`scale(0.97)`).
- **Disabled** — `opacity: .42–.55` and `cursor: not-allowed`; `box-shadow: none`, `transform: none`.
- **Overflow** — `text-overflow: ellipsis`, `white-space: nowrap`, and a `min-width: 0` ancestor for flex/grid children; `overflow-y: auto` on scrollable panels.
- **Dark mode** — inspect when colours, surfaces, borders or shadows are touched.
- **Responsive** — inspect at the breakpoints that affect the feature (850px, 700px, 480px, and any local breakpoint in the feature CSS).
- **Reduced motion** — every new animation gets a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` override (instant or crossfade).
- **Long text / empty state** — when the surface can display variable content, confirm it does not overflow, clip, or collapse silently.

## Anti-slop guard

Before committing, reject these patterns. If one appears, restructure the element instead of refining it.

- Gradient text, glassmorphism, or decorative blurs with no functional role.
- A new card grid when a panel, list, or divider would carry the same information with less chrome.
- Nested bordered surfaces without a functional reason.
- A one-off colour, radius, shadow or margin to disguise a layout misalignment.
- Adjacent controls with different heights in the same row.
- Over-sized spacing borrowed from landing-page conventions (hero padding, massive gaps).
- Reproducing a historical CSS variation because it exists in a feature — when the canonical references show a cleaner pattern, follow the canonical pattern.
