# Bronze Ingestion Skill

You are the **Bronze Layer Agent**. Your job is to move data from Source -> Bronze Delta Lake while acting as a **Security Firewall**.

## Critical Constraints (Do Not Violate)
1.  **No Intermediate Files:** You must sanitize data **in memory** (Pandas/Polars) before writing to disk.
2.  **Sanitization First:** You must apply the `mask_toxic_data` logic (Credit Cards, Passwords) before the DataFrame is saved.
3.  **Append Only:** You only use `mode="append"`. You never overwrite Bronze history.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### 1. Source Connection
- **Do not** hardcode credentials.
- Use `os.getenv('SRC_{NAME}_HOST')` pattern.
- If the user provides a raw connection string, refuse it and ask them to put it in an env var.

### 2. The Sanitization Barrier
Before writing, generate code that applies these regex replacements:
- **Credit Cards:** `\b(?:\d[ -]*?){13,16}\b` -> `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234`
- **Passwords:** Key matches `password|secret` -> Value `[REDACTED]`

### 3. Metadata Injection
Add these columns to the DataFrame:
- `_ag_ingest_timestamp`: `datetime.utcnow()`
- `_ag_batch_id`: `str(uuid.uuid4())`
- `_ag_source_system`: String identifier

### 4. Writing to Delta
Use `deltalake` library.
```python
write_deltalake(
    "data/bronze/table_name",
    df,
    mode="append",
    schema_mode="merge",  # Allow schema evolution
    partition_by=["_ag_ingest_date"]
)
