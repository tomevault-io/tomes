# Flow Documenter

Help users document discoveries, maintain task notes, and generate summaries using Flow framework projects. This Skill ensures documentation stays synchronized with actual work and follows Flow patterns.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when the user wants to document:
- "Document this finding"
- "Add notes to the task"
- "Write this down"
- "Summarize what we did"
- "Generate a changelog"
- "Update the task notes"
- "Record this discovery"

## Documentation Philosophy

**Keep it Actionable**: Documentation should help future work, not just record history.

**Where to Document**:
- **Task ## Notes**: Discoveries, decisions, patterns found during work
- **Implementation Notes**: What was built, why, challenges solved
- **DASHBOARD.md**: Phase/task completion summaries
- **PLAN.md**: Architecture decisions, DO/DON'T guidelines (via flow-architect)

**Slash Commands**:
- `/flow-summarize`: Generate project summary from all phases/tasks/iterations

## Task Notes Section

### What Goes in ## Notes

**Discoveries**:
- Patterns found during implementation
- Unexpected behaviors discovered
- Design insights that emerged
- Technical constraints learned

**Decisions**:
- Choices made and why
- Trade-offs accepted
- Approaches tried and rejected

**References**:
- Related tasks or iterations
- External documentation consulted
- Framework patterns followed

### Task Notes Template

```markdown
## Notes

**Key Discoveries**:
- [Discovery 1]: [What was found and why it matters]
- [Discovery 2]: [What was found and why it matters]

**Design Decisions**:
- [Decision 1]: Chose [approach] because [rationale]
- [Decision 2]: Deferred [feature] to V2 due to [constraint]

**Challenges & Solutions**:
- **Challenge**: [Problem encountered]
  - **Solution**: [How it was solved]
  - **Impact**: [Effect on design/implementation]

**References**:
- Related to [Task X, Iteration Y]
- Pattern from DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines [X-Y]
- External: [URL or doc reference]
```

### Example Task Notes

```markdown
## Notes

**Key Discoveries**:
- **Stripe SDK Limitation**: v12 doesn't expose retry configuration hooks
  - Led to custom RetryPolicy implementation
  - See PLAN.md Technology Choices section for detailed rationale
- **Error Classification Pattern**: Transient vs permanent errors need different handling
  - Implemented ErrorMapper with strategy pattern
  - Allows easy extension for new error types

**Design Decisions**:
- Chose exponential backoff over linear for retry logic
  - Rationale: Better for API rate limiting (Stripe recommendation)
  - Added jitter to prevent thundering herd problem
- Deferred refund processing to V2
  - Rationale: Not needed for initial launch, adds complexity
  - Can be added later without refactoring payment flow

**Challenges & Solutions**:
- **Challenge**: Testing retry timing is difficult (delays slow down test suite)
  - **Solution**: Made clock injectable for testing (dependency injection)
  - **Impact**: Tests run fast, retry logic still thoroughly tested
- **Challenge**: Stripe test API has rate limit (100 req/hour)
  - **Solution**: Used mocks for most tests, real API for critical paths
  - **Impact**: Test suite completes in < 10 seconds

**References**:
- Related to Task 3, Iteration 2 (Error Handling)
- Pattern from DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 1798-1836 (Implementation Pattern)
- Stripe API Docs: https://stripe.com/docs/api/errors
```

## Bug Documentation

### When to Document Bugs

**In Task Notes** (if discovered during implementation):
- Bugs found in existing code (not your changes)
- Workarounds applied
- Issues deferred to future tasks

**Use Bug Documentation Template**:

```markdown
**Bugs Discovered**:

### Bug 1: [Short Description]

**Location**: `path/to/file.ts:lines X-Y`

**Problem**:
```[language]
// Current buggy code
```

**Impact**: [What breaks or degrades]

**Action Taken**: [Fixed immediately | Documented for future | Workaround applied]

**Fix** (if applied):
```[language]
// Corrected code
```

**Recommendation**: [Priority level and next steps]
```

### Example Bug Documentation

```markdown
**Bugs Discovered**:

### Bug 1: Race Condition in PaymentService

**Location**: `src/services/PaymentService.ts:145-152`

**Problem**:
```typescript
async processPayment(amount: number) {
  const status = await this.checkStatus();
  // Race condition: status can change between check and update
  await this.updatePayment(status);
}
```

**Impact**: Could cause duplicate charges in concurrent requests

**Action Taken**: Documented here, created separate task for fix (not in scope of current iteration)

**Recommendation**: High priority fix for next sprint - use database transactions
```

## Changelog Generation

### Using /flow-summarize

The `/flow-summarize` command generates summaries from PLAN.md structure:

```bash
/flow-summarize
```

**Outputs**:
- All phases with completion status
- All tasks with iteration counts
- High-level summary of what was accomplished

### Manual Changelog Format

For release notes or detailed changelogs:

```markdown
## Changelog - [Version/Date]

### Added
- [Feature 1]: [Brief description]
- [Feature 2]: [Brief description]

### Changed
- [Change 1]: [What changed and why]
- [Change 2]: [What changed and why]

### Fixed
- [Bug 1]: [What was fixed]
- [Bug 2]: [What was fixed]

### Deprecated
- [Old feature]: [Replacement or removal plan]
```

### Example Changelog

```markdown
## Changelog - Payment Integration V1

```

## DASHBOARD Updates

### When to Update DASHBOARD

**Task completion**:
- Mark task ✅ COMPLETE
- Update completion percentages
- Update "📍 Current Work" section

**Phase completion**:
- Mark phase ✅ COMPLETE
- Add phase summary
- Update overall project status

### DASHBOARD Update Pattern

```markdown
## 📍 Current Work

- **Phase**: [Current Phase Name](phase-X/)
- **Task**: [Current Task Name](phase-X/task-Y.md)
- **Status**: [Brief status summary]
- **Next**: [What to do next]

---

## 📊 Progress Overview

### Phase X: [Phase Name] ✅ COMPLETE

**Summary**: [1-2 sentence summary of what was accomplished]

**Key Deliverables**:
- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]

**Tasks**:
- ✅ **Task 1**: [Name] (X/Y iterations)
- ✅ **Task 2**: [Name] (X/Y iterations)
```

## Pre-Implementation Task Documentation

### Pre-Task Notes Pattern

When documenting completed pre-implementation tasks:

```markdown
#### Pre-Implementation Tasks

##### ✅ Pre-Task 1: [Name]

**Completed**: 2025-01-15

**Why Blocking**: [Explanation of why this had to be done first]

**Changes Made**:
- [Change 1]: [Description]
- [Change 2]: [Description]
- [Change 3]: [Description]

**Files Modified**:
- `path/to/file1.ts` (+X lines, -Y lines)
- `path/to/file2.ts` (+X lines, -Y lines)

**Impact on Main Iteration**:
[How this pre-task enables or simplifies the main work]
```

## Discovery Documentation

### When You Discover Something Important

**Document immediately** in task notes if it's:
- A pattern that should be followed consistently
- A constraint that affects future work
- An insight that changes understanding
- A decision that future developers need to know

### Discovery Template

```markdown
**Discovery: [Short Title]**

**Context**: [When/how this was discovered]

**What We Learned**:
[Detailed explanation of the discovery]

**Implications**:
- [Impact 1]: [How this affects current or future work]
- [Impact 2]: [How this affects current or future work]

**Action Taken**:
- [Action 1]: [What was done in response]
- [Action 2]: [What was done in response]
```

### Example Discovery

```markdown
**Discovery: Stripe Webhook Signatures Expire After 5 Minutes**

**Context**: While implementing webhook endpoint, discovered signature validation fails for delayed webhooks

**What We Learned**:
Stripe webhook signatures include a timestamp and expire after 5 minutes to prevent replay attacks. If webhook processing is delayed (queue backlog, system downtime), validation will fail even for legitimate webhooks.

**Implications**:
- **Current Work**: Need to capture raw webhook payload before validation for debugging
- **Future Work**: V2 webhook processing must handle signature expiration gracefully
- **Monitoring**: Add alerts for webhook validation failures

**Action Taken**:
- Documented in PLAN.md Scope section (V1 assumes < 5min processing)
- Added pre-validation logging of raw payload
- Created V2 task for robust webhook handling
```

## Interaction with Other Flow Skills

**Implementation Stage** (flow-implementer Skill):
- Implementer executes work
- Documenter records discoveries ← YOU ARE HERE

**Review Stage** (flow-reviewer Skill):
- Reviewer validates consistency
- Documenter updates based on findings

## References

- **Task Structure**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 238-566
- **Implementation Pattern**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 1798-1836
- **Status Markers**: DEVELOPMENT_FRAMEWORK.md lines 1872-1968
- **Slash Command**: `/flow-summarize` (generate summaries)

## Key Reminders

**Before documenting**:
- [ ] Identify correct location (Task Notes, DASHBOARD, PLAN.md)
- [ ] Keep it concise and actionable
- [ ] Focus on "why" not just "what"

**During documentation**:
- [ ] Use templates for consistency
- [ ] Link to related tasks/iterations
- [ ] Include impact/implications

**After documenting**:
- [ ] Verify documentation is findable (proper section, clear title)
- [ ] Check if DASHBOARD needs updating
- [ ] Consider if discovery should go in PLAN.md (via flow-architect)
