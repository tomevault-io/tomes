description: After code or config changes, update README/DEVELOPMENT.md to reflect new state, check doc consistency, and run linters. Use after modifying docker-compose.yml, .env.example, project structure, features, scripts, ports, commands, or any user-facing behavior. Use when this capability is needed.

# Post-Change Checks

After making substantive changes, run through these checks before finishing.

## 1. Documentation Updates

Identify which docs may be affected by the change:

| Change type | Docs to check |
|-------------|---------------|
| New/changed env vars | `.env.example`, README (Configuration), DEVELOPMENT.md |
| Port changes | DEVELOPMENT.md (ports table), `docs/NETWORKING.md` |
| New scripts/commands | README (Quick Start / CLI), DEVELOPMENT.md |
| Docker/compose changes | README (Quick Start), DEVELOPMENT.md (Docker section) |
| New features/roadmap items | README (Roadmap) |
| New dependencies | README (Prerequisites), DEVELOPMENT.md (Tech Stack) |
| Project structure changes | DEVELOPMENT.md (Project Structure tree) |
| New docs added | Link from README or DEVELOPMENT.md where relevant |

**Update only what changed** - don't rewrite unrelated sections.

## 2. Consistency Checks

After updating docs, verify:

- [ ] Commands in docs actually work (correct paths, flags, service names)
- [ ] Port numbers match between `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, docs
- [ ] Env var names match between `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`, docs
- [ ] Service names in docs match `docker-compose.yml`
- [ ] File paths referenced in docs exist
- [ ] No user-specific absolute paths — use `~` (tilde) per project convention
- [ ] `uv run` used everywhere instead of `python` (project convention)

## 3. Lint Check

Run `ReadLints` on all files you edited to catch introduced errors. Fix any you introduced.

## When to Skip

- Pure refactors with no user-facing or config changes
- Changes only to test files
- Changes deep inside a single module with no doc surface
