# What's-new release-notes skill

Formalizes the previously ad-hoc process of writing an Aspire **"What's new in
Aspire N.N"** page as a single, step-argument skill with a repeatable lifecycle.
Invoke it as `/whatsnew {modality}` — the modality argument selects one phase:

```
{draft/scaffold} → {research} → {critique} → {validate} → {polish} → {review}
   init/structure   dossier+draft  self-review   fact-check   edits+data    sign-off
```

Each phase has a dedicated spec under [`references/`](./references/). This skill
**orchestrates** existing skills — it does not duplicate them. `{research}` is the
phase that **authors** the article body from its dossier; `{critique}`/`{validate}`
then review and fact-check that draft, and `{polish}` finalizes it. Because
`{polish}` edits content *after* `{validate}`, it must end with a **fresh
`{validate}` pass** so nothing ships unchecked (see below).

## Dispatch on the modality argument

Read the argument, then follow the matching spec. `draft`, `scaffold`, and `init`
are aliases for the same phase. If no argument is given, ask which phase to run (or
infer from context — e.g. a fresh release with no page → `draft`).

| Modality | Alias | Purpose | Spec | Edits content? |
|----------|-------|---------|------|----------------|
| `draft` | `scaffold`, `init` | Stand up branch, draft PR, skeleton MDX, banner, sidebar, version constants. **Structure only.** | [`01-draft-scaffold.md`](./references/01-draft-scaffold.md) | Skeleton only |
| `research` | — | Enumerate every change into an impact-focused **dossier**, then **author the first-draft prose** into the MDX from it. | [`02-research.md`](./references/02-research.md) | **Yes — drafts the body** |
| `critique` | — | Content-quality **self-review** of draft vs dossier; severity-ranked findings. | [`03-critique.md`](./references/03-critique.md) | **No — reports only** |
| `validate` | — | **Ralph loop** with `doc-pr-reviewer` until 100% factual; samples/links/assets. **No `pnpm build`.** | [`04-validate.md`](./references/04-validate.md) | Fixes only |
| `polish` | — | Editorial pass + CI triage + diagnostics-author `@mentions` + **automated data ingestion**, then a **final `{validate}` pass**. | [`05-polish.md`](./references/05-polish.md) | **Yes** |
| `review` | — | Undraft PR, description, reviewers + `doc-tester` **blind** run of every in-article scenario. | [`06-review.md`](./references/06-review.md) | No |

## Supporting references

- [`whats-new-template.mdx`](./references/whats-new-template.mdx) — structure-only
  skeleton the `draft` phase copies (scaffold tokens, `publishDate` frontmatter, and
  the mandated section taxonomy).
- [`writing-guidelines.md`](./references/writing-guidelines.md) — humanized voice +
  the maintainer content standards. Defers to `doc-writer` for canonical style.

## Cross-cutting rules (apply to every phase)

### Git / branching / PR
- Release work happens on a **`release/{N.N}` branch** in the repository.
- Cut `release/{N.N}` from the **latest default branch** (e.g. `main`) — fetch first so
  you branch from an up-to-date base and avoid merge conflicts.
- Iterate via a **draft PR** from `release/{N.N}` into the repository's **default
  branch**. Open it **after** the scaffold is committed (a branch with no commits
  ahead of the default branch has no diff, so the PR can't be created); `{review}`
  marks it ready for review.

### Voice & quality (see `writing-guidelines.md` + `doc-writer`)
- **Impact first, positives first, KISS.** No walls of text, no marketing fluff.
- **Judicious `<Aside>`** — a spotlight, not a floodlight. Don't burn the reader's eyes.
- **Content standards:** Deployment and Integrations are **separate** sections; a
  distinct **"New integrations"** section for brand-new ones; a **"Default container
  image updates"** section for tag bumps. The release-date badge + GitHub release-notes
  link render **automatically** from `publishDate` + slug — never hand-place them.

### Safety / mechanics
- **Never run `pnpm build` locally** — validate build-readiness by inspection.
- Each modality is **idempotent** — safe to re-run; `critique`/`validate` loop to
  convergence.
- **Re-validate after polish.** Any edit `{polish}` makes lands *after* the
  `{validate}` gate, so `{polish}` must finish with a fresh `{validate}` pass and
  `{review}` confirms it — the committed article never bypasses validation.
- Prefer built-in tools over shell; Windows-friendly paths.

## Key repository paths

| What | Path |
|------|------|
| What's-new pages | `src/frontend/src/content/docs/whats-new/aspire-N-N.mdx` (JA under `.../ja/whats-new/`) |
| Version constants | `src/frontend/config/aspire-versions.mjs` (`currentAspireMajorMinorVersion`, `currentAspireVersion`) |
| Sidebar | `src/frontend/config/sidebar/docs.topics.ts` (What's-new `items`) |
| Announcement banner | `banner:` frontmatter on `src/frontend/src/content/docs/index.mdx`, `src/frontend/src/content/docs/docs.mdx`, `src/frontend/src/content/docs/community/index.mdx`, and each `src/frontend/src/content/docs/{locale}/index.mdx` (+ `.../ja/docs.mdx`); rendered by `src/frontend/src/components/starlight/Banner.astro` |
| Assets | `src/frontend/src/assets/whats-new/aspire-<version>/` |
| Container image data | `src/frontend/src/data/container-images.json` |
| Diagnostics articles | `src/frontend/src/content/docs/diagnostics/aspire<area><NNN>.mdx` → `/diagnostics/aspire<NNN>/` |
| Data ingestion | `src/frontend/scripts/update-integration-data.ps1` (`pnpm update:all`) |

## Orchestrated skills

`doc-writer` (voice/style) · `doc-pr-reviewer` (validate loop) · `doc-tester` (review
blind run) · `twoslash-validator` (TS samples) · `update-integrations` /
`update-samples` / `container-images` (polish data ingestion).
