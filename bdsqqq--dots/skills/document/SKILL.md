# document

apply documentation philosophy: explain why, not what.

## when to use

- writing jsdocs for components or functions
- updating README or project docs
- adding inline comments during implementation
- reviewing existing documentation for cleanup

## workflow

1. check if documentation is needed — if it describes obvious behavior, skip it
2. identify the non-obvious why: design constraints, behavioral consequences, inheritance warnings
3. write terse, lowercase prose
4. delete anything that merely restates the code

## quick reference: why over what

**delete this:**
```typescript
/** context provider that wraps children in a DisclosureProvider. */
```

**keep this:**
```typescript
/**
 * blocks CompositeContext so nested Lists create isolated focus loops.
 * essential for "Simple API" goal — our List is "greedy" and would
 * otherwise join parent's arrow-key navigation.
 */
```

## what to document

- design rationale and constraints
- context shadowing / inheritance warnings
- non-obvious behavioral consequences
- internal decisions affecting correctness

## what to delete

- obvious behavior ("renders a button")
- what the function name already says
- what types already express

## jsdoc structure

```typescript
/**
 * one-line description of purpose or behavior.
 *
 * additional context if design rationale is complex (keep brief).
 *
 * @prop propName - what it does
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <Component>content</Component>
 * ```
 */
```

## maintainer notes

preserve `@bdsqqq notes` or similar when they explain non-obvious decisions:

```typescript
/**
 * @bdsqqq notes: alpha colors avoided for strokes due to compounding
 * overlap issues at intersection points.
 */
```

## colocate context with code

jsdocs are source of truth. upon finishing a task, colocate valuable context as jsdocs — only notes that explain non-obvious why. delete everything else.

## tone

- lowercase only (ALL CAPS for emphasis)
- terse, no unsupported claims
- specific over general; describe, don't emote
