description: Resolves the current VibeAround session ID for use by other skills. Use when another skill (va-preview, vibearound handover) needs session context, or when the user asks "what is my session ID", "get session info", or "check session status". Use when this capability is needed.

# VibeAround Session ID

Resolves the current session ID. Other VibeAround skills call this when they need session context for preview, handover, or lifecycle management.

## How to Resolve

Call the `get_session_id` MCP tool. Include only optional arguments whose
values are present:

Read these values if available:

- Current working directory
- `$VIBEAROUND_AGENT_KIND` or `$VIBEAROUND_LAUNCH_TARGET`
- `$VIBEAROUND_LAUNCH_ID`
- `$VIBEAROUND_PROFILE_ID`
- `$VIBEAROUND_CHANNEL_KIND`
- `$VIBEAROUND_CHAT_ID`

```
Tool: get_session_id
Server: vibearound
Arguments:
  agent_kind: "<value of $VIBEAROUND_AGENT_KIND or $VIBEAROUND_LAUNCH_TARGET if present>"
  cwd: "<current working directory>"
  launch_id: "<value of $VIBEAROUND_LAUNCH_ID if present>"
  profile_id: "<value of $VIBEAROUND_PROFILE_ID if present>"
  channel_kind: "<value of $VIBEAROUND_CHANNEL_KIND if present>"
  chat_id: "<value of $VIBEAROUND_CHAT_ID if present>"
```

The MCP tool resolves the session from explicit parameters, VibeAround route
state, agent metadata, or workspace-aware auto-discovery, and records it
against the launch context when `launch_id` is available.

## Return Value

Return the session ID string to the calling skill. If neither method succeeds, return nothing — callers handle the missing case gracefully.
