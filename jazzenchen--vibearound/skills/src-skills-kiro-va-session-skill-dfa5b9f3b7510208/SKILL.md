# VibeAround Session ID

## How to Resolve

Call the `get_session_id` MCP tool. Include only optional arguments whose
values are present:

Read these values if available:

- Current working directory
- `$VIBEAROUND_LAUNCH_ID`
- `$VIBEAROUND_PROFILE_ID`
- `$VIBEAROUND_CHANNEL_KIND`
- `$VIBEAROUND_CHAT_ID`

```
Tool: get_session_id
Server: vibearound
Arguments:
  agent_kind: "kiro"
  cwd: "<current working directory>"
  launch_id: "<value of $VIBEAROUND_LAUNCH_ID if present>"
  profile_id: "<value of $VIBEAROUND_PROFILE_ID if present>"
  channel_kind: "<value of $VIBEAROUND_CHANNEL_KIND if present>"
  chat_id: "<value of $VIBEAROUND_CHAT_ID if present>"
```

Kiro does not currently have a VibeAround local session-file reader. The MCP
tool can resolve route-managed sessions and records them against the launch
context when `launch_id` is available.

Return the session ID string from the MCP tool. If the tool cannot resolve one,
return nothing — callers handle the missing case gracefully.
