# VibeAround Markdown Preview

After you create or update a markdown document, generate a styled preview so the user can read it in their browser or phone with beautiful formatting.

## When to Use

- You just created or updated a README.md, documentation, or any .md file
- The user asks to "show me the doc", "preview the README", or "let me see it"
- Only when the VibeAround MCP server is connected

**Proactive behavior**: After creating or updating any markdown file, proactively ask the user if they'd like to preview it (e.g. "Want me to generate a preview link so you can see it?"). If the user confirms, call `md_preview`. Do NOT call the tool without asking first.

## Prerequisites

The VibeAround MCP server must be connected (server name: `vibearound`). If not available, tell the user to start the VibeAround desktop app.

## Steps

### 1. Call md_preview

```
Tool: md_preview
Server: vibearound
Arguments:
  file: "<path to the markdown file>"  (absolute or relative to cwd)
  cwd: "<current working directory>"
  title: "<document title>"  (optional, defaults to filename)
```

If the tool says the workspace is not registered, call `register_workspace` with the `cwd` first, then retry.

### 2. Present BOTH links to the user

The tool returns an Owner link and a Share link. Always show **both** in this format:

```
Markdown preview 已就绪：
- 你的预览: <owner_url>
- 分享链接: <share_url>（10 分钟有效）
```

Or in English:

```
Markdown preview ready:
- Owner: <owner_url>
- Share: <share_url> (expires in 10 min)
```

**Never omit either link.** The owner link is permanent. The share link is temporary and needs no auth.

## Error Handling

- **MCP server not available**: The VibeAround desktop app may not be running.
- **Workspace not registered**: Call `register_workspace` first, then retry.
- **File not found**: Verify the file path is correct and the file exists.
