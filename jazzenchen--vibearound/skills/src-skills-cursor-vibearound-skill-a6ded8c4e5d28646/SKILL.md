# VibeAround Session Handover

Hand over the current coding session via the VibeAround orchestrator. The user can then pick it up from any connected IM channel (the pickup is not tied to a specific channel).

## When to Use

- User says `/vibearound handover`
- User asks to "hand over", "transfer", or "continue" the session on their phone or another device

## Prerequisites

The VibeAround MCP server must be connected (server name: `vibearound`). If not available, tell the user to start the VibeAround desktop app.

## Handover Steps

### 1. Get your session ID

Use the `/va-session` skill to resolve your current session ID.
Also read `$VIBEAROUND_PROFILE_ID` from the environment if present. VibeAround-launched sessions should have it, including `direct`; external user-started sessions may omit it.

### 2. Call prepare_handover

```
Tool: prepare_handover
Server: vibearound
Arguments:
  session_id: "<session_id from step 1>"  (pass if available)
  cwd: "<current working directory>"
  agent_kind: "cursor"
  profile_id: "<VIBEAROUND_PROFILE_ID if present>"  (optional; omitted means direct)
```

If the tool says the workspace is not registered, ask the user for confirmation, then call `register_workspace` with the `cwd`, and retry.

### 2. Present the result

Show the `/pickup` command returned by the tool. The user can paste it in any IM chat connected to VibeAround to resume the session there with the same agent.

## Error Handling

- **MCP server not available**: Start the VibeAround desktop app.
- **Workspace not registered**: Offer to register it (needs user confirmation).
