description: Advanced synthesis on the loaded GPU host TTS model via the raw audiocpp gateway (/tts): seed, language, voice-design instructions, builtin/voice-pack speakers, and multi-speaker dialogue with overlapping interruptions. None of which the built-in GuideAnts audio tools expose. Use when this capability is needed.

# audio.cpp synthesis controls (experimental)

Paths — fixed layout, do not probe or re-derive. The sandbox CWD is the
notebook's **output directory**. This skill's scripts live under
`Skills/audiocpp-tts-controls/scripts/` relative to it. Write deliverables with
**bare filenames** (e.g. `-o scene.wav`); never prefix with `Output/`.

Product TTS is `{text, voice, speed}`. This skill calls raw
`/tts/v1/audio/speech` on the GPU host. Deliverables are WAVs written to the CWD (bare filenames).

## Environment (required for PC → the GPU host)

```text
AUDIOCPP_SKILL_BASE_URL=http://<gpu-host-lan-ip>:8112/audiocpp-skill
AUDIOCPP_SKILL_TOKEN=<same as the GPU host GA_AUDIOCPP_SKILL_TOKEN>
```

A TTS model must already be loaded on the GPU host via GuideAnts Settings. Chatterbox
(`ResembleAI/chatterbox`) is the known-good catalog entry for cloning /
voice-pack presets.

## Long-form single-speaker narration (video scripts)

**Skill users:** write the final narration script as plain text (markdown headers
ok) and call `narration.py`. Do **not** chunk, concat, trim silence, or run
preflight yourself — the tool owns all of that.

`start` runs preflight, creates a job, and spawns a **detached background worker**
that synthesizes the full script. Each sandbox call returns immediately. Poll
`status` until `"status": "done"`. Use `cancel` if the user stops the turn or
asks to abort.

```bash
python3 Skills/audiocpp-tts-controls/scripts/narration.py start script.txt \
  -o narration.wav \
  --voice narrator

python3 Skills/audiocpp-tts-controls/scripts/narration.py status narration.wav
```

Repeat `status` until `"status": "done"`. Job state lives in `.audiocpp-narration/`
beside the output. Status responses report **job-level** progress only (`progress`,
`elapsed_seconds`, `eta_seconds`) — never chunk indices or segment counts.

To replace a finished or failed job:

```bash
python3 Skills/audiocpp-tts-controls/scripts/narration.py start script.txt \
  -o narration.wav --voice narrator --force
```

To abort a running job:

```bash
python3 Skills/audiocpp-tts-controls/scripts/narration.py cancel narration.wav
```

## Short utterances

For a single line or short clip, use `engine_tool.py speech` directly:

```bash
python3 Skills/audiocpp-tts-controls/scripts/engine_tool.py speech "Hello there" \
  -o out.wav \
  [--seed 42] \
  [--language de] \
  [--instructions "a calm, deep narrator voice"] \
  [--voice Vivian]
```

- `--instructions` only on `vdes`-task models (VoiceDesign catalog entry).
- `--language` values are family-specific; engine errors name what is valid.
- Same text + seed + model ⇒ same audio.

## Voices

```bash
python3 Skills/audiocpp-tts-controls/scripts/engine_tool.py voices
```

Voice ids come from the **voice-pack** baked into the GPU host AI image at
`/opt/guideants/voice-pack/` (or a custom mount at
`/opt/guideants/custom-voice-pack`). The engine resolves a `--voice` id to a
reference clip **server-side** — you do NOT stage the clip for pack voices.
A custom user voice (e.g. a cloned reference added to the pack's
`manifest.json`) works the same way: pass its `voiceId` as `--voice`.

### Choosing a voice for a script (important)

The voice-pack `manifest.json` records each voice's `language` and `gender`.
**Match the voice's `language` to the script's language.** Chatterbox is an
English model: an in-distribution pair (English reference + English text)
locks onto one stable voice. An out-of-distribution pair (e.g. a French-
reference `ff_*` voice speaking English) produces an **unstable, text-
sensitive accent** — the same speaker drifts into different accents across
lines, and **a seed cannot fix this** (a seed only controls sampling noise on
top of a stable distribution). If a voice sounds like a different person on
each line, check its `language` in the manifest first, then swap for a
matching-language voice.

## Multi-speaker dialogue (overlap / interruptions)

```bash
python3 Skills/audiocpp-tts-controls/scripts/multi_speaker.py \
  scene.json -o scene.wav \
  [--model chatterbox] \
  [--seed-map '{"narrator":1001,"alice":3003}']
```

`scene.json` is an array of lines:

```json
[
  {"voice": "narrator",  "text": "What's the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow?"},
  {"voice": "bm_george", "text": "African or European?", "overlap_ms": 400},
  {"voice": "bf_alice",  "text": "Oh no, you two are doing the swallow thing again.", "overlap_ms": 600}
]
```

- `voice` / `text` — required.
- `overlap_ms` — how many ms this line **starts before the previous line
  ends**. `0` (default) = clean turn-taking; `>0` = the new speaker talks
  over / interrupts. For a realistic interruption the overlap should be
  **~1s+** so real words from both speakers are audible at once; 200–300 ms
  only overlaps a trailing consonant and does NOT read as an interruption.
- `seed` — per-line override. Omit to use an auto per-speaker seed.

### How the mix works (do not change these)

1. **Two tracks on one timeline.** Each line is placed at its computed start
   offset on a shared buffer and **additively mixed** where they overlap.
   No crossfade, no truncation — both voices are genuinely audible together.
2. **Preserve the native sample rate.** The TTS engine emits **24 kHz** mono.
   Writing the output at a different rate (e.g. 48 kHz) plays the audio at
   the wrong speed and mangles it. Always pass the source `framerate` through.
3. **One seed per speaker.** Chatterbox is non-deterministic per call. Assign
   each speaker a **fixed seed** (the script auto-derives one from the voice
   name by default) so a speaker sounds consistent across all their lines.
   This only works for in-distribution (matching-language) voices — see above.

### Realistic interruption beats

To make interruptions sound natural, write the **interrupted** speaker's line
as a full flowing sentence that is still going when the other person cuts in
(so the overlap zone contains real words from both), rather than a truncated
fragment. A short `overlap_ms` on a clean turn is fine for pacing, but the
"talk-over" moments should have `overlap_ms` ≥ ~1000.

## When this isn't enough

- Loaded model rejects a `voice` preset id → confirm the pack is mounted and
  the id is in `manifest.json`; for a brand-new custom voice add it to the
  pack and rebuild/remount, or stage a clip and use **audiocpp-voice-clone**
  (`--voice-ref`).
- No TTS loaded on the GPU host → blocked; say so.

## Reporting

End by telling the user what worked and what was blocked, quoting preflight
evidence from `narration.py start` when using long-form narration. For
multi-speaker output, state the total duration, per-speaker seeds, and which
lines carry `overlap_ms`. For long narration, quote `status` (`progress`,
`elapsed_seconds`, `eta_seconds`, final `result.duration_seconds`) — not
chunk or segment details.
