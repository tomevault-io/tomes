description: Gather missing product, UX, technical, and delivery constraints before planning or coding. Use when a request is underspecified, when several implementations are plausible, when frontend work needs explicit acceptance criteria, or when the agent must ask structured questions before acting. Use when this capability is needed.

# Requirement Interviewer

Collect missing constraints through phased questioning. Refuse to plan, code, or propose irreversible implementation details until the required answers are complete.

## Workflow

1. Read `references/question-flow.md`.
2. Ask only the next unanswered question cluster, not the whole interview at once.
3. Read `references/answer-completeness.md` to decide whether the reply is sufficient or needs follow-up.
4. Read `references/gating-rules.md` before moving from clarification into planning.
5. After each phase, summarize confirmed facts, explicit assumptions, and open questions.
6. Only when all mandatory gates pass, hand off a concise, execution-ready brief or plan.

## Interview Contract

- Ask 1-3 short questions at a time.
- Prefer constrained choices when possible.
- Keep questions ordered: objective first, implementation later.
- If the user says "you decide", record the default explicitly as an assumption.
- Separate confirmed requirements from inferred assumptions.

## Guardrails

- Do not generate code, file edits, or architecture proposals before gates pass.
- Do not ask duplicate questions.
- Do not jump into low-level implementation details before product intent is clear.
- Do not silently fill critical gaps with guesses.
- Stop and ask for explicit approval when the decision changes scope, cost, or stack direction.
