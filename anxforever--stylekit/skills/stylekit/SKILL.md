description: Apply a specific, consistent visual style to frontend UI you are generating. Use when building or styling web UI (pages, components, dashboards, landing pages) and you want a named aesthetic — Glassmorphism, Neo-Brutalist, Cyberpunk, Bauhaus, Apple, Stripe, Linear, and many more — instead of generic AI defaults. StyleKit gives you design tokens, component recipes, and AI rules for each style, with themes installable through the shadcn registry. Use when this capability is needed.

# StyleKit

StyleKit is an open-source style library for AI coding with 135 curated
visual styles, each with machine-readable design tokens, component recipes, and
AI rules. Use it to make the UI you generate look like a deliberate, named style
instead of generic AI output.

## When to use

- The user asks for a specific look ("make it look like Stripe", "cyberpunk
  dashboard", "cozy cottagecore blog", "brutalist landing page").
- You are generating frontend UI and want a coherent, consistent design system
  rather than ad-hoc styling.
- The user wants their AI-generated site to match an aesthetic across many
  components.

## Step 1 — Pick a style

Browse the catalog and machine-readable index:

- Human catalog: https://www.stylekit.top/styles
- Browse by theme: https://www.stylekit.top/collections (dark-mode, retro-vintage,
  anime-manga, game-ui, colorful-bold, hand-drawn)
- Colors / hex codes: https://www.stylekit.top/colors
- JSON list of every style: `GET https://www.stylekit.top/api/styles`
  → `{ total, styles: [{ slug, nameEn, description, ... }] }`
- Full machine-readable spec for agents: https://www.stylekit.top/llms-full.txt

Each style has a `slug` (e.g. `glassmorphism`, `neo-brutalist`, `stripe-style`,
`bauhaus`). You need the slug for the next step.

## Step 2 — Install the style

- **shadcn registry** (drop the theme into an existing shadcn/ui project):
  ```bash
  npx shadcn add https://www.stylekit.top/r/<slug>.json
  ```

The repository also contains CLI and MCP packages for contributor development. They are not
published to npm and must be built from a local StyleKit checkout:

- **CLI local preview**:
  ```bash
  pnpm --filter stylekit-cli build
  node packages/cli/dist/index.js add <slug>
  ```
- **MCP local preview**:
  ```bash
  pnpm --filter stylekit-mcp build
  node packages/mcp/dist/index.js
  ```

Full per-style spec (tokens, recipes, do/don't rules) lives at
`https://www.stylekit.top/styles/<slug>` and in the style's registry JSON.

## Step 3 — Apply the style's rules

When generating components, honor the style's constraints:

1. Use the style's **design tokens** (colors, spacing, typography, shadows,
   radii) — do not invent your own values.
2. Follow the **AI rules** (the do/don't list) for that style — these encode
   what makes the style read as intentional (e.g. Neo-Brutalist: thick borders,
   hard shadows, no rounded corners; Glassmorphism: high blur, translucency,
   inner glow).
3. Keep the style consistent across every component you generate in the session.

## Notes

- Styles span three axes: brand-inspired (Apple, Stripe, Linear, Notion,
  GitHub), aesthetic (Glassmorphism, Neo-Brutalist, Cyberpunk, Vaporwave), and
  cultural (Bauhaus, Ghibli, Wabi-Sabi, Ukiyo-e).
- Everything is free and open source (MIT). Full docs: https://www.stylekit.top/developers
