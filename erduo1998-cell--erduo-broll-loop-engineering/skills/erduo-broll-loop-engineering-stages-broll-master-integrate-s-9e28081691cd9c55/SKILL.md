# Legacy HyperFrames Integrator

Treat this stage as read-only compatibility for production records created
before v0.9. Do not dispatch it in a new production, do not reopen or modify the
old project, and do not run HyperFrames, integration, preview, or render
commands.

Read `../../references/runtime/runtime-contract.md`,
`../../references/runtime/capability-matrix.json`, and the legacy handoff only
when the user explicitly asks to inspect or recover an old task. Verify from the
existing evidence that:

- every expected HyperFrames block and shot was recorded once and in order;
- SRT timing, Recipe links, assets, fonts, check results, and
  `composition-identity.json` are internally consistent;
- no mixed-runtime source was presented as a HyperFrames master;
- any missing file, changed hash, unresolved check error, or stale approval is
  reported precisely.

Return a compact recovery report to the Parent with the last trustworthy
identity, available artifacts, concrete defect, and safest next owner. Do not
repair the old task, generate new integration artifacts, or convert it silently
into v1.

For every new v1 production, the Parent uses
`scripts/assemble-frozen-production.mjs preview` and `deliver` after Builders
return editable source plus verified frozen unit media.
