## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to proactively monitor database transactions, identify performance bottlenecks like long-running queries and lock contention, and alert on anomalies such as high rollback rates. It provides insights into database health and helps prevent performance degradation.

## How It Works

1. **Activation**: The user's request triggers the `database-transaction-monitor` plugin.
2. **Transaction Monitoring**: The plugin executes the `/txn-monitor` command to initiate transaction monitoring.
3. **Alerting**: The plugin analyzes transaction data and generates alerts based on predefined thresholds for long-running transactions, lock wait times, and rollback rates.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Detect and kill long-running transactions blocking other queries.
- Monitor lock wait times and identify deadlock patterns.
- Track transaction rollback rates for error analysis.

## Examples

### Example 1: Detecting Long-Running Transactions

User request: "Find any long-running database transactions."

The skill will:
1. Activate the `database-transaction-monitor` plugin.
2. Execute the `/txn-monitor` command to identify transactions exceeding a predefined duration threshold.

### Example 2: Analyzing Lock Contention

User request: "Analyze database lock contention."

The skill will:
1. Activate the `database-transaction-monitor` plugin.
2. Execute the `/txn-monitor` command to monitor lock wait times and identify deadlock patterns.

## Best Practices

- **Threshold Configuration**: Configure appropriate thresholds for long-running transactions and lock wait times to minimize false positives.
- **Alerting Integration**: Integrate transaction alerts with existing monitoring systems for timely notification and response.
- **Regular Review**: Regularly review transaction monitoring data to identify trends and proactively address potential performance issues.

## Integration

This skill can be integrated with other monitoring and alerting tools to provide a comprehensive view of database health. It complements tools for query optimization and database schema design.
