## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to create well-formatted, informative commit messages automatically. By analyzing staged changes, it generates messages that adhere to conventional commit standards, saving developers time and ensuring consistency.

## How It Works

1. **Analyzing Staged Changes**: The skill examines the changes currently staged in the Git repository.
2. **Generating Commit Message**: Based on the analysis, it constructs a conventional commit message, including type, scope, and description.
3. **Presenting for Confirmation**: The generated message is displayed to the user for review and approval.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Create a commit message from staged changes.
- Generate a conventional commit message.
- Use the `/commit-smart` or `/gc` command.
- Automate the commit message writing process.

## Examples

### Example 1: Adding a New Feature

User request: "Generate a commit message for adding user authentication"

The skill will:
1. Analyze the staged changes related to user authentication.
2. Generate a commit message like: `feat(auth): Implement user authentication module`.
3. Present the message to the user for confirmation.

### Example 2: Fixing a Bug

User request: "/gc fix for login issue"

The skill will:
1. Analyze the staged changes related to the login issue.
2. Generate a commit message like: `fix(login): Resolve issue with incorrect password validation`.
3. Present the message to the user for confirmation.

## Best Practices

- **Stage Related Changes**: Ensure that only related changes are staged before generating the commit message.
- **Review Carefully**: Always review the generated commit message before committing to ensure accuracy and clarity.
- **Provide Context**: If necessary, provide additional context in the request to guide the AI analysis (e.g., `/gc - emphasize that this fixes a security vulnerability`).

## Integration

This skill integrates directly with the Git repository through Claude Code. It complements other Git-related skills by providing a streamlined way to create informative and standardized commit messages.
