## Overview

This skill enables Claude to automatically perform security vulnerability testing on applications and APIs. It leverages the security-test-scanner plugin to identify potential weaknesses and generate comprehensive reports.

## How It Works

1. **Initiate Scan**: The plugin is activated when security testing is requested.
2. **Execute Tests**: The plugin automatically runs a suite of security tests covering OWASP Top 10, injection flaws, XSS, CSRF, and authentication/authorization issues.
3. **Generate Report**: The plugin compiles the test results into a detailed report, highlighting vulnerabilities, severity ratings, and remediation steps.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Perform a security vulnerability scan of an application.
- Test for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
- Identify SQL injection or XSS vulnerabilities.
- Assess authentication and authorization security.

## Examples

### Example 1: OWASP Top 10 Vulnerability Scan

User request: "Perform a security test focusing on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities for the /api/ endpoint."

The skill will:
1. Activate the security-test-scanner plugin.
2. Execute OWASP Top 10 tests against the specified endpoint.
3. Generate a report detailing any identified vulnerabilities and their severity.

### Example 2: SQL Injection Testing

User request: "Test the API for SQL injection vulnerabilities."

The skill will:
1. Activate the security-test-scanner plugin.
2. Run SQL injection tests against the API.
3. Report any successful injection attempts.

## Best Practices

- **Scope Definition**: Clearly define the scope of the security test (e.g., specific endpoints, modules).
- **Authentication**: Provide necessary authentication credentials for testing protected resources.
- **Regular Testing**: Schedule regular security tests to identify newly introduced vulnerabilities.

## Integration

This skill can be integrated with other plugins to automatically trigger security tests as part of a CI/CD pipeline or after code changes. It also integrates with reporting tools for centralized vulnerability management.
