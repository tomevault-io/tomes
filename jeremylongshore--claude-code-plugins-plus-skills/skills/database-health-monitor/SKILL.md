## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to proactively monitor the health of your databases. It provides real-time metrics, predictive alerts, and automated remediation capabilities to ensure optimal performance and uptime.

## How It Works

1. **Initiate Health Check**: The user requests a database health check via natural language or the `/health-check` command.
2. **Collect Metrics**: The plugin gathers real-time metrics from the specified database (PostgreSQL or MySQL), including connection counts, query performance, resource utilization, and replication status.
3. **Analyze and Alert**: The collected metrics are analyzed against predefined thresholds and historical data to identify potential issues. Predictive alerts are generated for anomalies.
4. **Provide Report**: A comprehensive health report is provided, detailing the current status, potential issues, and recommended remediation steps.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Check the current health status of a database.
- Monitor database performance for potential bottlenecks.
- Receive alerts about potential database issues before they impact production.

## Examples

### Example 1: Checking Database Performance

User request: "Check the health of my PostgreSQL database."

The skill will:
1. Connect to the PostgreSQL database.
2. Collect metrics on CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, connection counts, and query execution times.
3. Analyze the collected data and generate a report highlighting any performance bottlenecks or potential issues.

### Example 2: Setting Up Monitoring for a MySQL Database

User request: "Monitor the health of my MySQL database and alert me if CPU usage exceeds 80%."

The skill will:
1. Connect to the MySQL database.
2. Configure monitoring to track CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, and connection counts.
3. Set up an alert that triggers if CPU usage exceeds 80%.

## Best Practices

- **Database Credentials**: Ensure that the plugin has the necessary credentials to access the database.
- **Alert Thresholds**: Customize alert thresholds to match the specific needs of your application and infrastructure.
- **Regular Monitoring**: Schedule regular health checks to proactively identify and address potential issues.

## Integration

This skill can be integrated with other monitoring and alerting tools to provide a comprehensive view of your infrastructure's health.
