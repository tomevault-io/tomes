## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to efficiently manage snapshot tests by analyzing differences, selectively updating snapshots based on intentional changes, and identifying potential regressions. It provides a streamlined approach to maintain snapshot test suites across various JavaScript testing frameworks.

## How It Works

1. **Analyzing Failures**: Reviews failed snapshot diffs, highlighting intentional and unintentional changes with side-by-side comparisons.
2. **Selective Updating**: Updates specific snapshots that reflect intentional UI or code changes, while preserving snapshots that have caught regressions.
3. **Batch Processing**: Allows for batch updating of related snapshots to streamline the update process.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Analyze snapshot test failures after code changes.
- Update snapshot tests to reflect intentional UI changes.
- Identify and preserve snapshots that are catching regressions.

## Examples

### Example 1: Updating Snapshots After UI Changes

User request: "I've made some UI changes and now my snapshot tests are failing. Can you update the snapshots?"

The skill will:
1. Analyze the snapshot failures, identifying the diffs caused by the UI changes.
2. Update the relevant snapshot files to reflect the new UI.

### Example 2: Investigating Unexpected Snapshot Changes

User request: "My snapshot tests are failing, but I don't expect any UI changes. Can you help me figure out what's going on?"

The skill will:
1. Analyze the snapshot failures, highlighting the unexpected diffs.
2. Present the diffs to the user for review, indicating potential regressions.

## Best Practices

- **Clear Communication**: Clearly state the intention behind updating or analyzing snapshots.
- **Framework Awareness**: Specify the testing framework (Jest, Vitest, etc.) if known for more accurate analysis.
- **Selective Updates**: Avoid blindly updating all snapshots. Focus on intentional changes and investigate unexpected diffs.

## Integration

This skill works independently but can be used in conjunction with other code analysis and testing tools to provide a comprehensive testing workflow.
