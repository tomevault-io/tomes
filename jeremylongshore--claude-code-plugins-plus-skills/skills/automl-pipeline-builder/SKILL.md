## Overview

This skill automates the creation of machine learning pipelines using the automl-pipeline-builder plugin. It simplifies the process of building, training, and evaluating machine learning models by automating feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.

## How It Works

1. **Analyze Requirements**: The skill analyzes the user's request and identifies the specific machine learning task and data requirements.
2. **Generate Code**: Based on the analysis, the skill generates the necessary code to build an AutoML pipeline using appropriate libraries.
3. **Implement Best Practices**: The skill incorporates data validation, error handling, and performance optimization techniques into the generated code.
4. **Provide Insights**: After execution, the skill provides performance metrics, insights, and documentation for the created pipeline.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Build an automated machine learning pipeline.
- Automate the process of model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
- Generate code for a complete AutoML workflow.

## Examples

### Example 1: Creating a Classification Pipeline

User request: "Build an AutoML pipeline for classifying customer churn."

The skill will:
1. Generate code to load and preprocess customer data.
2. Create an AutoML pipeline that automatically selects and tunes a classification model.

### Example 2: Optimizing a Regression Model

User request: "Create an automated ml pipeline to predict house prices."

The skill will:
1. Generate code to build a regression model using AutoML techniques.
2. Automatically select the best performing model and provide performance metrics.

## Best Practices

- **Data Preparation**: Ensure data is clean, properly formatted, and relevant to the machine learning task.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the performance of the AutoML pipeline and retrain the model as needed.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected issues during pipeline execution.

## Integration

This skill can be integrated with other data processing and visualization plugins to create end-to-end machine learning workflows. It can also be used in conjunction with deployment plugins to automate the deployment of trained models.
