## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to be a FinOps expert, helping users identify and implement strategies to minimize their cloud expenditures. By analyzing current resource utilization and suggesting optimized configurations, it ensures efficient cloud spending.

## How It Works

1. **Analyzing Cost Data**: Claude analyzes the user's request to identify the scope and cloud provider (if specified).
2. **Generating Optimization Recommendations**: Claude formulates specific recommendations to reduce costs, such as rightsizing instances, identifying unused resources, or leveraging reserved instances.
3. **Creating Cost Report**: Claude generates a detailed cost report summarizing current spending and potential savings.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Reduce your AWS, Azure, or GCP cloud spending.
- Generate a report detailing current cloud costs.
- Identify underutilized or unused cloud resources.

## Examples

### Example 1: Reducing AWS EC2 Costs

User request: "Optimize my AWS EC2 costs. I'm running several t3.medium instances."

The skill will:
1. Analyze the usage patterns of the t3.medium instances.
2. Suggest rightsizing to t3.small or using reserved instances if utilization is consistently high.
3. Generate a cost report showing potential savings from the recommended changes.

### Example 2: Identifying Idle Azure Resources

User request: "Generate a report of idle resources in my Azure subscription."

The skill will:
1. Identify any virtual machines, storage accounts, or other resources that have been idle for a specified period.
2. Recommend terminating or deallocating the idle resources.
3. Provide a cost report detailing the savings achieved by removing the idle resources.

## Best Practices

- **Resource Utilization**: Regularly review resource utilization metrics to identify opportunities for rightsizing.
- **Reserved Instances**: Leverage reserved instances or committed use discounts for consistently used resources.
- **Cost Monitoring**: Implement continuous cost monitoring and alerting to track spending trends and identify anomalies.

## Integration

This skill can be used in conjunction with other DevOps plugins to automate the implementation of cost optimization recommendations. For example, it can integrate with infrastructure-as-code tools to automatically resize instances or terminate unused resources.
