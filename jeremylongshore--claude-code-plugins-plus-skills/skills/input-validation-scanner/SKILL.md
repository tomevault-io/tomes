## Overview

This skill automates the process of identifying potential input validation flaws within a codebase. By analyzing how user-provided data is handled, it helps developers proactively address security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. This skill streamlines security audits and improves the overall security posture of applications.

## How It Works

1. **Initiate Scan**: The user requests an input validation scan, triggering the skill.
2. **Code Analysis**: The skill uses the input-validation-scanner plugin to analyze the specified codebase or file.
3. **Vulnerability Identification**: The plugin identifies instances where input validation may be missing or insufficient.
4. **Report Generation**: The skill presents a report highlighting potential vulnerabilities and their locations in the code.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Audit a codebase for input validation vulnerabilities.
- Review newly written code for potential XSS or SQL injection flaws.
- Harden an application against common web security exploits.
- Ensure compliance with security best practices related to input handling.

## Examples

### Example 1: Identifying XSS Vulnerabilities

User request: "Scan the user profile module for potential XSS vulnerabilities."

The skill will:
1. Activate the input-validation-scanner plugin on the specified module.
2. Generate a report highlighting areas where user input is directly rendered without proper sanitization, indicating potential XSS vulnerabilities.

### Example 2: Checking for SQL Injection Risks

User request: "Check the database access layer for potential SQL injection risks."

The skill will:
1. Use the input-validation-scanner plugin to examine the database access code.
2. Identify instances where user input is used directly in SQL queries without proper parameterization or escaping, indicating potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Best Practices

- **Regular Scanning**: Integrate input validation scanning into your regular development workflow.
- **Contextual Analysis**: Always review the identified vulnerabilities in context to determine their actual impact and severity.
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Ensure that all user-supplied data is validated, including data from forms, APIs, and external sources.

## Integration

This skill can be used in conjunction with other security-related skills to provide a more comprehensive security assessment. For example, it can be combined with a static analysis skill to identify other types of vulnerabilities or with a dependency scanning skill to identify vulnerable third-party libraries.
