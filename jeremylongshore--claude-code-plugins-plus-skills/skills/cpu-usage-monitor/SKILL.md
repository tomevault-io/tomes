## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to analyze code for CPU-intensive operations, offering detailed optimization recommendations to improve processor utilization. By pinpointing areas of high CPU usage, it facilitates targeted improvements for enhanced application performance.

## How It Works

1. **Initiate CPU Monitoring**: Claude activates the `cpu-usage-monitor` plugin.
2. **Code Analysis**: The plugin analyzes the codebase for computationally expensive operations, synchronous blocking calls, inefficient loops, and regex patterns.
3. **Optimization Recommendations**: Claude provides a detailed report outlining areas for optimization, including suggestions for algorithmic improvements, asynchronous processing, and regex optimization.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Identify CPU bottlenecks in your application.
- Optimize application performance by reducing CPU load.
- Analyze code for computationally intensive operations.

## Examples

### Example 1: Identifying CPU Hotspots

User request: "Monitor CPU usage in my Python script and suggest optimizations."

The skill will:
1. Analyze the provided Python script for CPU-intensive functions.
2. Identify potential bottlenecks such as inefficient loops or complex regex patterns.
3. Provide recommendations for optimizing the code, such as using more efficient algorithms or asynchronous operations.

### Example 2: Analyzing Algorithmic Complexity

User request: "Analyze the CPU load of this Java code and identify areas with high algorithmic complexity."

The skill will:
1. Analyze the provided Java code, focusing on algorithmic complexity (e.g., O(n^2) or worse).
2. Pinpoint specific methods or sections of code with high complexity.
3. Suggest alternative algorithms or data structures to improve performance.

## Best Practices

- **Targeted Analysis**: Focus the analysis on specific sections of code known to be CPU-intensive.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Consider using asynchronous operations to prevent blocking the main thread.
- **Regex Optimization**: Carefully review and optimize regular expressions for performance.

## Integration

This skill can be used in conjunction with other code analysis and refactoring tools to implement the suggested optimizations. It can also be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automatically monitor CPU usage and identify performance regressions.
