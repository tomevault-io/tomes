## Overview

This skill enables Claude to quickly verify the critical functionality of an application by running a suite of smoke tests. It provides a fast pass/fail assessment, helping to identify potential issues early in the deployment process.

## How It Works

1. **Initiate Smoke Test**: The user requests a smoke test using the `/smoke-test` or `/st` command.
2. **Execute Test Suite**: The skill executes the pre-defined suite of smoke tests, covering system health, authentication, core features, and external integrations.
3. **Report Results**: The skill provides a summary of the test results, indicating whether the tests passed or failed.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Verify application functionality after a deployment.
- Confirm system health after an upgrade.
- Sanity-check critical features after configuration changes.

## Examples

### Example 1: Post-Deployment Verification

User request: "Run a smoke test after deploying the new version."

The skill will:
1. Execute the smoke test suite.
2. Report the pass/fail status of each test, highlighting any failures in authentication or core feature validation.

### Example 2: Configuration Change Validation

User request: "/st to validate the recent database configuration changes."

The skill will:
1. Execute the smoke test suite.
2. Report the results, specifically checking the system health and integration tests to ensure the database changes didn't introduce issues.

## Best Practices

- **Focus**: Ensure smoke tests focus on the most critical user flows and system components.
- **Speed**: Keep the smoke test suite execution time under 5 minutes for rapid feedback.
- **Integration**: Integrate smoke tests into your CI/CD pipeline for automated post-deployment verification.

## Integration

This skill can be used in conjunction with other deployment and monitoring tools to provide a comprehensive view of application health and stability. It works independently, requiring only the `/smoke-test` or `/st` command to initiate.
