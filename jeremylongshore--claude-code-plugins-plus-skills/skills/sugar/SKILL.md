## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to orchestrate and monitor autonomous development processes within the Sugar environment. It provides a set of commands to create, manage, and execute tasks, ensuring efficient and automated software development workflows.

## How It Works

1. **Command Recognition**: Claude identifies the appropriate Sugar command (e.g., `/sugar-task`, `/sugar-status`, `/sugar-review`, `/sugar-run`).
2. **Parameter Extraction**: Claude extracts relevant parameters from the user's request, such as task type, priority, and execution flags.
3. **Execution**: Claude executes the corresponding Sugar command with the extracted parameters, interacting with the Sugar plugin.
4. **Response Generation**: Claude presents the results of the command execution to the user in a clear and informative manner.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Create a new development task with specific requirements.
- Check the current status of the Sugar system and task queue.
- Review and manage pending tasks in the queue.
- Start or manage the autonomous execution mode.

## Examples

### Example 1: Creating a New Feature Task

User request: "/sugar-task Implement user authentication --type feature --priority 4"

The skill will:
1. Parse the request and identify the command as `/sugar-task` with parameters "Implement user authentication", `--type feature`, and `--priority 4`.
2. Execute the `sugar` command to create a new task with the specified parameters.
3. Confirm the successful creation of the task to the user.

### Example 2: Checking System Status

User request: "/sugar-status"

The skill will:
1. Identify the command as `/sugar-status`.
2. Execute the `sugar` command to retrieve the system status.
3. Display the system status, including task queue information, to the user.

## Best Practices

- **Clarity**: Always confirm the parameters before executing a command to ensure accuracy.
- **Safety**: When using `/sugar-run`, strongly advise the user to use `--dry-run --once` first.
- **Validation**: Recommend validating the Sugar configuration before starting autonomous mode.

## Integration

This skill integrates directly with the Sugar plugin, leveraging its command-line interface to manage autonomous development workflows. It can be combined with other skills to provide a more comprehensive development experience.
