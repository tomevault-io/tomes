## Overview

This skill streamlines the process of setting up Real User Monitoring (RUM) for web applications. It guides you through the essential steps of choosing a platform, defining metrics, and implementing the tracking code to capture valuable user experience data.

## How It Works

1. **Platform Selection**: Helps you consider available RUM platforms (e.g., Google Analytics, Datadog RUM, New Relic).
2. **Instrumentation Design**: Guides you in defining the key performance metrics to track, including Core Web Vitals and custom events.
3. **Tracking Code Implementation**: Assists in implementing the necessary JavaScript code to collect and transmit performance data.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Implement Real User Monitoring on a website or web application.
- Track Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) to improve user experience.
- Monitor page load times (FCP, TTI, TTFB) for performance optimization.

## Examples

### Example 1: Setting up RUM for a new website

User request: "setup RUM for my new website"

The skill will:
1. Guide the user through selecting a RUM platform.
2. Provide code snippets for implementing basic tracking.

### Example 2: Tracking custom performance metrics

User request: "I want to track how long it takes users to complete a purchase"

The skill will:
1. Help define a custom performance metric for purchase completion time.
2. Generate JavaScript code to track the metric.

## Best Practices

- **Privacy Compliance**: Ensure compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) when collecting user data.
- **Sampling**: Implement sampling to reduce data volume and impact on performance.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to prevent tracking code from breaking the website.

## Integration

This skill can be used in conjunction with other monitoring and analytics tools to provide a comprehensive view of application performance.
