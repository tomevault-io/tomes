## Overview

This skill leverages the access-control-auditor plugin to perform comprehensive audits of access control configurations. It helps identify potential security risks associated with overly permissive access, misconfigured permissions, and non-compliance with security policies.

## How It Works

1. **Analyze Request**: Claude identifies the user's intent to audit access control.
2. **Invoke Plugin**: The access-control-auditor plugin is activated.
3. **Execute Audit**: The plugin analyzes the specified access control configuration (e.g., IAM policies, ACLs).
4. **Report Findings**: The plugin generates a report highlighting potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Audit IAM policies in a cloud environment.
- Review access control lists (ACLs) for network resources.
- Assess user permissions in an application.
- Identify potential privilege escalation paths.
- Ensure compliance with access control security policies.

## Examples

### Example 1: Auditing AWS IAM Policies

User request: "Audit the AWS IAM policies in my account for overly permissive access."

The skill will:
1. Invoke the access-control-auditor plugin, specifying the AWS account and IAM policies as the target.
2. Generate a report identifying IAM policies that grant overly broad permissions or violate security best practices.

### Example 2: Reviewing Network ACLs

User request: "Review the network ACLs for my VPC to identify any potential security vulnerabilities."

The skill will:
1. Activate the access-control-auditor plugin, specifying the VPC and network ACLs as the target.
2. Produce a report highlighting ACL rules that allow unauthorized access or expose the VPC to unnecessary risks.

## Best Practices

- **Scope Definition**: Clearly define the scope of the audit (e.g., specific IAM roles, network segments, applications).
- **Contextual Information**: Provide contextual information about the environment being audited (e.g., security policies, compliance requirements).
- **Remediation Guidance**: Use the audit findings to develop and implement remediation strategies to address identified vulnerabilities.

## Integration

This skill can be integrated with other security plugins to provide a more comprehensive security assessment. For example, it can be combined with a vulnerability scanner to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited due to access control misconfigurations. It can also be integrated with compliance tools to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements.
