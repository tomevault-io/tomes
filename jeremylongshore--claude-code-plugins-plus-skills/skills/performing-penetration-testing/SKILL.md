# Penetration Testing Skill

Security testing toolkit with three specialized scanners for web applications,
dependency chains, and source code.

## Overview

This skill provides three real, working security scanners:

1. **security_scanner.py** -- HTTP security header analysis, SSL/TLS certificate
   checks, exposed endpoint probing, dangerous HTTP method detection, and CORS
   misconfiguration testing. Targets live URLs.

2. **dependency_auditor.py** -- Unified vulnerability scanner for project
   dependencies. Wraps `npm audit` and `pip-audit` with normalized severity
   output. Targets project directories.

3. **code_security_scanner.py** -- Static analysis combining `bandit` (Python)
   with custom regex patterns for hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, command
   injection, eval/exec usage, and insecure deserialization. Targets codebases.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- `requests` library (for security_scanner.py)
- Optional: `bandit` (for code scanning), `pip-audit` (for dependency auditing)
- Optional: `npm` (for JavaScript dependency auditing)

Run the setup script to install all dependencies:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/performing-penetration-testing/scripts/setup_pentest_env.sh
```

Or with a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/performing-penetration-testing/scripts/setup_pentest_env.sh --venv
```

## Instructions

Step 1. Confirm Authorization

Before running any scan, verify the user has authorization to test the target.
Ask explicitly:

> "Do you have authorization to perform security testing on this target? I need
> confirmation before proceeding."

If testing a URL, confirm the user owns or has written permission to test it.
If testing local code/dependencies, confirm it's the user's own project.

**Never scan targets without explicit authorization.**

Step 2. Define Scope

Determine what to scan based on the user's request:

| User says | Scanner to use | Target |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| "check headers" / "scan URL" | security_scanner.py | URL |
| "audit dependencies" / "check packages" | dependency_auditor.py | Directory |
| "find secrets" / "code audit" | code_security_scanner.py | Directory |
| "full security scan" | All three | URL + Directory |
| "check SSL" / "certificate" | security_scanner.py --checks ssl | URL |
| "CORS check" | security_scanner.py --checks cors | URL |

Step 3. Run Scans

Execute the appropriate scanner(s):

**Web application scan:**
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/performing-penetration-testing/scripts/security_scanner.py TARGET_URL
```

With specific checks:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/performing-penetration-testing/scripts/security_scanner.py TARGET_URL --checks headers,ssl,endpoints,methods,cors
```

**Dependency audit:**
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/performing-penetration-testing/scripts/dependency_auditor.py /path/to/project
```

With severity filter:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/performing-penetration-testing/scripts/dependency_auditor.py /path/to/project --min-severity high
```

**Code security scan:**
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/performing-penetration-testing/scripts/code_security_scanner.py /path/to/code
```

With specific tools:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/performing-penetration-testing/scripts/code_security_scanner.py /path/to/code --tools bandit,regex --severity high
```

Step 4. Analyze Results

Review the scanner output. Each finding includes:
1. **Severity** -- critical, high, medium, low, or info
2. **Title** -- what was found
3. **Detail** -- technical explanation
4. **Remediation** -- how to fix it

Prioritize findings by severity: critical and high findings first.

Step 5. Report Findings

Present results to the user in a clear format:
5. Start with a summary (total findings by severity)
6. Group findings by severity
7. For each finding, explain the risk and provide the remediation steps
8. Reference the appropriate playbook entry from references/

Step 6. Suggest Remediations

For each finding, provide:
9. The specific code change or configuration needed
10. Reference to REMEDIATION_PLAYBOOK.md for copy-paste templates
11. Verification steps to confirm the fix works

## Scanner Reference

### security_scanner.py

```
Usage: python3 security_scanner.py URL [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --checks CHECKS    Comma-separated: headers,ssl,endpoints,methods,cors (default: all)
  --output FILE      Write JSON report to file
  --timeout SECS     Request timeout in seconds (default: 10)
  --verbose          Show detailed progress
  --help             Show help
```

Checks performed:
- Security headers: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy
- SSL/TLS: certificate validity, expiry, protocol version
- Exposed endpoints: .git, .env, admin panels, server-status, directory listing
- HTTP methods: dangerous methods (PUT, DELETE, TRACE)
- CORS: wildcard origins, reflected origins, credentials misconfiguration

### dependency_auditor.py

```
set -euo pipefail
Usage: python3 dependency_auditor.py DIRECTORY [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --scanners SCANNERS   Comma-separated: npm,pip (default: auto-detect)
  --min-severity LEVEL  Minimum severity: critical,high,moderate,low (default: low)
  --output FILE         Write JSON report to file
  --verbose             Show detailed progress
  --help                Show help
```

Auto-detects project type from package.json, requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, etc.

### code_security_scanner.py

```
Usage: python3 code_security_scanner.py DIRECTORY [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --tools TOOLS        Comma-separated: bandit,regex (default: all available)
  --output FILE        Write JSON report to file
  --severity LEVEL     Minimum severity: critical,high,medium,low (default: low)
  --exclude PATTERNS   Comma-separated glob patterns to exclude
  --verbose            Show detailed progress
  --help               Show help
```

Detects: hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, command injection, eval/exec, insecure
deserialization, weak cryptography, disabled SSL verification.

## Examples

### Quick header check

User: "Check the security headers on https://example.com"

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/performing-penetration-testing/scripts/security_scanner.py https://example.com --checks headers
```

### Full project security audit

User: "Run a full security audit on my project"

```bash
# 1. Scan dependencies
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/performing-penetration-testing/scripts/dependency_auditor.py .

# 2. Scan code for security issues
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/performing-penetration-testing/scripts/code_security_scanner.py .

# 3. If the project has a deployed URL, scan it too
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/performing-penetration-testing/scripts/security_scanner.py https://the-deployed-url.com
```

### Code-only audit for secrets

User: "Check this codebase for hardcoded secrets"

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/performing-penetration-testing/scripts/code_security_scanner.py . --tools regex --severity high
```

## Output

All scanners produce structured security reports:

- **Console report**: Markdown-formatted findings with severity, description, and remediation
- **JSON report**: Machine-readable output via `--output` flag for CI integration
- **Exit codes**: 0 = no critical/high findings, 1 = critical/high findings found
- **Risk score**: security_scanner.py provides a 0-100 score (100 = most secure)
- **Severity levels**: critical, high, medium, low, info for each finding
- **Remediation guidance**: Specific fix instructions for each finding

## Error Handling

**Missing dependencies:**
If a scanner fails because a tool isn't installed, run the setup script:
```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/performing-penetration-testing/scripts/setup_pentest_env.sh
```

**Connection errors:**
If security_scanner.py can't reach the target URL:
- Verify the URL is correct and accessible
- Check if the site requires VPN or special network access
- Try with `--timeout 30` for slow servers

**Permission errors:**
If code_security_scanner.py can't read files:
- Check file permissions in the target directory
- Exclude protected directories with `--exclude`
