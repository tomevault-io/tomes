# Creating Agents

Agents are markdown files with YAML frontmatter that define a persona and event
subscriptions. The agent runner loads these files, matches incoming events to
each agent's listen patterns, and invokes matching agents as headless Claude
Code instances.

## File Location

Agents live in `agents/` (configurable via `--agents-dir`). The filename
(without `.md`) becomes the agent's **worker ID**.

```
agents/
  code-reviewer.md    # worker ID: "code-reviewer"
  test-runner.md      # worker ID: "test-runner"
```

Use kebab-case for filenames.

## Frontmatter Format

```yaml
---
description: Brief description of the agent's purpose
listen:
  - "event.pattern"
allowed_tools:
  - "Read"
  - "Grep"
---
```

| Field           | Type     | Required | Description                                                                             |
| --------------- | -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `description`   | string   | yes      | Brief description of the agent's purpose. Included in the agent's system prompt header. |
| `listen`        | string[] | no       | Event type patterns to subscribe to. Defaults to `["*"]` if omitted.                    |
| `allowed_tools` | string[] | no       | Tool allowlist. `["*"]` grants all tools. If omitted, the agent can only push events.   |

## Listen Patterns

| Pattern          | Matches                       | Example                                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `"*"`            | All events (except from self) | Catches everything                               |
| `"task.created"` | Exact event type              | Only `task.created` events                       |
| `"task.*"`       | Prefix glob                   | `task.created`, `task.done`, `task.failed`, etc. |

An agent is invoked when **any** of its listen patterns match an incoming event.
Events emitted by the agent itself are always excluded from wildcard (`*`)
matching.

## Tool Permissions

By default, agents can only push events. Use `allowed_tools` to grant access to
additional Claude Code tools. Use `["*"]` to grant access to all tools.

File tools (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep) are restricted to the project
directory — the working directory where the agent runner was started. Agents
cannot access files outside this directory.

### Allowlist Format

| Entry                | Meaning                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `"*"`                | Allow all tools (no restrictions)                |
| `"Read"`             | Allow the Read tool                              |
| `"Bash(git:*)"`      | Allow Bash only for commands starting with `git` |
| `"Bash(npm test:*)"` | Allow Bash only for `npm test` commands          |

The runner automatically injects permission to run `busytown events push` via
Bash, so you never need to include that yourself.

### Common Presets

**Read-only** (search code, run git, push events):

```yaml
allowed_tools:
  - "Read"
  - "Grep"
  - "Glob"
  - "Bash(git:*)"
```

**Read-write** (also edit files):

```yaml
allowed_tools:
  - "Read"
  - "Grep"
  - "Glob"
  - "Edit"
  - "Write"
  - "Bash(git:*)"
```

## System Prompt Body

Everything below the closing `---` is the agent's system prompt. Write it as if
you are instructing a Claude instance:

```markdown
---
description: Reviews code for issues
listen:
  - "file.change"
---

When triggered by file changes, review the modified files for:

1. Type safety issues
2. Error handling gaps
3. Code smells
```

## Emitting Events

Agents should **push events for every significant action**. This is how agents
communicate with each other and how you can observe the system's behavior.

### When to Emit

- **Starting work** — signal that you've begun processing (`review.started`,
  `build.started`)
- **Completing work** — report results (`review.completed`, `test.passed`)
- **Reporting findings** — individual items of interest (`issue.found`,
  `suggestion.created`)
- **Errors** — something went wrong (`review.failed`, `build.error`)
- **File modifications** — you changed a file (`file.modified`, `file.created`)

### Event Type Conventions

Use dot-separated namespaces: `<domain>.<action>`

```
review.started
review.completed
issue.found
file.modified
test.passed
build.failed
```

### Pushing Events from an Agent

The agent runner injects the `busytown events push` command into each agent's
system prompt. Agents can push events by running:

```bash
busytown events push --worker <agent-id> --db events.db --type review.completed --payload '{"files":["src/app.ts"],"issues":0}'
```

Include relevant data in the `payload` so downstream agents have context.

## Complete Example

`agents/code-reviewer.md`:

```markdown
---
description: Reviews TypeScript code changes for potential issues
listen:
  - "file.change"
---

# Code Reviewer Agent

## Instructions

When triggered by file changes, review the modified TypeScript files for:

1. **Type safety issues** - Missing types, any usage, unsafe casts
2. **Error handling** - Unhandled promises, missing try/catch
3. **Code smells** - Long functions, deep nesting, code duplication

Provide a brief summary of findings. If no issues found, confirm the code looks
good.
```

## Claiming Events

Agents can claim events to coordinate work. The agent runner automatically
injects claim CLI instructions into each agent's system prompt. Claims are
first-claim-wins — only one worker can claim each event.

### Workflow

1. **Claim events** — use
   `busytown events claim --worker <id:string> --event <id:string>` to
   atomically take ownership of an event
2. **Handle claim failures** — if the claim response shows `claimed:false`,
   another worker already claimed it; move on

### Example Agent Using Claims

```markdown
---
description: Picks up work requests and reviews the code
listen:
  - "work.requested"
allowed_tools:
  - "Read"
  - "Grep"
  - "Glob"
---

When a work request event arrives, claim it before starting work. If the claim
response shows claimed:false, another agent already took it — move on.
```

### Claim Permissions

The runner automatically grants Bash permission for `busytown events` commands,
including `claim` and `check-claim`. You don't need to add them to
`allowed_tools`.

## Tips

- **Single responsibility** — each agent should do one thing well. Create
  multiple focused agents rather than one monolithic one.
- **Always emit events** — other agents (and humans) rely on the event stream to
  understand what happened. Even a "no issues found" result is worth emitting.
- **Use specific listen patterns** — prefer `"task.*"` or exact matches over
  `"*"` to avoid unnecessary invocations.
- **Kebab-case filenames** — `code-reviewer.md`, not `codeReviewer.md` or
  `code_reviewer.md`.
