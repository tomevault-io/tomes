# SKILL: Multi-Angle Code Review

> **Purpose**: Comprehensive plan review with gap detection, extended reviews, and GPT expert delegation
> **Target**: plan-reviewer Agent reviewing plans before execution

---

## Quick Start

### When to Use
- Review plan before execution (/01_confirm, /review)
- Detect gaps in external service integration
- Validate test plan completeness

### Quick Reference
```bash
# Load plan → Detect type → Run reviews → Apply findings
/review .pilot/plan/pending/plan.md
```

**In Scope**: 8 mandatory reviews, extended reviews, gap detection, findings application

**Out of Scope**: Plan creation → spec-driven-workflow | Test execution → tdd | GPT delegation → @.claude/rules/delegator/orchestration.md

---

## Execution Steps

**Core Philosophy**: Comprehensive (multi-angle) | Actionable (findings map to sections) | Severity-based (BLOCKING → Interactive Recovery)

---

## Team Lead Role

**Delegate Mode**: Team Lead operates in coordinate-only mode (Shift+Tab)

**Pattern**: Spawn review-team → Monitor reviewers → Aggregate findings → Update plan

**Native Context Isolation**: Agent Teams provides automatic context isolation per teammate

---

## Step 1: Load Plan

```bash
PLAN_PATH="${1:-$(find "$(pwd)/.pilot/plan/pending" "$(pwd)/.pilot/plan/in_progress" -name "*.md" -type f | head -1)}"
[ -f "$PLAN_PATH" ] || { echo "❌ No plan found"; exit 1; }
```

---

## Step 2: Multi-Angle Review Team

Create review-team with specialized teammates:

**Teammate 1: Test Coverage Reviewer**
```
Spawn teammate "test-reviewer" with prompt:
  "You are a tester (see @.claude/agents/tester.md).
  Review test coverage for plan: $PLAN_PATH.
  Evaluate: SCs verifiable? test commands? coverage ≥80%?
  Discuss findings with other reviewers via Message.
  Output: PASS or FAIL with detailed findings."
```

**Teammate 2: Type Safety & Quality Reviewer**
```
Spawn teammate "quality-reviewer" with prompt:
  "You are a validator (see @.claude/agents/validator.md).
  Review type safety and code quality for plan: $PLAN_PATH.
  Evaluate: TypeScript types? lint config? quality (SRP/DRY/KISS)?
  Discuss findings with other reviewers via Message.
  Output: PASS or FAIL with detailed findings."
```

**Teammate 3: Deep Code Reviewer**
```
Spawn teammate "deep-reviewer" with prompt:
  "You are a code-reviewer (see @.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md).
  Perform deep code quality review for plan: $PLAN_PATH.
  Evaluate: architecture? function size (≤50)? file size (≤200)? nesting ≤3? edge cases?
  Discuss findings with other reviewers via Message.
  Output: PASS or FAIL with detailed findings."
```

**Teammate 4: Security Reviewer**
```
Spawn teammate "security-reviewer" with prompt:
  "You are a security-analyst (see @.claude/agents/security-analyst.md).
  Review security aspects for plan: $PLAN_PATH.
  Evaluate: input validation? auth/authz? secret management? OWASP Top 10?
  Discuss findings with other reviewers via Message.
  Output: PASS or FAIL with detailed findings."
```

**Key Enhancement**: Reviewers cross-reference and debate findings via direct messaging before Team Lead aggregates final report.

## Step 3: Process Findings

| Level | Symbol | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| BLOCKING | 🛑 | Interactive Recovery |
| Critical | 🚨 | Must fix |
| Warning | ⚠️ | Should fix |
| Suggestion | 💡 | Nice to have |

```bash
echo "$findings" | grep -q "🛑.*BLOCKING" && { echo "🛑 BLOCKING"; return 1; }
```

---

## Step 4: Update Plan

| Issue Type | Target Section | Method |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| Missing step | Execution Plan | Add checkbox |
| Unclear requirement | User Requirements | Clarify wording |
| Test gap | Test Plan | Add scenario |
| Risk identified | Risks | Add item |
| Missing dependency | Scope | Add requirement |

---

## Review Workflow

**Step 0**: Extract SC count
```bash
sc_count=$(grep -c "^- \[.\] \*\*SC-" "$PLAN_PATH" || echo "0")
```

**Step 1**: Search "needs investigation/confirmation/review" keywords

**Step 2**: Type detection (code, config, docs, scenario, infra, db, ai)

**Step 3**: 8 mandatory reviews
1. Development Principles: SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI
2. Project Structure: File locations, naming
3. Requirement Completeness: Explicit + implicit
4. Logic Errors: Order, dependencies, edge cases
5. Existing Code Reuse: Search utilities, patterns
6. Better Alternatives: Simpler/scalable approaches
7. Project Alignment: Type-check, API docs
8. Long-term Impact: Consequences, technical debt

**Step 5**: Extended reviews (type-activated)
- A: API Compatibility | B: Type Safety | C: Documentation | D: Test Coverage
- E: Migration | F: Deployment | G: Prompt Engineering | H: Scenarios

**Step 6**: Autonomous perspectives
- Security | Performance | UX | Maintainability | Concurrency | Error Recovery

**Step 7**: Gap detection (BLOCKING → Interactive Recovery)
- 9.1: External API | 9.2: Database | 9.3: Async | 9.4: File Ops
- 9.5: Env Vars | 9.6: Error Handling | 9.7: Test Plan (BLOCKING)

**Step 9.5**: Multi-angle review-team (5+ SCs)
```bash
# For complex plans (5+ SCs), add design-reviewer teammate if frontend changes detected
[ "$sc_count" -ge 5 ] && grep -qiE "component|UI|frontend|React|Vue" "$PLAN_PATH" && echo "🚀 Add design-reviewer teammate"
```

**Step 10**: GPT expert (5+ SCs or architecture/security/auth)
```bash
[ "$sc_count" -ge 5 ] || echo "$PLAN_PATH" | grep -qiE "architecture|security|auth" && echo "🤖 GPT"
```
