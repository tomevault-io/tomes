# Haskell Development Super-Skill

This is the entry point for Haskell development in this repository. It coordinates the
Codex skills with the agent-agnostic repository policy in `AGENTS.md`:

- Hoogle lookup maps to `.codex/skills/hoogle`.
- Haddock dependency documentation lookup maps to `.codex/skills/haddock`.
- Formatting maps to `.codex/skills/haskell-format`, `.codex/skills/haskell-cabal-gild`,
  and the shared hooks under `.agents/hooks/`.
- Prefer HLS when available before falling back to full Cabal builds.

## Ground Rules

- Use cabal nix-style builds. `cabal.project` and `cabal.project.local` are the source of truth.
- Do not use `stack` or invoke `ghc` directly for normal validation.
- In a multi-package project, work on and build one package at a time with `cabal build <pkg>`. Get it green before moving to another package.
- Format changed `.hs`, `.lhs`, and `.hsig` files with the `haskell-format` skill before compiling.
- Format changed `.cabal`, `cabal.project`, `cabal.project.local`, and `cabal.project.freeze` files with the `haskell-cabal-gild` skill before compiling.
- Prefer `(<>)` over `(++)` for all concatenation, including lists and strings.
- Quantify lifetime type parameters as `α`, `β`, `γ`, with primes or numeric
  suffixes as needed; do not use prose lifetime names such as `lifetime`,
  `scope`, or `inner`.
- Never call `unsafePerformIO` (or `unsafeDupablePerformIO`, `unsafeThaw`,
  `unsafeIOToST`) in a `direct…` benchmark baseline. Write the plain-`vector`
  baseline with `modify`, which takes a `forall s. MVector s a -> ST s ()` and
  handles thaw/freeze itself; use `STRef` for auxiliary mutable state. See the
  benchmark section of `AGENTS.md`.
- After changing any Haskell source, run `cabal build all` and then `cabal test`
  before committing. The plain build must come first: the doctest suite reads the
  built library. Keep `-O2` (pinned in `cabal.project`); the inspection suite
  asserts optimized-Core properties that hold vacuously at `-O1`.
- There is no `package.yaml`/hpack in this repository; edit `.cabal` files directly.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the relevant package and existing conventions before editing.
2. Edit the smallest reasonable surface and format changed files.
3. Use HLS diagnostics, hover/types, go-to-definition, references, or rename when available before running a full build.
4. Look up APIs as needed, preferring local information:
   - Use the `haddock` skill for local Haddock docs and dependency source.
   - Use the `hoogle` skill for name or type-signature search.
   - Use remote Hoogle or Hackage only when local search is insufficient.
5. Build with `cabal build <pkg>` once quick diagnostics are clean or unavailable.
6. Test with `cabal test <pkg>` or the specific test target relevant to the change.

## Dependency Changes

- Edit `.cabal` files or `cabal.project` according to the project layout.
- Reformat cabal/project files with `haskell-cabal-gild`.
- Run `cabal build <pkg>` for affected packages.
- Run `cabal build all` only when a dependency or build-plan change needs broad validation or refreshed local docs.

## Companion Tools

| Need | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Typecheck, types, definitions, references, rename | HLS when available |
| Format `.hs`, `.lhs`, `.hsig` sources | `haskell-format` |
| Format `.cabal` and `cabal.project*` files | `haskell-cabal-gild` |
| Read dependency docs or source | `haddock` |
| Find a function by name or type | `hoogle` |
