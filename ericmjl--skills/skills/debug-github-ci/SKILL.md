# Debug GitHub CI

This skill guides systematic debugging of GitHub Actions (and other CI) failures and gives a clear way to "pay attention to CI" using the GitHub CLI.

## Usage

Use this skill when:

- A GitHub Actions (or other CI) workflow has failed and the user wants to fix it
- The user says they want to "watch CI," "make sure CI passes," or "pay attention to checks"
- The user shares a workflow run URL or asks to debug a failed run

Inputs: the user may give **a link to a failing job/run** or **a link to the PR**. Also accepted: PR number, branch name, or run ID. Repo can be overridden with `-R owner/repo` when not in a git checkout.

## Requirements

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated (`gh auth status`)
- Optional: `act` for running workflows locally (`brew install act`)

## What It Does

1. **Watch CI** — When the user wants to pay attention to CI, run `gh pr checks --watch` so status updates in the terminal.
2. **Inspect failures** — Fetch run metadata and logs for failed jobs.
3. **Analyze** — Identify failed job(s), step, and root cause (deps, permissions, timeouts, etc.).
4. **Reproduce** — Checkout the same commit, run the same commands (or use `act`), compare with CI.
5. **Fix** — Suggest concrete changes, commands, and preventive steps.

## How It Works

### 1. Watching CI (paying attention to checks)

When the user wants to ensure CI is working or to monitor checks (e.g. after pushing or opening a PR), run:

```bash
gh pr checks --watch --interval 5
```

Run from the repo root. If the current branch is not a PR branch, use:

```bash
gh pr checks <PR> --watch --interval 5
```

Tell the user you're watching CI so they know checks will be monitored. `--interval` is in seconds (default 10). Optional: `--fail-fast` to exit watch as soon as any check fails.

### 2. Handling the user's link

#### User gives a link to a failing job or run

- URLs look like: `.../actions/runs/<run-id>` or `.../actions/runs/<run-id>/jobs/<job-id>`
- Parse the URL to get `run-id` (and `job-id` if present)
- Use them directly:

```bash
gh run view <run-id> -R owner/repo
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed -R owner/repo
```

- To fetch logs for one specific job:

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --job <job-id> --log -R owner/repo
```

- Omit `-R owner/repo` when already in that repo.

#### User gives a link to the PR

- URL looks like: `.../pull/<number>` (e.g. `.../pull/42`)
- Get the PR's head commit, then list runs for that commit to find the failed run:

```bash
gh pr view <PR> -R owner/repo --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid
gh run list --commit <sha> -R owner/repo
```

- Optionally filter to failed runs only: `gh run list --commit <sha> --status failure -R owner/repo`. Note the run ID from the output (first column), then fetch logs as below.
- Then fetch logs as above: `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`
- To watch checks for this PR: `gh pr checks <PR> --watch --interval 5`

### 3. Extracting workflow information

From the run (and URL), identify: repository owner/name, run ID, workflow name, branch or commit that triggered the run.

### 4. Fetching logs with GitHub CLI

```bash
gh run list --limit 20
gh run view <run-id>
gh run view <run-id> --log
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

Use `--log-failed` to focus on failed job logs first.

### 5. Analyzing the failure

- Which job(s) failed and at which step
- Error messages, exit codes, stack traces
- Common causes: dependency/version issues, permissions, timeouts, resource limits, env differences
- Relevant workflow YAML (`.github/workflows/*.yaml`) and environment setup

### 6. Reproducing locally

- Checkout the same commit or branch: `git checkout <commit-sha>` or `git checkout <branch>`
- Read the workflow file to see exact commands and environment
- Run the same sequence locally (e.g. same install and test commands: `pixi install`, `pixi run test`, `npm ci && npm test`)
- Match environment versions (Python, Node, etc.) if specified in the workflow
- Optionally use `act` for closer parity:
  - `act -j <job-name>` or `act` to run jobs locally
  - Note: `act` may not support every action or secret
- Compare local vs CI output and note any environment differences

### 7. Providing fixes and follow-up

- Explain what went wrong in plain terms
- Suggest specific fixes: config changes, dependency updates, workflow edits
- Give exact commands or code snippets where helpful
- Recommend next steps (re-run, re-push, add checks) and how to avoid similar failures
- Tailor advice to the project (e.g. Python/pixi vs Node/npm)

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD060 -->

Focus on actionable, specific solutions. When the user wants to "pay attention to CI," start with `gh pr checks --watch --interval 5` and then continue with the rest of the workflow as needed.
