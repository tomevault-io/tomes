# GitHub activity report

This skill generates a markdown-friendly report of your GitHub activity over a date range using the `gh` CLI.

## Usage

Run the bundled script with optional `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` (format: `YYYY-MM-DD`).

```bash
# Default: last 7 days
bash skills/gh-activity-summary/activity-report.sh

# Specific range
bash skills/gh-activity-summary/activity-report.sh 2026-01-01 2026-01-07
```

## Requirements

- `gh` (GitHub CLI) - must be authenticated (`gh auth login`)
- `jq` - used for JSON counting and formatting

## What It Does

- Lists commits you authored in the date range.
- Lists pull requests you created and merged.
- Lists pull requests you reviewed.
- Lists issues you created.
- Prints simple summary counts for quick status updates.

## How It Works

- Uses `gh search` to query commits, PRs, and issues scoped to `@me`.
- Uses platform-aware date defaults (macOS vs Linux) when you omit dates.
- Formats output as readable markdown so you can paste it into status updates or pipe it into an LLM for summarization.

To generate a short natural-language summary, you can pipe the report into your preferred model:

```bash
bash skills/gh-activity-summary/activity-report.sh 2026-01-01 2026-01-07 | claude "Summarize this in 2-3 sentences"
```
