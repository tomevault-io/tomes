# Character Management

## Overview

Create and manage rich character profiles for a story project. Each character is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter in the `characters/` directory. Characters are cross-referenced with other story elements through kebab-case identifiers.

## Prerequisites

A story project must already exist (created via the story-init skill). Verify by checking for `story.md` in the project root.

## Creating a Character

1. Read `story.md` for genre, themes, and tone context
2. Read `characters/_index.md` for existing characters
3. Ask for the character's name and role (protagonist, antagonist, supporting, minor)
4. Build the profile through conversation, exploring:
   - Appearance and distinguishing features
   - Personality, traits, and quirks
   - Backstory and formative events
   - Motivations (external wants vs internal needs)
   - Voice and speech patterns (ask for example dialogue)
   - Character arc (starting state, turning points, ending state)
   - Key life events for the timeline
5. Write the character file using the template in `references/character-template.md`
6. Save to `characters/{name-kebab}.md`
7. Update `characters/_index.md` registry table
8. If relationships reference existing characters, update those character files too

## Updating a Character

1. Read the existing character file
2. Read `characters/_index.md` for context on other characters
3. Make the requested changes
4. If relationships changed, update the other character's file (bidirectional)
5. Update `characters/_index.md` if role or status changed

## Managing Relationships

Reference `references/relationship-types.md` for the full list of relationship types and inverse pairs.

When adding a relationship:
- Add the relationship entry to the character's frontmatter
- Add the inverse relationship to the other character's frontmatter
- Update the Relationship Map section in `characters/_index.md`

## Family Trees

Family trees are maintained in the `characters/_index.md` under the "Family Trees" section. Format:

```markdown
## Family Trees

### {Family Name}
- **{Character Name}** ({status}) - [{name-kebab}.md]
  - **{Child Name}** - [{name-kebab}.md]
  - **{Child Name}** - [{name-kebab}.md]
```

Indent children under parents. Note marriages/partnerships inline.

## Cross-Referencing

- When a character is referenced in worldbuilding (e.g., a location's `notable-characters`), ensure the link exists both ways
- When a character appears in a plot arc, ensure they're listed in the arc's `characters` frontmatter
- Character tags should be consistent across the project (e.g., if `magic-user` is used, always use that exact tag)

## Reference Files

- **`references/character-template.md`** - Full blank template for character profiles
- **`references/relationship-types.md`** - Complete relationship type reference with inverse pairs
