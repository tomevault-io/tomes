# Report Bug Skill

Automatically generate comprehensive, professional bug reports and post them directly to the GitHub repository associated with the current working directory.

## Purpose

This skill automates the creation of detailed bug reports that include:

- Clear, concise issue titles
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- Technical analysis and root cause insights
- Recommended E2E test specifications
- Professional formatting suitable for team collaboration

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Documenting a bug discovered during development or testing
- Creating a GitHub Issue to track a problem
- Generating a professional bug report with reproduction steps
- Providing E2E test recommendations for verification
- Ensuring consistent bug reporting standards across the team

## Workflow

### 1. Repository Detection

Detect the Git repository in the current working directory:

- Extract the repository owner and name from the remote origin URL
- Validate that the repository is a GitHub repository
- Handle both HTTPS and SSH remote URL formats

### 2. Bug Report Generation

Create a comprehensive bug report following this structure:

**Issue Title**: Clear, concise summary (max 80 characters)

**Issue Body**:

````markdown
## Summary

[Clear description of the issue including what went wrong and expected behavior]

## Reproduction Steps

1. [First step to reproduce]
2. [Second step to reproduce]
3. [Third step to reproduce]
   ...

## Environment

- **OS**: [Operating system and version]
- **Browser/Runtime**: [Browser or Node.js version]
- **Version**: [Application or package version]

## Technical Details

- **Component**: [Affected component/module/file]
- **Severity**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- **Affected Users**: [Scope of impact]

## Findings and Insights

### Root Cause Analysis

[Detailed technical analysis from the debugging session, explaining why the bug occurs]

### Code Locations

[Specific files, functions, and line numbers where the issue manifests]

### Potential Impact

[Description of how this bug affects users and system behavior]

### Dependencies Affected

[Other components or systems that may be impacted]

## Recommended E2E Test

```typescript
describe('Bug Fix Verification', () => {
  it('should [expected behavior after fix]', async () => {
    // Arrange: Set up test conditions
    // Act: Execute the action that previously triggered the bug
    // Assert: Verify the bug is fixed
  })
})
```
````

## Additional Context

### Error Messages

```
[Relevant error messages from logs or console]
```

### Stack Trace

```
[Stack trace if available]
```

### Related Issues

[Links to related GitHub issues if applicable]

### Screenshots/Logs

[Additional context like screenshots or log snippets]

````

### 3. GitHub Issue Creation

Use the `scripts/create_issue.sh` script to create the GitHub issue:

```bash
scripts/create_issue.sh "<title>" "<body>" "<labels>"
````

The script:

- Authenticates using GitHub CLI (`gh`)
- Validates repository permissions
- Creates the issue with specified labels
- Returns the issue number and URL

### 4. Result Presentation

Display the created issue information:

- Issue number
- Direct link to the GitHub Issue
- Confirmation of successful creation
- Applied labels

## Authentication Requirements

This skill requires GitHub CLI (`gh`) for authentication:

1. **Installation**: Ensure `gh` is installed on the system
   - macOS: `brew install gh`
   - Other platforms: https://cli.github.com

2. **Authentication**: User must be authenticated
   - Run: `gh auth login`
   - Follow the authentication flow
   - Ensure `repo` scope is included

3. **Permissions**: User must have write access to the target repository

## Using the Scripts

### create_issue.sh

The main script for creating GitHub issues:

```bash
scripts/create_issue.sh "<issue-title>" "<issue-body>" "bug,priority:high"
```

**Parameters:**

- `title`: Issue title (required, max 80 characters recommended)
- `body`: Full issue body in markdown format (required)
- `labels`: Comma-separated list of labels (optional, defaults to "bug")

**Features:**

- Validates `gh` CLI installation and authentication
- Detects repository information automatically
- Handles both SSH and HTTPS remote URLs
- Creates temporary files for issue body
- Returns issue URL and number on success
- Provides colored output for better visibility

**Error Handling:**

- Checks for `gh` CLI installation
- Verifies GitHub authentication status
- Confirms Git repository presence
- Validates GitHub remote URL

## Using the Assets

### issue_template.md

Template for generating consistent bug report bodies. Use this template to structure bug reports before passing them to the script.

The template includes placeholders for:

- `{{SUMMARY}}`: Brief description of the bug
- `{{REPRODUCTION_STEPS}}`: Numbered steps to reproduce
- `{{OS}}`, `{{RUNTIME}}`, `{{VERSION}}`: Environment details
- `{{COMPONENT}}`, `{{SEVERITY}}`, `{{AFFECTED_USERS}}`: Technical metadata
- `{{ROOT_CAUSE}}`: Root cause analysis
- `{{CODE_LOCATIONS}}`: Affected files and functions
- `{{IMPACT}}`: Potential impact description
- `{{DEPENDENCIES}}`: Affected dependencies
- `{{TEST_LANGUAGE}}`, `{{TEST_SUITE_NAME}}`, `{{TEST_DESCRIPTION}}`, `{{TEST_IMPLEMENTATION}}`: Test specification
- `{{ERROR_MESSAGES}}`, `{{STACK_TRACE}}`: Error details
- `{{RELATED_ISSUES}}`, `{{ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT}}`: Extra context

To use the template:

1. Read the template from `assets/issue_template.md`
2. Replace placeholders with actual values
3. Pass the formatted body to `scripts/create_issue.sh`

## Best Practices

1. **Provide Context**: Include relevant session information, code snippets, or error logs in the bug report
2. **Be Specific**: Use precise language for reproduction steps that anyone can follow
3. **Test Scripts**: Always include E2E test recommendations to verify the fix
4. **Severity Assessment**: Accurately assess bug severity based on impact:
   - **Critical**: System down, data loss, security breach
   - **High**: Major functionality broken, affects many users
   - **Medium**: Feature partially broken, workaround available
   - **Low**: Minor issue, cosmetic problem, edge case
5. **Labels**: Apply appropriate GitHub labels (bug, priority:high, component:auth, etc.)
6. **Screenshots**: Reference externally hosted screenshots if visual context is needed

## Example Usage

**Simple invocation:**

```
Use the report-bug skill to create an issue for the login button not responding to clicks
```

**Detailed invocation:**

```
Use report-bug to document the memory leak in the UserProfile component.
Include the findings from today's debugging session about the event listener not being cleaned up.
Recommend a test that validates proper cleanup on component unmount.
```

**With specific severity:**

```
Use report-bug to create a critical issue for the payment processing failure.
Include the error logs and stack trace from the production incident.
```

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"gh: command not found"**

- Install GitHub CLI: `brew install gh` (macOS) or visit https://cli.github.com
- Verify installation: `gh --version`

**"authentication required"**

- Run: `gh auth login`
- Follow the authentication flow
- Ensure the `repo` scope is granted

**"permission denied"**

- Verify write access to the repository
- Check GitHub authentication scope includes `repo`
- Confirm repository ownership or collaborator status

**"not a git repository"**

- Ensure execution from within a Git repository directory
- Run `git remote -v` to verify remote is configured
- Check for `.git` directory in current or parent directories

**Issue creation fails**

- Check GitHub API rate limits: `gh api rate_limit`
- Verify network connectivity to GitHub
- Ensure issue title is not empty and body is valid markdown
- Check repository settings allow issue creation

## Output Format

After successful creation, the skill returns:

```
✅ Bug report created successfully!
