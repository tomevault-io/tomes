# Gograbber Execution Skill

This skill provides instructions for AI agents on how to construct commands and execute the `gograbber` CLI tool effectively.

## Core Directives

1. **Understand Input Types (`-i` vs `-U`)**:
   - Use `-i <file>` when you have raw IP addresses, CIDR ranges, or hostnames (e.g., `10.0.0.1`, `10.0.0.0/24`, `example.com`). These targets will be routed through the TCP port scanner first.
   - Use `-U <file>` when you have a list of fully qualified URLs (e.g., `https://example.com:8443/admin`). This completely bypasses the port scanner.
   - For single targets, use `-u <url>` (e.g., `-u http://example.com`).

2. **Always Output Structured Formats**:
   - By default, gograbber outputs Markdown. When acting as an agent, always append `-f json` or `-f csv` to generate machine-readable output that you can easily parse later.
   - Example: `-f md,json,csv`

3. **Concurrency Safety**:
   - `gograbber` is highly concurrent. The default threads are `500` (`-t 500`). For smaller networks or to avoid rate limits, lower this value (`-t 50`).
   - Limit the screenshot workers to avoid CPU/memory spikes. Default is `5` (`-p_procs 5`). Do not increase this excessively unless running on a high-resource server.

## Recommended Workflows

### 1. The "Easy" Discovery Mode
If a user just wants a general scan of a target with standard web ports (80, 443, 8080, 8443) and screenshots, use `-easy`:
```bash
./gograbber -i targets.txt -w wordlist.txt -easy -f md,json
```

### 2. Comprehensive Subnet Scanning
To discover web services across a large CIDR range, specify the ports explicitly and enable all phases:
```bash
./gograbber -i 10.0.0.0/24 -p 80,443,8000,8080,8443 -scan -dirbust -w paths.txt -screenshot -f json,csv
```

### 3. Fast Screenshotting of Existing URLs
If you already possess a list of valid URLs (e.g., output from `httpx`), skip scanning and dirbusting, and go straight to screenshots:
```bash
./gograbber -U discovered_urls.txt -screenshot -f json
```

### 4. Bypassing WAFs / Rate Limits
When running against protected targets, slow down the requests (`-j`), add custom Host headers (`-H`), and supply a session cookie (`-C`):
```bash
./gograbber -i hosts.txt -dirbust -w paths.txt -screenshot -H vhosts.txt -C "sessionid=xyz123" -j 500
```

## Parsing the Output

Once `gograbber` completes, it will write files to `gograbber_output/report/`.
To read the results programmatically, load the JSON report:
```bash
cat gograbber_output/report/hack_*_Report.json | jq .
```
Each JSON object represents a `Host` and contains:
- `protocol`, `host_addr`, `port`, `path`
- `screenshot_filename` (path to the PNG/JPG file)
- `response_body_filename` (path to the raw HTML response)
