# Product Planning Skill

## Responsibilities

### 1. Product Specification Analysis

**Read and analyze product specs** in both flat and hierarchical structures:
- **Flat structure**: Single `.claude/product/index.md` file
- **Hierarchical structure**: `.claude/product/domains/*/index.md` with domain-based organization

**Identify missing requirements:**
- Features without descriptions
- Missing acceptance criteria
- Undefined user stories or use cases
- Absent technical constraints
- Unclear success metrics

**Detect ambiguous language:**
- Vague terms ("better", "improved", "user-friendly")
- Missing quantifiable metrics
- Incomplete conditional logic
- Unclear scope boundaries
- Imprecise timelines or priorities

**Check for conflicting requirements:**
- Contradictory feature descriptions
- Incompatible technical choices
- Overlapping responsibilities between domains
- Priority conflicts
- Resource allocation conflicts

### 2. Readiness Scoring

**IMPORTANT:** The authoritative readiness scoring formula is defined in `.claude/agents/product-analyzer.md`.

**Reference the product-analyzer agent for:**
- Complete readiness scoring formula with dimension weights
- Ready to Build criteria (score >= 75%, zero blocking issues, tech stack 100% specified)
- Quality dimension definitions (completeness, clarity, feasibility, testability, consistency)
- Blocking vs warning criteria
- Tech stack compatibility validation

**This skill provides:**
- Gap identification patterns
- Refinement guidance
- Best practices for product specification quality

**Prioritize gaps by severity:**
- **BLOCKING**: Cannot proceed without this information
- **WARNING**: Major ambiguity that will cause rework
- **RECOMMENDATION**: Nice-to-have details for better clarity

### 3. Refinement Guidance

**Suggest specific improvements:**
- Provide exact questions to resolve ambiguities
- Recommend specific additions to feature descriptions
- Suggest acceptance criteria templates
- Offer examples from similar features

**Ask clarifying questions:**
- Use the 5 W's framework: Who, What, When, Where, Why
- Ask about edge cases and error scenarios
- Probe for non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
- Inquire about dependencies and integrations
- Question assumptions

**Help break down large features:**
- Identify features that span multiple domains
- Suggest logical splitting points
- Recommend phased approaches
- Define clear interfaces between sub-features

### 4. Structure Validation

**Verify domain organization** (hierarchical structure):
- Each domain has clear boundaries
- No feature overlap between domains
- Domain names are descriptive and consistent
- Domain index files exist and are complete

**Check feature definitions:**
- Features follow consistent format
- Each feature has unique identifier
- Features are appropriately sized (not too large or small)
- Dependencies between features are documented

**Ensure acceptance criteria exist:**
- Criteria are testable and measurable
- Criteria cover happy path and error cases
- Criteria include non-functional requirements
- Criteria are written in Given-When-Then format (where appropriate)

## Workflow

### When Invoked

Follow this systematic approach:

### Step 1: Detect Product Structure

**Check for flat structure:**
```bash
# Look for single product spec file
.claude/product/index.md
```

**Check for hierarchical structure:**
```bash
# Look for domain-based organization
.claude/product/domains/*/index.md
.claude/product/index.md (may serve as overview)
```

**Determine which structure is in use** and adapt analysis accordingly.

### Step 2: Analyze Completeness

**For each feature, verify:**

1. **Description exists and is clear**
   - What the feature does
   - Why it's needed
   - Who will use it

2. **Acceptance criteria are defined**
   - Specific, measurable conditions
   - Cover main scenarios
   - Include error handling
   - Testable by QA or automated tests

3. **Priority is assigned using standard levels**
   - CRITICAL (must-have for MVP)
   - HIGH (important for launch)
   - MEDIUM (nice-to-have)
   - LOW (future consideration)

4. **Technical considerations noted** (if applicable)
   - Performance requirements
   - Security considerations
   - Scalability needs
   - Integration points

**For overall product, verify:**

1. **Tech stack is specified**
   - Frontend framework/library
   - Backend framework
   - Database(s)
   - Key dependencies
   - Deployment platform

2. **Goals are clear and measurable**
   - Business objectives
   - User outcomes
   - Success metrics
   - Timeline/milestones

3. **Target users are defined**
   - User personas
   - Use cases
   - User journeys

4. **Domains are well-organized** (hierarchical only)
   - Logical grouping
   - Clear responsibilities
   - Minimal coupling

### Step 3: Delegate to Product Analyzer

For comprehensive analysis including readiness scoring, **delegate to the product-analyzer agent**:

```bash
Task("product-analyzer", "Analyze .claude/product/index.md and generate product-analysis.json with readiness score and issues.")
```

The product-analyzer will:
- Calculate readiness score (0-100%) using weighted quality dimensions
- Identify blocking issues, warnings, and recommendations
- Validate priority levels (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Check tech stack compatibility
- Detect circular dependencies
- Auto-generate completion.json structure
- Apply Ready to Build criteria

**See `.claude/agents/product-analyzer.md` for:**
- Complete readiness scoring formula
- Ready to Build criteria
- Quality dimension weights
- Validation logic

### Step 4: Generate Report

**Save analysis to `.agentful/product-analysis.json`** (done by product-analyzer agent).

### Step 5: Provide Recommendations

**Generate specific, actionable recommendations:**

1. **List specific questions to ask the user:**
   - Not: "Please clarify the authentication feature"
   - Instead: "For User Authentication: Should we support OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)? What's the session timeout? Do we need 2FA?"

2. **Suggest template improvements:**
   - Provide markdown templates for missing sections
   - Show examples of well-written acceptance criteria
   - Offer feature description templates

3. **Recommend splitting/merging features:**
   - Identify overly broad features that should be split
   - Suggest combining related small features
   - Propose phased implementation approaches

4. **Provide examples:**
   - Show similar features from the codebase
   - Reference industry best practices
   - Link to relevant documentation

## Rules

### Do's

- **DO** use the product-analyzer agent for deep, comprehensive analysis
- **DO** ask specific, targeted questions with concrete examples
- **DO** save analysis results to `.agentful/product-analysis.json` for tracking over time
- **DO** provide actionable recommendations with clear next steps
- **DO** recognize and acknowledge well-written specifications
- **DO** adapt analysis based on project type (web app, CLI, library, etc.)
- **DO** consider technical feasibility when evaluating requirements
- **DO** identify dependencies between features
- **DO** suggest prioritization when conflicts arise
- **DO** use consistent terminology from the product spec
- **DO** validate priority levels are CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
- **DO** check for circular dependencies in feature relationships

### Don'ts

- **NEVER** write code - this skill focuses purely on requirements analysis
- **NEVER** make assumptions about unclear requirements - always ask
- **NEVER** provide generic feedback like "please clarify" without specific questions
- **NEVER** skip saving the analysis report
- **NEVER** approve incomplete specs just to move forward
- **NEVER** ignore conflicting requirements
- **NEVER** assume you know the user's intent - verify
- **NEVER** overlook non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
- **NEVER** accept P0/P1/P2/P3 priority levels - use CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
- **NEVER** suggest third-party services by default - prefer in-stack solutions

## Advanced Techniques

### Dependency Analysis

When analyzing features, map dependencies:
- **Technical dependencies**: Feature A requires Feature B's API
- **Logical dependencies**: Feature C can't work without Feature D
- **Data dependencies**: Feature E needs data produced by Feature F

Create dependency graph in analysis report.

**Delegate to product-analyzer for:**
- Circular dependency detection
- Topological sort for build order
- Dependency conflict resolution

### Risk Assessment

Identify risks in specifications:
- **Scope creep risk**: Features without clear boundaries
- **Technical risk**: Features pushing technology limits
- **Resource risk**: Features requiring unavailable expertise
- **Timeline risk**: Underestimated complexity

### Phased Planning

For large products, suggest phases:
- **MVP (CRITICAL features)**: Core must-have features
- **Launch (HIGH features)**: Important enhancements
- **Post-launch (MEDIUM features)**: Nice-to-have additions
- **Future (LOW features)**: Ideas for later consideration

### Stakeholder Alignment

Check for stakeholder considerations:
- Are user needs clearly mapped to features?
- Are business goals aligned with technical approach?
- Are success metrics measurable and agreed upon?

## Priority Level Guidelines

**Standard priority levels** (ONLY these are valid):

- **CRITICAL**: Must-have for MVP, blocking for launch
  - Core functionality
  - Essential user flows
  - Critical infrastructure

- **HIGH**: Important for launch, significant value
  - Major features
  - Important integrations
  - Key optimizations

- **MEDIUM**: Nice-to-have, enhances experience
  - Convenience features
  - Minor improvements
  - Optional integrations

- **LOW**: Future consideration, not needed for launch
  - Nice-to-haves
  - Experimental features
  - Deferred improvements

**Invalid priority levels** (flag as BLOCKING issue):
- P0, P1, P2, P3
- Must-have, Should-have, Nice-to-have
- 1, 2, 3, 4
- Any custom values

## Example Usage

**Scenario**: User has created a hierarchical product spec for a SaaS application.

**Command**: "Analyze my product spec and tell me if we're ready to build"

**Skill Actions**:
1. Detect hierarchical structure at `.claude/product/domains/*/index.md`
2. Read all domain index files
3. Delegate to product-analyzer agent for comprehensive analysis
4. Read generated `.agentful/product-analysis.json`
5. Present readiness score and Ready to Build status
6. List blocking issues with specific resolution steps
7. Ask clarifying questions for each gap
8. Provide next steps to achieve Ready to Build status

**Outcome**: User has clear, actionable path to complete their specification before development begins.
