description: Arrange the repository's public .pm adoption board — show status, create workstreams, capture inbox notes, promote notes into milestones, add tasks, and mark work done. Use only when the user explicitly invokes $pm or asks to update, arrange, or check the .pm board. Do not use for proposing or brainstorming new work (that is pm-brainstorm) or for ordinary code edits. Use when this capability is needed.

# Task: Arrange the `.pm` board

Usage: `/pm [status | new workstream <title> | add <wN> <idea> | promote <wN/NNN> | new milestone <wN> <title> | add-task <wN/mN> <title> | done <wN/mN/tNNN>]`

`/pm` is the **only** skill that writes to `.pm/`. It arranges milestones and tasks under the conventions below. `/pm-brainstorm` proposes; `/pm` materializes. This file (`skills/.claude/skills/pm/SKILL.md`) is the **canonical** definition of the board conventions — mission, hierarchy, sizing rule, quality gate, standing closing tasks, templates. `/pm-brainstorm` reads it at runtime and must not restate or diverge from it. Parse the subcommand from `$ARGUMENTS` (default = `status`).

## Mission — the TPM lens

This board exists to grow **adoption of Beancount.io in the open-source and agentic-coding community**. Act as the technical program manager for that goal: sequence work by adoption impact, not by what is fun to build. Every milestone must advance one of these pillars and name it in its `## Source + Goal linkage`:

| Pillar | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **A1 — Agent-native accounting** | A coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, …) can set up and maintain a beancount ledger end-to-end: skills, CLI, MCP surfaces, instruction-file quality. |
| **A2 — Frictionless onboarding** | A newcomer — human or agent — goes from zero to a working ledger in minutes: installers, `beancount-init`, quickstarts that work exactly as written. |
| **A3 — Community & distribution** | Reach and credibility: docs, examples, launches, package registries, GitHub presence, Telegram. Signals: installs, stars, skill invocations, contributors. |

## The `.pm` hierarchy

| Level | Path | Meaning | Effort |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Workstream | `wN/` (`w1`, `w2`, `w3`, …) | a general-purpose worker queue; `README.md` + inbox notes | — |
| Inbox note | `wN/NNN.md` (`w1/005.md`) | one idea or a **sub-hour** unit of work, plain markdown | ≤ ~1h |
| Milestone | `wN/mN/` (`m1`, `m2`, …) | a shippable chunk: `README.md` + task files | **> ~1h**, multiple tasks |
| Task | `wN/mN/tNNN.md` | a single unit | tens of minutes |

## Rules (enforce every time)

- **The board is public.** `.pm/` is committed to a public repo. Write every board file for public consumption: no secrets or credentials, no user data, and no references to private repositories or their contents. Assume the community reads the board — it is itself an adoption surface.
- **Respect the anti-goals.** Read `.pm/DO_NOT_DO.md` before proposing or materializing work. Do not create milestones/tasks that conflict with it.
- **Workers are generalists.** A workstream is a worker queue, not a permanent topic, package, feature, or pillar lane. Keep workstream titles and provenance generic; put topic-specific scope in milestones, tasks, and inbox notes. Route new work by priority, dependencies, and available capacity, and allow one workstream to contain unrelated topics across A1/A2/A3.
- **Sizing rule.** A milestone must be **> ~1 hour of work across more than one task**. If a chunk is ≤ ~1h (tens of minutes, a task or two), do **NOT** create an `mN/` directory — record it as a loose inbox note `wN/NNN.md`. Tasks take tens of minutes; milestones take hours.
- **IDs must match the path.** A task's `id: wN/mN/tNNN` frontmatter must equal the directory it lives in. Never create a milestone dir whose path disagrees with the IDs inside it; if you find drift, flag and repair it, don't copy it.
- **Keep status in sync** across all three places it lives: the workstream `README.md` milestone checkbox, the milestone `README.md` `**Status:**` line + the `— DONE` marker in the task table, and each task's `status:` frontmatter.
- **Completed work must exit the open tree.** Moving completed work into `done/` is a mandatory exit condition, not optional cleanup. A mutating subcommand must not report success while an affected task with `status: done` remains at `wN/mN/tNNN.md`, or while an affected milestone with no open tasks remains at `wN/mN/`. Move completed tasks to `wN/mN/done/` and completed milestones to `wN/done/mN/`, then verify the old open paths no longer exist.
- **Numbering:** next free zero-padded 3-digit for inbox notes (`NNN`) and tasks (`tNNN`); next free `wN` / `mN`. Scan the tree first; don't reuse a number.
- Use `worker: worker1` unless the workstream README names another worker.
- **Milestones must be meaningful.** Every milestone must include direct pillar linkage (A1/A2/A3), an observable expected adoption outcome, and why this work matters now (dependency/risk/sequence rationale).
- **Every milestone ends with standing closing tasks**, appended after the implementation tasks whenever a milestone is materialized:

  1. **Adoption surface** — _only when the milestone ships something a user or a coding agent touches._ Check the shipped change is discoverable and usable on every surface it exposes: the owning package's `README.md` (install/quickstart steps still work exactly as written), the root `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` package tables, the `skills/CLAUDE.md` skills table for new or changed skills, and the `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/skills`, and `.agents/skills` symlinks (root `CLAUDE.md` compatibility rules). For agent-facing work, verify the behavior holds for both Claude Code and Codex — same instructions, same triggers. Flag drift as follow-up work rather than silently diverging. Omit this task only for milestones with no user- or agent-facing surface (pure infra, board mechanics, internal refactors) — note why it was omitted in the milestone's `## Source + Goal linkage`.
  2. **Simplify** — run `/simplify` over the code this milestone changed (reuse / simplification / efficiency; behavior-preserving).
  3. **Test coverage** — add meaningful tests for the behavior this milestone shipped. Tests must assert real behavior and failure modes; never game coverage with trivial, tautological, or snapshot-everything tests.
  4. **Closeout** — the final task, added last. When the milestone's other tasks are all complete **and its definition of done is actually met**, close the milestone: set every remaining task's `status: done`, move each `tNNN.md` to `wN/mN/done/`, mark every row `— **DONE**` and set `**Status:** done` in the milestone `README.md`, move the whole `wN/mN/` directory to `wN/done/mN/`, and check `- [x]` in the workstream `README.md`. Completing this task _is_ the move — running `/pm done <wN/mN/tNNN>` on it last triggers the milestone move (the `done` subcommand's step 4). Do **not** run it until the DoD holds: a milestone lands in `done/` when its observable end state is real, not merely when the code is written.

  Each `depends_on` the last implementation task(s) (Simplify and Test coverage depend on Adoption surface when it's present; Closeout depends on Test coverage) and all count toward the `(N tasks)` total. `add-task` inserts new work **before** these (before Closeout) and updates their `depends_on`.

## Subcommands

### `status` (default)

Read the tree (`find .pm -type f -name '*.md'`, skipping `done/`) and `.pm/DO_NOT_DO.md`. Print, per open workstream: its milestones with `**Status:**`, and the **next actionable task** per milestone — the first non-done task whose `depends_on` are all satisfied. Also list open inbox notes. Then run a lightweight validation pass and flag:

- items conflicting with `.pm/DO_NOT_DO.md`,
- milestones missing `## Source + Goal linkage` or a pillar (A1/A2/A3),
- milestones whose definition of done is vague/non-testable,
- completed tasks or milestones that still sit in the open tree instead of their applicable `done/` directory.

Touch no files.

### `new workstream <title>`

Create the next free `wN/` with `README.md` from the workstream template below. The title must describe a generic worker queue, not a topic specialty.

### `add <wN> <idea…>`

Create the next free inbox note `wN/NNN.md` with the idea as plain terse markdown (no frontmatter). This is the default home for **sub-hour** work.

### `promote <wN/NNN>` / `new milestone <wN> <title>`

Apply the **sizing rule first.**

- If the work is **> ~1h and splits into more than one task**: create `wN/mN/` with `README.md` (milestone template) + one `tNNN.md` per task (task template) **+ the standing closing tasks (Adoption surface when the milestone ships a user- or agent-facing change, then Simplify, then Test coverage, then Closeout)**, add the `- [ ] **mN** — …` line to the workstream `README.md`, and fill `## Source + Goal linkage` with source + pillar linkage + expected outcome + why-now rationale (note there why Adoption surface was included or omitted).
- If it is **≤ ~1h**: do NOT create a milestone. Keep/append it as an inbox note `wN/NNN.md` and tell the user why (too small for a milestone).

### `add-task <wN/mN> <title>`

Create the next `tNNN.md` from the task template and add its row to the milestone `README.md` table **before the standing closing tasks**, updating their `depends_on` to include it. Update the `(N tasks)` count in the workstream README.

### `done <wN/mN/tNNN>`

1. Set the task's frontmatter `status: done`.
2. In the milestone `README.md`: mark the row `— **DONE**` and update the `**Status:**` line (e.g. `todo (t001 done)`).
3. **Move** the file to `wN/mN/done/tNNN.md`.
4. If no open tasks remain in the milestone, **move the whole milestone** to `wN/done/mN/` and check its box (`- [x]`) in the workstream `README.md`.
5. **Verify the exit condition before returning:** the completed task exists only under `done/`; and, when no open tasks remain, the milestone exists only at `wN/done/mN/`, its `README.md` says `**Status:** done`, and the workstream checkbox is checked. Do not report success until these moves and status updates are complete.

Show the intended moves before mutating if the user passed `DRY_RUN=1`.
