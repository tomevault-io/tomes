name: beancount-migrate
description: Migrate transaction history from a personal-finance app export (Mint, Monarch, QuickBooks Online, Copilot, Bench handoff, or any category-tagged CSV export) into a new beancount ledger. Use this skill whenever the user has a full-history export from a finance app and wants out — "migrate me from Mint", "Monarch export to beancount", "my bookkeeping service shut down, here's the CSV", "convert my QuickBooks history to plain text". The skill proposes an account hierarchy from the export's categories, converts all history with transfer deduplication and opening balances, verifies counts and balances against the source, and ends with a running Fava. SKIP when the user wants to import an ongoing bank export into an existing ledger (beancount-import), reconcile against a statement (beancount-reconcile), start fresh with no history (beancount-init alone), or record individual transactions. The core trigger is "here is my old app's full export — turn it into a beancount ledger". Use when this capability is needed.

# beancount-migrate

Turn a finance-app export into a complete, verified beancount ledger — mapped accounts, full history, deduplicated transfers, opening balances, and a migration report that proves nothing was dropped.

This skill exists because every app shutdown (Mint, Bench, …) strands users with one CSV and no way to trust a conversion: categories don't map 1:1 to double-entry accounts, transfers appear twice (once per account), and a silently dropped row is invisible until a balance is wrong months later. The skill converts *with receipts*: every count and balance is reconciled against the source, and everything unmappable is surfaced, never guessed.

## Scope — what this skill does and does not touch

**Does:** convert one export (possibly covering many source accounts) into a fresh ledger; propose and confirm the account hierarchy before converting; pair transfers; construct opening balances; emit a migration report; run `bean-check`.

**Does not:** talk to any app's API (exports only); backfill investment lots/prices (holdings rows are surfaced as follow-up work, not converted); merge into an existing populated ledger (offer `beancount-import` for that); invent category mappings the user didn't confirm.

Read `references/mapping.md` before proposing any hierarchy, and the per-source reference (`references/mint.md`, `references/monarch.md`, `references/qbo.md`) before parsing. Unknown source? Inspect the header, then follow `mapping.md`'s generic path.

## Workflow

Six phases, in order: **Identify → Scaffold → Map → Convert → Verify → Report.**

### 1. Identify

Inspect the export's header row and a few data rows. Recognize the source (Mint / Monarch / QBO — see references) or fall back to the generic category-tagged-CSV path. Establish: the distinct **source accounts** in the file, the **distinct categories**, the **date range**, the **row count**, and the sign/type convention. Ask for anything ambiguous — never guess signs or dates.

Also ask up front for each source account's **current balance** (from the old app or the real bank) — opening balances depend on it (see mapping.md). If the user also knows the balance at the **start of the export period**, collect it: anchoring on a stated opening (instead of back-deriving one) makes the endpoint assertion a real check rather than a tautology.

### 2. Scaffold

If the working directory has no ledger, scaffold one via the **beancount-init** skill's flow (main.bean + Fava + uv + Makefile) — do not duplicate that logic here. Then **backdate the scaffold's today-dated `open` directives** to on/before the earliest migrated entry (migrated history posting to an account opened later fails `bean-check` with "reference to inactive account"). If a populated ledger already exists, stop: this skill targets fresh starts; offer `beancount-import` instead.

### 3. Map

Propose, then **confirm before converting**:

1. **Account mapping** — each source account → `Assets:…` or `Liabilities:…` (type from the source metadata or the user).
2. **Category mapping** — each distinct source category → an `Expenses:…` or `Income:…` account, as a reviewable table (`Groceries → Expenses:Food:Groceries`). Follow `references/mapping.md`'s shaping rules. Categories with no sensible mapping go to `Expenses:Uncategorized` — listed explicitly, never silently absorbed.
3. **Transfer categories** — which source categories mean "transfer between my own accounts" (e.g. Mint's `Transfer`, `Credit Card Payment`). These pair up, not double-book (mapping.md).

Present all three tables together as one review; the user edits them in place and a **single explicit yes** covers all three — only then does Convert run.

### 4. Convert

- One transaction per non-transfer row: source-account posting at the row amount (ledger sign), counter-account from the confirmed category mapping.
- **Transfer pairs** (same amount, opposite direction, ≤3 days apart, transfer-mapped categories, different source accounts) merge into **one** two-posting transaction. Unpaired transfer rows go to a `transfers to review` list, converted against `Equity:Transfers-Review` so totals still tie.
- Every entry carries `import-id` metadata per the `beancount-import` convention (`references/dedup.md` there): native row ID if the export has one, else `<source>:sha256:<16-hex>` with the same normalization. A merged transfer pair covers **two** source rows — record one row's id as `import-id` and the other as `import-id-2` so a later `beancount-import` of either account exact-matches its side and doesn't double-book the transfer.
- **Opening balances**: per account, `opening = stated current balance − Σ(converted rows)`, dated the day before the earliest row, posted against `Equity:Opening-Balances`. Then a `balance` assertion **dated the day after the last row** (beancount checks balances at start-of-date) pins the endpoint at the stated current balance.
- Write `open` directives for every mapped account, dated on or before the earliest entry.

### 5. Verify

Run the checks; a migration that can't show its math didn't happen:

- **Row count**: source rows = non-transfer transactions written + 2×(transfer pairs merged) + skipped rows (each listed with a reason) — a merged pair is 2 source rows but 1 transaction, so count it on the pairs side, not the transactions side.
- **Balances**: per account, opening + Σ(rows) must equal the stated current balance — this is what the appended `balance` assertion enforces via `bean-check`.
- **bean-check** on the ledger. Any failure: surface the exact output, do not report success.

If a stated balance and the computed sum disagree, the `balance` assertion will fail — **surface the delta and its likely causes** (rows missing from the export, pending transactions, wrong stated balance); never adjust numbers to force a pass, never delete the assertion to hide it. Offer the residual as an explicit `Equity:Migration-Residual` posting **only** if the user explicitly accepts the discrepancy.

### 6. Report

End with the migration report (also saved as `MIGRATION.md` in the repo if the user wants):

```
Source: Mint export, 2023-01-05 … 2026-07-15, 2 accounts, 1,214 rows
Converted: 1,180 transactions   Transfer pairs merged: 16 (32 rows)
Skipped: 2 rows (listed below, with reasons)
Unmapped categories → Expenses:Uncategorized: "Misc" (14 rows), "Stuff" (3 rows)
Balances: Assets:Bank:Checking ✓ ties to 3,412.55   Liabilities:CC:Amex ✓ ties to -210.40
bean-check: PASS
Next steps: refine Expenses:Uncategorized rows; run `make start` for Fava; use beancount-import for ongoing weekly imports.
```

## What NOT to do

- Don't convert before the account and category mappings are explicitly confirmed.
- Don't guess a mapping — unmapped means `Expenses:Uncategorized`, visibly reported.
- Don't double-book transfers, and don't silently drop unpaired transfer rows.
- Don't hide a count or balance delta — surface it; never force a tie-out.
- Don't convert investment holdings/lots — flag as follow-up.
- Don't write anything outside the fresh ledger repo (the user-approved beancount-init scaffold excepted), and no transactions before the mapping confirm.
