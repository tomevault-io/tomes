description: Autonomously work a `.pm` workstream to completion — pick the next pending milestone, implement every task end to end, ship it, then move to the next until none remain. Use when the user explicitly invokes $loop-worker or asks to loop, drain, or work through a whole workstream's backlog (e.g. `$loop-worker w1`). Sequential, not interval-based; do not use for a timed poll, a single task, or ordinary code edits. Use when this capability is needed.

# Task: Drain a `.pm` workstream milestone by milestone

Usage: `/loop-worker <wN>`

`/loop-worker <wN>` — repeatedly pick the next **pending** milestone in workstream `<wN>`, implement it fully, `/ship` it, and continue to the next, until the workstream has no pending milestones left (or a milestone genuinely blocks). This is a long-running autonomous loop over the `.pm` board; it composes `/pm` (the only writer to `.pm/`), your own implementation work, and `/ship`. It is sequential, not interval-based — for a timed poll use `/loop`.

Parse the target workstream from `$ARGUMENTS` (e.g. `w1`). If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, **STOP** and ask which workstream to drain — never guess.

## Preconditions (verify once, up front)

1. `git branch --show-current` is `main`. If not, STOP and ask (same rule as `/ship`).
2. `git status` — note pre-existing uncommitted changes. Do not sweep unrelated changes into a milestone's ship; if the tree is dirty with work you didn't do, surface it and ask before starting.
3. The workstream `.pm/<wN>/README.md` exists. If not, STOP and report.
4. Read `.pm/DO_NOT_DO.md` once. Every milestone you pick must respect it.

## The loop

Repeat until the exit condition below:

### 1. Pick the next pending milestone

Read `.pm/<wN>/README.md`. In the `## Milestones` list, pending milestones are the unchecked ones (`- [ ] **mN**`). Pick the **lowest-numbered** pending milestone that still has a live directory (`.pm/<wN>/mN/`, not under `.pm/<wN>/done/`). Cross-check by listing `.pm/<wN>/m*/` and `.pm/<wN>/done/` — the checkbox and the on-disk state must agree; if they disagree, trust the task files, flag the drift, and repair it through `/pm` before continuing.

Loose inbox notes (`.pm/<wN>/NNN.md`) are **not** work items for this loop — they are ideas or sub-hour units that nobody has committed to. Leave them alone and list them in the final summary.

If there are **no** pending milestones, go to **Exit**.

Announce which milestone you picked and give a one-line plan before doing work.

### 2. Understand the milestone

Read `.pm/<wN>/mN/README.md` and every open task file `.pm/<wN>/mN/tNNN.md` (skip any already in `.pm/<wN>/mN/done/`). These define the scope, order, `depends_on` graph, and acceptance. Milestones ship features **end to end** — include the dashboard/mobile tasks alongside the backend, CLI, and skills ones; do not stop at the API. Respect the milestone's `## Definition of done` and each task's `## Acceptance criteria`.

The last tasks of every milestone are the standing closing tasks defined in [`skills/.claude/skills/pm/SKILL.md`](../pm/SKILL.md) (Adoption surface when present, Simplify, Test coverage, Closeout). They are real work, not bookkeeping: run `/simplify` for Simplify, write meaningful tests for Test coverage, and walk every surface the Adoption surface task names.

### 3. Implement it

Do the actual engineering, task by task, following the `depends_on` order (the next actionable task is the first non-done task whose dependencies are all done):

- Follow all `CLAUDE.md` rules — root and the scoped `<package>/CLAUDE.md` for every package you touch (lockfiles are never hand-edited, changes stay scoped to one package, `cd` into the package before running its scripts, no secrets, `AGENTS.md` symlinks stay in sync with `CLAUDE.md`).
- Run the checks the change touches and make them pass before considering a task done:
  - `dashboard/` → `yarn format:check`, `yarn lint`, `yarn test`, `yarn build`
  - `mobile/` → `yarn format:check`, `yarn lint`, `yarn typecheck`, `yarn test:unit`
  - `cli/` → `make check-all`
  - `skills/` → `python3 skills/scripts/ci-check.py` (from the repo root)
  - `backend-cluster/*`, `deploy/` → the commands in that package's scoped `CLAUDE.md`
  - any `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / skill change → `python3 scripts/check-agent-guidance.py` (from the repo root)
  - before every ship → `gitleaks dir . --redact --verbose`

  Never mark a task complete on unverified code.

- You may delegate independent sub-tasks to subagents (Agent tool) to parallelize, but you own correctness.
- Keep the board in sync as you finish tasks by invoking **`/pm done <wN/mN/tNNN>`** for each completed task — `/pm` is the only skill that writes to `.pm/`, so never edit task frontmatter, milestone `**Status:**` lines, or workstream checkboxes by hand. Running `/pm done` on the milestone's Closeout task last is what moves the whole milestone to `.pm/<wN>/done/mN/` and flips its workstream checkbox to `[x]`. Do not close out until the milestone's definition of done actually holds.

### 4. Ship it

Invoke **`/ship`** ([`skills/.claude/skills/ship/SKILL.md`](../ship/SKILL.md)) for this milestone's changes — code and the `.pm/` moves together. Because you made the changes this session, `/ship` runs session-aware: it stages exactly what you touched and writes the commit message from your knowledge. `/ship` ends at a successful push — it has no test gate of its own and does not watch CI, so the checks in step 3 are the only gate; run them before invoking it. **Do not proceed to the next milestone until `/ship` reports the shipped HEAD.**

If `/ship` surfaces a failure it cannot fix (rebase conflict it can't resolve, rejected push), treat it as a **block** (see below).

### 5. Continue

Loop back to step 1 to pick the next pending milestone.

## Exit

Stop the loop and give a final summary when any of these holds:

- **Done:** no pending milestones remain in `<wN>`. Report which milestones you shipped this run (with their HEAD SHAs) and any open inbox notes left in the workstream.
- **Blocked:** a milestone needs a decision only the user can make (ambiguous scope, a `DO_NOT_DO.md` conflict, an external credential/access you lack, a definition of done that cannot be observed from this repo, or a ship failure you can't resolve). Stop **before** shipping half-work — report the exact blocker and what you'd need to proceed. Do not skip a blocked milestone to grab a later one unless the user says so.
- **Budget/interrupt:** the user interrupts, or you've been running long enough that a checkpoint is warranted — report progress (shipped, in-flight, remaining) so the run can be resumed cleanly.

## Guardrails

- **One milestone per ship.** Never batch two milestones into one commit; each milestone lands as its own shipped unit so history and rollback stay clean.
- **Never ship red.** A failing check is a block, not a footnote. `/ship` will not stop you — the step 3 checks are the gate, so run them yourself before every ship.
- **`/pm` owns the board.** All `.pm/` writes go through `/pm done`; a milestone is done when it sits under `.pm/<wN>/done/mN/`, not when the code is written.
- **The board is public.** Nothing you write into `.pm/` or a commit may contain secrets, user data, or references to private repositories.
- **Stay in `<wN>`.** Only pick milestones from the requested workstream. Workers are general-purpose, but this run is scoped to the queue the user named.
- **Report honestly.** If you skipped a task, mocked something, or a suite was flaky, say so in the per-milestone summary — don't present partial work as complete.
