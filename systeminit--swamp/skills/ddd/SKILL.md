# Domain Driven Design

Apply these patterns when implementing domain logic in TypeScript/Deno.

## Building Block Selection

Choose the appropriate type based on these criteria:

| Type                    | Identity                 | Mutability              | When to Use                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Value Object**        | None (equality by value) | Immutable               | Measurements, descriptions, identifiers, money, dates, addresses                                                                                                        |
| **Entity**              | Has unique ID            | Mutable                 | Things with lifecycle, tracked over time, referenced by ID                                                                                                              |
| **Aggregate**           | Root entity + children   | Root controls mutations | Consistency boundary, transactional unit, enforce invariants                                                                                                            |
| **Domain Service**      | None                     | Stateless               | Operations spanning multiple aggregates, external integrations                                                                                                          |
| **Repository**          | None                     | Stateless               | Persistence abstraction for aggregates only                                                                                                                             |
| **Application Service** | None                     | Stateless               | Orchestrate domain objects for a use case; own the transaction boundary; return results or emit progress events; live in the application/libswamp layer, not the domain |

### Quick Decision Flow

```
Does it have a unique identity that matters?
├─ No → Value Object
└─ Yes → Does it enforce invariants over child objects?
         ├─ Yes → Aggregate Root
         └─ No → Entity (likely part of an aggregate)

Does it orchestrate multiple domain objects for a use case?
└─ Yes → Application Service (lives in the application/libswamp layer)
```

## TypeScript Patterns

See [references/patterns.md](references/patterns.md) for implementation
examples.

## Ubiquitous Language

Update the project's ubiquitous language glossary when:

- **New domain concept** introduced (add term + definition)
- **Meaning clarified** through discussion (refine definition)
- **Naming conflicts** discovered (resolve and document)
- **Bounded context boundary** identified (note context for term)

Location: Document terms in code via types/interfaces. Add non-obvious terms to
project documentation.

### Naming Rules

- Use domain expert terminology, not technical jargon
- Prefer nouns for entities/value objects: `Order`, `Money`, `Address`
- Prefer verbs for domain services: `PricingService`, `ShippingCalculator`
- Name aggregates by their root: `Order` (not `OrderAggregate`)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Anemic domain model**: Entities with only getters/setters, logic in services
- **God aggregate**: Too many entities under one root (split by invariant
  boundary)
- **Repository per entity**: Only aggregate roots get repositories
- **Leaking persistence**: Domain objects should not know about storage
