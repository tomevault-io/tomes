A reference for metadata optimization, keyword strategy, and review guidelines that the store-manager agent uses during app store deployment.

## Target Agent

`store-manager` — Applies this skill's ASO strategies and guidelines directly to store deployment preparation.

## Metadata Optimization Matrix

### App Store (iOS) vs Google Play

| Field | App Store | Google Play | ASO Impact |
|-------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **App Name** | 30 chars | 30 chars | Highest |
| **Subtitle** | 30 chars | N/A | High (iOS) |
| **Keywords** | 100 chars (hidden field) | N/A (extracted from description) | High |
| **Short Description** | N/A | 80 chars | High (Android) |
| **Long Description** | 4,000 chars | 4,000 chars | Medium (High for Android) |
| **Screenshots** | Up to 10 | Up to 8 | High |
| **Preview Video** | 30 sec, up to 3 | 30 sec-2 min, 1 | Medium |
| **Category** | Primary + Secondary | 1 | Medium |

## Keyword Strategy

### Keyword Selection Process
1. **Seed Keywords**: Extract from app core features (5-10)
2. **Expanded Keywords**: Synonyms, related terms, long-tail (20-30)
3. **Competitive Analysis**: Check competitor app keywords
4. **Filtering**: Prioritize by search volume + difficulty + relevance
5. **Placement**: Priority order: title > subtitle > keyword field > description

### iOS Keyword Field Optimization (100 chars)
- Separate with commas, no spaces
- Do not duplicate words already in app name/subtitle (waste)
- Singular form only (plural auto-matched)
- Exclude articles and prepositions
- Example: `todo,task,schedule,checklist,memo,plan,productivity,habit,routine,reminder`

### Google Play Description Optimization
- First 5 lines are key (before fold)
- Naturally repeat keywords 3-5 times
- List features with bullet points
- Include CTA ("Download now")

## Screenshot Guidelines

### Size Specifications
| Device | App Store (px) | Google Play (px) |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| iPhone 6.7" | 1290 x 2796 | - |
| iPhone 6.5" | 1284 x 2778 | - |
| iPad 12.9" | 2048 x 2732 | - |
| Android Phone | - | 1080 x 1920 (16:9) |
| Android Tablet | - | 1200 x 1920 |

### Screenshot Content Strategy
| Order | Content | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 1st | Core value proposition (hero) | "Why do you need this app" |
| 2nd | Core Feature #1 | Most-used feature |
| 3rd | Core Feature #2 | Differentiating feature |
| 4th | Core Feature #3 | Additional feature |
| 5th | Social proof | Awards, ratings, press |

### Screenshot Design Principles
- Caption text within 20-30 characters
- Text top / app screen bottom layout (or reverse)
- Consistent color theme (brand colors)
- Device frame optional (trend: frameless)
- Show realistic data in app UI (no Lorem ipsum)

## Major Review Rejection Reasons & Responses

### App Store (Apple) Top Rejection Reasons

| Rank | Guideline | Reason | Response |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | 4.0 Design | Bugs, crashes, incomplete features | Fully test all features before submission |
| 2 | 2.1 Performance | Insufficient app completeness | Even MVP must have fully working core flow |
| 3 | 4.3 Spam | Duplicate of existing app | Clearly describe differentiators |
| 4 | 5.1.1 Data Collection | Privacy collection not explained | Privacy Policy + purpose disclosure |
| 5 | 3.1.1 In-App Purchase | Non-IAP payment used | Digital content must use IAP |
| 6 | 2.5.1 Software Requirements | Private API usage | Use only public APIs |

### Google Play Top Rejection Reasons

| Reason | Response |
|--------|---------|
| Crashes/ANR | Test automation, crash reporting |
| Excessive permission requests | Minimum permission principle, request at point of use |
| Incomplete Data Safety section | Accurately fill Data Safety Form |
| Target age not set | Clearly specify children targeting |
| IP infringement | Do not use third-party logos/names without permission |

## App Description Writing Formula

### Structure
```
[Headline: One sentence core value]

[3-5 core feature bullets]

[Social proof: Download count, ratings, awards]

[Detailed feature description]

[CTA: Download now]

[Natural keyword insertion area]
```

## Category Selection Guide

| App Type | Recommended iOS Category | Recommended Google Play Category |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| To-do/Productivity | Productivity | Productivity |
| Social/Community | Social Networking | Social |
| Shopping | Shopping | Shopping |
| Health/Fitness | Health & Fitness | Health & Fitness |
| Education | Education | Education |
| Finance | Finance | Finance |
| Utilities | Utilities | Tools |
| Food Delivery | Food & Drink | Food & Drink |

### Category Strategy
- Primary category: Most accurate classification (search visibility priority)
- Secondary category (iOS): Additional exposure opportunity → choose lower-competition category
- Category rank matters more than overall rank

## Release Notes Writing Guide

| Item | Rule |
|------|------|
| Length | 3-5 lines (considering user read rate) |
| Structure | New features > Improvements > Bug fixes |
| Tone | Friendly and clear (avoid jargon) |
| Emojis | Moderate (1-2, for category separation) |
| Keywords | Naturally include key keywords (ASO) |
