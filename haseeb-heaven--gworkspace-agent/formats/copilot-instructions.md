## Project Overview

**GWorkspace Agent** is a LangGraph-powered AI assistant for Google Workspace. It accepts natural language commands and translates them into Google Workspace API calls (Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Meet, Chat) using a multi-agent planning and execution pipeline.

- **Language:** Python 3.11
- **Core Framework:** LangGraph + LangChain
- **LLM Backend:** OpenAI-compatible API (configurable via `LLM_PROVIDER` / `LLM_MODEL`)
- **Interfaces:** CLI, Desktop GUI (Tkinter), Web UI (Gradio), Telegram Bot, Cloud Run (REST)
- **Deployment:** Google Cloud Run via Docker
- **Package root:** `gws_assistant/`

---

## Testing Instructions

The CI plan lives in `.github/workflows/pipeline.yml`. All checks must pass before a PR is merged.

```bash
# Run unit tests (safe for CI — no GWS binary needed)
pytest tests/ \
  -m "not live_integration" \
  --ignore=tests/manual \
  --ignore=tests/test_live_integration.py \
  --cov=gws_assistant \
  --cov-fail-under=70 \
  -v

# Run integration tests (mocked GWS)
pytest tests/test_integration.py \
  -m "not live_integration" \
  --cov=gws_assistant.langgraph_workflow \
  --cov=gws_assistant.execution \
  --cov-fail-under=65 \
  -v

# Run live integration tests (requires real GWS binary + credentials)
pytest tests/test_live_integration.py -m live_integration -v
```

### Test Structure

```
tests/
├── test_unit_*.py           # Unit tests — fully mocked, no GWS binary needed
├── test_integration.py      # Integration tests — mocked GWS, real LangGraph workflow
├── test_hardening_policy.py # Security/hardening policy tests
├── test_live_integration.py # Live tests — requires real credentials
└── manual/                  # Manual scripts — excluded from CI
```

### Testing Conventions

- Fix failing tests by correcting **source code**, never by modifying test assertions
- Coverage thresholds are enforced: unit ≥ 70%, integration ≥ 65% — do not lower them
- Tag live tests with `@pytest.mark.live_integration`
- Do not hardcode `CI=true` inside tests; use `monkeypatch.setenv` / `monkeypatch.delenv`
- Tests that exercise non-CI validation must explicitly unset CI: `monkeypatch.delenv("CI", raising=False)`
- Add or update tests for every code change, even if not requested

---

## Code Style Guidelines

```bash
# Lint (must pass with zero errors)
ruff check .

# Type check
mypy gws_assistant --ignore-missing-imports

# Auto-fix safe lint issues
ruff check . --fix
```

- Follow PEP 8 with a 100-character line limit
- All public functions and classes must have docstrings
- Use type annotations on all function signatures
- Inter-agent data must use Pydantic models from `models.py` — never pass raw `dict` between layers
- Return type from any tool wrapper must be `ToolResult` (defined in `models.py`)

---

## Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental commits of secret files (`.env`, `secrets*.json`, etc.) and to enforce code quality.

### Installation

```bash
# After installing dependencies from requirements.txt
pre-commit install
```

### What It Blocks

The pre-commit configuration (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) includes:

- **Secret file detection**: Blocks commits containing `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.*.local`, `secrets*.json`, `credentials`, `api_keys`, and other secret files
- **Basic formatting**: YAML/JSON validation, trailing whitespace, end-of-file fixer
- **Private key detection**: Detects private keys in code

### Running Hooks Manually

```bash
# Run on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run on staged files only
pre-commit run
```

### Bypassing Hooks (Not Recommended)

If you must bypass hooks (use with extreme caution):

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "your message"
```

**Never bypass hooks to commit `.env` or secrets files.**

## Architecture: Core Components

### Planner (`planner.py`)
Receives a parsed `Intent` and returns an ordered `List[PlanStep]`. Each step maps exactly to a tool registered in `service_catalog.py`. Do not reference tool names that are not in the catalog.

### Executor — LangGraph Workflow (`langgraph_workflow.py`)
State machine with nodes: `parse_intent → plan → execute_step → verify → respond`. Uses `llm_client.py` with automatic fallback via `model_registry.py`.

### Executor — LangChain ReAct (`langchain_agent.py`)
Alternative backend activated when `USE_LANGCHAIN=true`. Dynamically loads tools from `gws_assistant/tools/` and integrates `memory.py`.

### Verification Engine (`verification_engine.py`)
Post-execution validator. Input: `Intent + List[ToolResult]`. Output: `VerificationResult` (passed / failed / needs_retry). Triggers re-planning on failure.

### Safety Guard (`safety_guard.py`)
Pre-execution safety layer. Must be consulted before any destructive GWS operation. Outputs `SafetyDecision` (allow / block / require_confirmation). The risk policy matrix must not be weakened without explicit project owner approval.

### Service Catalog (`service_catalog.py`)
Registers all 60+ GWS tools with `name`, `description`, `parameters` (JSON Schema), and `required` fields. **When adding a new GWS capability, register it here first.** The Planner will not use an unregistered tool.

### GWS Runner (`gws_runner.py`)
Subprocess wrapper for the GWS CLI binary. Binary path comes from `GWS_BINARY_PATH`. When `CI=true`, the `is_file()` check is skipped — this bypass is required for CI and must not be removed.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

**File:** `.github/workflows/pipeline.yml`

### Job Execution Order

```
lint → unit-tests → integration-tests → security
                                              ↓
                                       review-guard
                                    (blocks on unresolved
                                      review threads)
                                              ↓ safe_to_merge == true
                                         auto-merge
                                              ↓ on any failure
                                        ci-auto-fix
```

### Auto-Merge
- Squash-merges into the **PR’s actual base branch** (`github.event.pull_request.base.ref`)
- Branch is deleted after merge
- Do not hardcode `main` or `master` as a merge target anywhere in the pipeline

### Review Guard
- Queries all review threads via GraphQL
- Blocks merge if any thread is unresolved and non-outdated
- Posts detailed unresolved comment context to the linked Issue

### CI Failure Auto-Fix
- Triggers on any job failure in a PR
- Posts full error logs and instructions to the linked Issue (or PR if no Issue found)
- **Agent must push fixes to the same head branch — never open a new PR or merge manually**

### Security Scan
- Runs `bandit` (Python code security), `safety` (dependency vulnerabilities), and `pip-audit` (CVE scan)
- Snyk SCA (Software Composition Analysis) and SAST (Static Application Security Testing) if SNYK_TOKEN is configured
- Security findings are uploaded as artifacts for review
- **IMPORTANT:** Security scans now fail the pipeline on HIGH/CRITICAL findings
- **Exception:** Snyk SCA is allowed to fail for third-party vulnerabilities with no available fixes (already reviewed and dismissed)

---

## PR & Commit Instructions

- **Commit format:** `<type>(<scope>): <short description>` — e.g. `fix(planner): handle empty intent`, `feat(tools): add Sheets append tool`
- **PR title:** mirror the primary commit message
- **Branch naming:**
  - `feature/<short-description>` for new features
  - `fix/<short-description>` for bug fixes
  - `hotfix/<short-description>` for urgent production fixes
- Always run `ruff check .` and the unit test suite before pushing
- Do not open a new PR to fix a failing one — push to the existing branch; CI will auto-merge once green
- Do not merge manually — CI handles all merges

---

## Custom Skills

The following custom agent skills are installed in the `skills/` directory and can be used to automate PR/MR workflows:

- **`check-pr`**: Audits a Pull Request (GitHub), Merge Request (GitLab), or Changelist (Perforce) for unresolved comments, failing status checks, and incomplete descriptions.
- **`greploop`**: An iterative review and fix loop that triggers Greptile reviews and addresses feedback until a 5/5 confidence score is achieved.

To use these skills, read the instructions in `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.

---

## What an Agent Can Do

- Fix failing tests by correcting source code in `gws_assistant/`
- Add new GWS tools by updating `service_catalog.py` and adding a wrapper in `gws_assistant/tools/`
- Update `models.py` to add or extend Pydantic models
- Fix lint (`ruff`) and type (`mypy`) errors
- Add new test cases to existing test files
- Update `requirements.txt` for new dependencies
- Refactor modules within `gws_assistant/` following existing patterns
- Improve docstrings and inline comments
- Update this file (`AGENTS.md`) when architecture or conventions change

### 🚫 Agent Safety & Integrity Rules (Python Projects)

#### 1. Testing & Quality Assurance
- Never modify or weaken test assertions to force passing results
- Do not reduce code coverage thresholds under any circumstances
- Avoid skipping, mocking, or bypassing critical test paths unless explicitly approved
- Ensure all changes maintain or improve existing test reliability

#### 2. Security & Secrets Management
- Never hardcode credentials, API keys, tokens, or secrets in source code
- Do not commit `.env`, `secrets.json`, or any sensitive configuration files
- Never expose environment variables in logs, outputs, or error messages
- Use secure configuration management (e.g., environment variables, secret managers)

#### 3. Core Safety Mechanisms
- Do not remove, weaken, or bypass rules in `safety_guard.py`
- Maintain all risk policies and validation checks intact
- Any change affecting safety logic must be explicitly reviewed and justified

#### 4. CI/CD Discipline
- Never manually merge pull requests — CI pipeline owns all merges
- Do not resolve review comments manually without fixing underlying code issues
- Avoid introducing CI bypasses or conditional shortcuts that skip validation
- Preserve all pipeline safeguards and verification steps

#### 5. Configuration Integrity
- Do not modify critical infrastructure variables:
  - `GCP_PROJECT_ID`
  - `GCP_REGION`
  - `GCP_SERVICE`
- Do not remove or alter CI mode conditions such as:
  - `if not ci_mode`
- Avoid hardcoding branch names like `main` or `master`; always use dynamic references (e.g., `base.ref`)

#### 6. Architecture & Data Contracts
- Never pass raw `dict` objects across layers
- Always use typed schemas (Pydantic models) for:
  - Validation
  - Serialization
  - Inter-layer communication
- Maintain strict typing and schema consistency across services

#### 7. Repository Hygiene
- Do not delete or modify `.env` files within the repository
- Ensure `.gitignore` properly excludes sensitive files
- Prevent accidental commits of generated or local configuration artifacts

#### 8. Code Integrity Principles
- Do not introduce hacks, shortcuts, or temporary fixes that bypass system design
- Preserve modular architecture and separation of concerns
- Maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly breaking changes are approved
- Ensure logging, error handling, and observability remain intact

## Security Considerations

- Never log full email bodies, file contents, or user PII
- `bandit`, `safety`, and `pip-audit` run on every PR — fix all HIGH severity findings before pushing
- Security scans now fail the pipeline on HIGH/CRITICAL findings (non-blocking mode removed)
- Snyk SAST (code security) runs on every PR and blocks merge on HIGH severity findings
- Snyk SCA (dependency scan) runs on every PR but is allowed to fail for third-party vulnerabilities with no available fixes (e.g. gradio, litellm)
- Secrets live in GitHub Actions Secrets only — never in committed `.env` files
- `.env.example` documents required keys but contains no real values
- The `safety_guard.py` policy matrix is the authoritative source for what operations are allowed without user confirmation
- Pre-commit hooks block commits of `.env` and secret files

---

## Branch Strategy

```
main        ← production branch (Cloud Run deploy triggers on push)
develop     ← integration branch (most PRs target this)
feature/**  ← feature development
hotfix/**   ← urgent production fixes
```
