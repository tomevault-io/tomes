## Prerequisites

- CLI installed from the desktop app. The command is `heptabase` on macOS/Linux; Windows installs `heptabase.cmd` for cmd/PowerShell and a `heptabase` shim for POSIX shells.
- Check version compatibility before use with `heptabase --version`. If the installed CLI version is outside this skill's compatibility range (`0.4.x`), you MUST stop and ask the user to update either the Heptabase desktop app or this skill package before continuing.

## Command discovery

Run `heptabase help` to see all available top-level commands. This is always up to date. Each command supports `--help` for detailed usage:

```bash
heptabase help
heptabase note --help
heptabase note create --help
```

## Common recipes

Use these as quick recipes for frequent requests. For less common flags or if a command fails, run `heptabase help` or `<command> --help` to discover the correct syntax.

- **Recent cards:** `heptabase card list --sort createdTime --direction descending --limit 20`
- **Today's journal:** `heptabase journal read $(date +%Y-%m-%d)`
- **Search cards by keyword:** `heptabase card list -q "<keyword>" --limit 20`
- **Create a note from markdown:** `heptabase note create --content "# Title\n\nBody"`.
- **Append markdown to a note:** `heptabase note append <cardId> --content "More content"`.
- **Edit note content with JSON save:** first read `references/card-content-schema.md`, then use `heptabase note read <cardId>`, modify the returned ProseMirror JSON, and save with `heptabase note save <cardId> --content-md5 <contentMd5> --content-file <path>`.
- **List tag properties:** `heptabase tag properties <tagId>`
- **List cards with property values:** `heptabase tag cards <tagId> --include-properties`
- **Read card properties:** `heptabase card properties <cardIdOrDate>`
- **Set card property:** first read `references/property-values.md`, then use `heptabase card set-property <cardIdOrDate> --property-id <propertyId> --value "Published"` for strings/options or `--json-value ...` for typed JSON values.
- **Read parsed PDF content:** first read `references/pdf-reading.md`, then use `heptabase pdf metadata <pdfCardId>` to discover `totalPages`, and read a page range with `heptabase pdf read <pdfCardId> --start-page N --end-page N`.
- **Read transcript content:** first read `references/transcript-reading.md`, then use `heptabase audio metadata <audioCardId>` or `heptabase video metadata <videoCardId>` to discover `transcriptStatus` and `durationSeconds`, and read overlapping transcript entries in a time range with `heptabase audio read <audioCardId> --start-seconds 0 --end-seconds 300` or `heptabase video read <videoCardId> --start-seconds 0 --end-seconds 300`.
- **Read a file from a PDF/media card:** first read `references/file-reading.md`, then use `heptabase file list --card-id <cardId>` to find the right file `id`, run `mktemp -d`, and pass the returned directory path to `heptabase file export <fileId> --output-dir <scratchDir>`. Read the returned `path` with your native file-reading tool.
- **Read a file by `fileId`:** first read `references/file-reading.md`, then run `mktemp -d` and pass the returned directory path to `heptabase file export <fileId> --output-dir <scratchDir>`. Read the returned `path` with your native file-reading tool.
- **List cards on a whiteboard:** `heptabase whiteboard cards <whiteboardId>`
- **Add a card to a whiteboard:** `heptabase whiteboard add-card --whiteboard-id <whiteboardId> --card-id <cardIdOrDate>`

## Note and journal card content editing

Use `create` / `append` with Markdown for ordinary writing. Before calling `heptabase note save` / `heptabase journal save` with ProseMirror JSON, you MUST read `references/card-content-schema.md`. Also read it before generating Markdown that uses Heptabase-specific extensions such as card mentions, whiteboard mentions, dates, videos, math, or toggle/todo lists.

## Property editing

Before setting a property value, you MUST read `references/property-values.md` and inspect the target property with `heptabase card properties <cardIdOrDate>` and/or `heptabase tag properties <tagId>`. Property formats vary by type, and relation writes replace the full relation value. For relation properties, use `heptabase tag properties <sourceTagId>` to get the property definition's `relationTargetTagId`, then list valid related cards before writing.

## File reading

Before reading/listing files or exporting a file, you MUST read `references/file-reading.md`.

## PDF reading

Before reading parsed PDF content, you MUST read `references/pdf-reading.md`.

## Transcript reading

Before reading parsed media transcripts, you MUST read `references/transcript-reading.md`.

## All output is JSON

Every command prints JSON to stdout. You can parse it with `jq` or pipe it to other tools.

## Troubleshooting

- **Desktop app must be running.** The CLI communicates with a local server inside the app. If the app is closed, all commands fail. Run `heptabase start` to launch and wait for readiness.
- **Codex sandbox may block the local CLI server.** If Heptabase starts but Codex says the CLI server is not ready, read `references/codex-sandbox.md`; retry `heptabase` commands outside the sandbox when Codex supports escalation.
- **Mutations are serialized.** Write operations (create, save, append, trash, restore, tag add/remove, card set-property, file export, whiteboard add-card/remove-card) run one at a time to prevent conflicts. Reads are concurrent.
- **Request body size limit.** The server rejects request bodies larger than 1 MB.
- **Request timeout.** The server times out requests that take longer than 10 seconds to send their body.

## Known limitations

- **Auto-enabling local server/CLI install not supported.** If the local CLI server is disabled or CLI wiring is missing, the skill cannot repair it by itself; ask the user to enable Local CLI Server and CLI install from desktop settings first.
- **File export is local-file-only.** `heptabase file export` works only when the file metadata and raw file are already available locally in the desktop app. It does not download missing files from cloud storage.
- **Binary/media upload workflows not supported.** This skill is for JSON/text operations on notes/journals/tags/cards and AI Tutor reads, not file upload or media-processing APIs.
- **Whiteboard creation/edit/delete not supported yet.** You can list whiteboards and add, list, or remove cards on them, but you can't create, rename, move, or delete whiteboards.
- **Property filtering not supported yet.** You can read tag property schemas, read property values, and set one property value on a card, but you can't query cards by property value.

## Warnings

- **Use the CLI as the only data access path.** Never directly read, write, or modify Heptabase app data through local database files, app storage, cache files, internal endpoints, or any other non-CLI mechanism. If the CLI does not support the requested operation, stop and report that it is not supported.
