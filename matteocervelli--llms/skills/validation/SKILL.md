# Feature Validation Skill

## Purpose

This skill provides systematic validation of implemented features, ensuring code quality, test coverage, performance, security, and requirement fulfillment before marking work complete.

## When to Use

- After implementation and testing are complete
- Before creating pull request
- Before marking feature as done
- When verifying all acceptance criteria met
- Final quality gate before deployment

## Validation Workflow

### 1. Code Quality Validation

**Run Quality Checks:**
```bash
# Format check (Black)
black --check src/ tests/

# Type checking (mypy)
mypy src/

# Linting (flake8, if configured)
flake8 src/ tests/

# All checks together
make lint  # If Makefile configured
```

**Quality Checklist:**
Refer to `quality-checklist.md` for comprehensive review

**Key Quality Metrics:**
- [ ] All functions have type hints
- [ ] All public functions have docstrings (Google style)
- [ ] No files exceed 500 lines
- [ ] No lint errors or warnings
- [ ] Code formatted with Black
- [ ] Type checking passes with mypy
- [ ] No code duplication (DRY principle)
- [ ] Single responsibility principle followed

**Automated Script:**
```bash
# Use validation script
python scripts/run_checks.py --quality
```

**Deliverable:** Quality report with pass/fail

---

### 2. Test Coverage Validation

**Run Tests with Coverage:**
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing

# Check coverage threshold
pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=80

# View HTML coverage report
open htmlcov/index.html
```

**Coverage Checklist:**
- [ ] Overall coverage ≥ 80%
- [ ] Core business logic ≥ 90%
- [ ] Utilities and helpers ≥ 85%
- [ ] No critical paths untested
- [ ] All branches covered
- [ ] Edge cases tested
- [ ] Error conditions tested

**Identify Coverage Gaps:**
```bash
# Show untested lines
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Generate detailed HTML report
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

**Deliverable:** Coverage report with gaps identified

---

### 3. Test Quality Validation

**Review Test Suite:**
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No skipped tests (without justification)
- [ ] No flaky tests (intermittent failures)
- [ ] Tests run quickly (unit tests < 1 min)
- [ ] Tests are independent (no order dependency)
- [ ] Tests clean up after themselves
- [ ] Mock external dependencies properly
- [ ] Test names are clear and descriptive

**Run Tests Multiple Times:**
```bash
# Run tests 10 times to check for flaky tests
for i in {1..10}; do pytest || break; done

# Run in random order
pytest --random-order
```

**Test Markers:**
```bash
# Verify no slow tests in unit tests
pytest tests/unit/ -m "not slow"

# Run integration tests separately
pytest tests/integration/
```

**Deliverable:** Test quality assessment

---

### 4. Performance Validation

**Performance Checklist:**
Refer to `performance-benchmarks.md` for target metrics

**Key Performance Metrics:**
- [ ] Response time < target (e.g., < 200ms for p95)
- [ ] Throughput meets requirements (e.g., 1000 req/s)
- [ ] Memory usage within bounds (e.g., < 100MB)
- [ ] CPU usage reasonable (e.g., < 50%)
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] Database queries optimized (< 5 queries per operation)

**Performance Testing:**
```bash
# Run performance tests
pytest tests/performance/ -v

# Profile code
python -m cProfile -o profile.stats script.py
python -m pstats profile.stats

# Memory profiling
python -m memory_profiler script.py
```

**Benchmark Against Requirements:**
```python
# Example performance test
def test_performance_requirement():
    """Verify operation meets performance requirement."""
    start = time.time()
    result = expensive_operation()
    duration = time.time() - start

    assert duration < 1.0, f"Took {duration}s, required < 1.0s"
```

**Deliverable:** Performance report with metrics

---

### 5. Security Validation

**Security Checklist Review:**
Review `security-checklist.md` from analysis phase and verify:

**Input Validation:**
- [ ] All user inputs validated and sanitized
- [ ] SQL injection prevented (parameterized queries)
- [ ] Command injection prevented (no shell=True with user input)
- [ ] Path traversal prevented (sanitized file paths)
- [ ] XSS prevented (escaped output)

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- [ ] Authentication required for protected endpoints
- [ ] Authorization checks at every access point
- [ ] Session management secure
- [ ] Credentials not hardcoded

**Data Protection:**
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted in transit
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted at rest (if applicable)
- [ ] PII handling compliant
- [ ] Secrets in environment variables (not code)
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info

**Dependency Security:**
```bash
# Check for vulnerable dependencies
pip-audit

# Or use safety
safety check --json

# Check for outdated dependencies
pip list --outdated
```

**Deliverable:** Security validation report
