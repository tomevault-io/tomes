# Pull Request Creator Skill

## Purpose

This skill provides systematic guidance for creating high-quality pull requests with comprehensive descriptions, proper commit messages, and complete test plans following conventional commits and project standards.

## When to Use

- After implementation, validation, documentation, and CHANGELOG updates
- Ready to create pull request for code review
- Need comprehensive PR description
- Following git workflow best practices
- Ensuring PR quality standards

## PR Creation Workflow

### 1. Pre-Flight Checks

**Objective**: Verify everything is ready for PR creation.

**Checklist**:
```bash
# 1. All changes committed
git status
# Should show: "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

# 2. All tests passing
pytest
# All tests should be green

# 3. Code quality checks passed
black src/ tests/ --check
mypy src/
# Should have no errors

# 4. Documentation updated
# Verify docs/ has implementation docs
ls docs/implementation/

# 5. CHANGELOG updated
# Verify CHANGELOG.md has new entry
head -50 CHANGELOG.md

# 6. Version numbers synced
grep -r "version.*=.*[0-9]" pyproject.toml src/__init__.py
# Should all show same version

# 7. No merge conflicts with main
git fetch origin main
git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main HEAD
# Exit code 0 means no conflicts
```

**If any check fails**:
- Fix the issue before proceeding
- Re-run checks until all pass
- Don't create PR with failing checks

**Deliverable**: All pre-flight checks passed

---

### 2. Review Changes

**Objective**: Understand full scope of changes for PR description.

**Review commit history**:
```bash
# View all commits in feature branch
git log --oneline main..HEAD

# View detailed commit messages
git log main..HEAD

# View files changed
git diff --stat main..HEAD

# View actual changes
git diff main..HEAD
```

**Analyze changes**:
- What was implemented?
- What files were modified/added?
- Are there breaking changes?
- What tests were added?
- What documentation was updated?

**Review validation results**:
- Test coverage percentage
- Performance benchmark results
- Security scan results
- Code quality metrics

**Deliverable**: Complete understanding of changes

---

### 3. Create Comprehensive Commit

**Objective**: Create commit with full feature changes and proper message.

**Commit Message Format** (Conventional Commits):
```
<type>: <short summary> (#<issue>)

<detailed description>

<body paragraphs>

<footers>

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Commit Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style/formatting
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Build, dependencies, configs

**Example Commit Message**:
```
feat: implement user authentication system (#123)

Implement comprehensive user authentication with JWT tokens,
OAuth providers, and session management. Includes password
reset flow, email verification, and role-based access control.

Implementation:
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Support for email/password and OAuth (Google, GitHub)
- Session management with configurable timeout
- Password reset flow with email verification
- Role-based access control (RBAC) system

Security:
- Bcrypt password hashing (cost factor: 12)
- Rate limiting for login attempts (5 per minute)
- CSRF protection for all authenticated endpoints
- Input validation at all entry points
- Secure session storage with HttpOnly cookies

Performance:
- Redis caching for session data
- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- Response time < 200ms for auth endpoints
- Concurrent request handling with async/await

Testing:
- Unit test coverage: 92%
- Integration tests for all auth flows
- Security tests for XSS, CSRF, injection
- Performance tests verify <200ms response times
- Edge cases: invalid tokens, expired sessions, concurrent logins

Features:
- User registration with email verification
- Login with email/password or OAuth
- Password reset with secure token
- Session management with refresh tokens
- Role-based permissions system
- User profile management

Breaking Changes:
None - This is a new feature

Migration:
No migration needed - New feature, no existing data

```

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive commit created

### 4. Push to Remote

**Objective**: Push feature branch to remote repository.

**Push with upstream tracking**:
```bash
# Push to remote with -u flag to set upstream
git push -u origin feature/issue-123-user-auth

# Verify push succeeded
git status
# Should show: "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/feature/...'"
```

**Handle push errors**:

**Error: Remote branch exists**
```bash
# Fetch and check
git fetch origin
git status

# If behind, pull first
git pull origin feature/issue-123-user-auth

# Then push again
git push -u origin feature/issue-123-user-auth
```

**Error: Branch name doesn't start with 'claude/'**
```bash
# May need to follow project branch naming convention
# Check if project requires specific prefix
# Rename branch if needed:
git branch -m new-branch-name
git push -u origin new-branch-name
```

**Retry logic for network errors**:
```bash
# Retry up to 4 times with exponential backoff
# Try 1: git push (wait 2s if failed)
# Try 2: git push (wait 4s if failed)
# Try 3: git push (wait 8s if failed)
# Try 4: git push (wait 16s if failed)
```

**Deliverable**: Code pushed to remote branch

## Git Workflow Best Practices

### Branch Naming

**Convention**: `<type>/<issue-number>-<brief-description>`

**Examples**:
- `feature/123-user-authentication`
- `fix/124-memory-leak`
- `docs/125-api-documentation`
- `refactor/126-database-layer`

**Create feature branch**:
```bash
# From main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/123-user-auth
```

### Commit Messages

**Follow Conventional Commits**:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Examples**:
```
feat(auth): add JWT authentication

Implement JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens.

Closes #123

fix(cache): resolve memory leak in cache manager

The cache manager was not properly releasing memory
when items expired, causing gradual RAM increase.

Fixes #124

docs(api): update authentication API documentation

Add examples and clarify error responses.
```

### Keeping Branch Updated

**Rebase on main** (if no conflicts):
```bash
# Update main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Rebase feature branch
git checkout feature/123-user-auth
git rebase main

# Force push (if already pushed)
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/123-user-auth
```

**Merge main** (if conflicts or team prefers merge):
```bash
# Update main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Merge into feature
git checkout feature/123-user-auth
git merge main

# Resolve conflicts if any
# Then push
git push origin feature/123-user-auth
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: PR too large

**Problem**: PR has too many changes, hard to review

**Solution**:
1. Break into smaller PRs
2. Create epic issue for tracking
3. Submit incremental PRs

```bash
# Create separate branches for each part
git checkout -b feature/123-auth-part1-models
# Implement models only, create PR

git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/123-auth-part2-service
# Implement service, create PR

# etc.
```

### Issue: Merge conflicts

**Problem**: Branch conflicts with main

**Solution**:
1. Update main
2. Rebase or merge main into feature
3. Resolve conflicts
4. Test everything still works
5. Push updated branch

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/123-auth
git rebase main
# Resolve conflicts
git add .
git rebase --continue
# Test
pytest
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/123-auth
```

### Issue: CI checks failing

**Problem**: PR created but CI checks fail

**Solution**:
1. View check details
2. Fix issues locally
3. Commit and push fixes
4. Verify checks pass

```bash
# View checks
gh pr checks

# Fix issues
# Commit fixes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve CI check failures"
git push origin feature/123-auth

# Verify
gh pr checks
```

### Issue: Missing information in PR

**Problem**: Reviewer asks for more details

**Solution**:
Update PR description

```bash
# Edit PR description
gh pr edit 456 --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
[Updated comprehensive description]
EOF
)"

# Or edit in browser
gh pr edit 456
# Opens editor
```
