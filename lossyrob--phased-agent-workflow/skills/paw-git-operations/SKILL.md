# Git Operations

## Branch Naming Conventions

| Branch Type | Pattern | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Phase branch | `<target>_phase[N]` | `feature/auth-system_phase1` |
| Multi-phase | `<target>_phase[M-N]` | `feature/auth-system_phase1-3` |
| Planning branch | `<target>_plan` | `feature/auth-system_plan` |
| Docs branch | `<target>_docs` | `feature/auth-system_docs` |

**Target branch** is the feature branch from WorkflowContext.md (e.g., `feature/auth-system`).

## Execution Checkout Contract

- Read `WorkflowContext.md` before any git mutation.
- Treat `Repository Identity` as literal `<normalized-origin-slug>@<root-commit-sha>` metadata from `WorkflowContext.md`.
- Treat `Execution Binding` as literal `worktree:<work-id>:<target-branch>` metadata from `WorkflowContext.md`.
- Compare those values literally; do not invent alternate formats.
- If `Execution Mode: worktree`, continue only when the intended execution checkout directory can be proven from `WorkflowContext.md` metadata plus the repo/branch/worktree state for that checkout. The session cwd may differ from the execution checkout.
- When the session cwd differs, all git operations MUST execute in the proven execution checkout directory, either by using path-scoped git commands (for example, `git -C <execution-checkout-path> ...`) or by switching the process cwd there. Do not use the caller checkout as proof or fallback.
- The caller checkout must never be mutated.
- If the execution checkout is ambiguous or cannot be proven from this session, STOP and report recovery guidance instead of guessing.

### Branch-State Matrix

| Execution Mode / Strategy | Caller checkout | Execution checkout |
|---------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| `current-checkout` | Existing behavior; caller checkout is the execution checkout | `Target Branch` and any planning/phase/docs branches behave as they do today |
| `worktree` + local | Branch, `HEAD`, upstream, and status remain unchanged for the full run | Starts on explicit `Target Branch`; all local-strategy commits and pushes happen here |
| `worktree` + prs | Branch, `HEAD`, upstream, and status remain unchanged for the full run | Starts on explicit `Target Branch`; planning/phase/docs branches are created, pushed, and reviewed from here |

## Strategy-Based Branching Logic

### PRs Strategy

Create intermediate branches for each workflow stage; push and create PRs for review.

**Phase work:**
1. Check current branch: `git branch --show-current`
2. If not on correct phase branch:
    - Checkout target branch: `git checkout <target>`
    - Set upstream if not set: `git branch --set-upstream-to=<remote>/<target>`
   - Pull latest: `git pull`
   - Create phase branch from target: `git checkout -b <target>_phase[N]`
3. Verify: `git branch --show-current`
4. Implement on phase branch, commit locally
5. Push: `git push -u <remote> <target>_phase[N]`
6. Create PR: `<target>_phase[N]` → `<target>`

**Planning work:**
1. Checkout target branch: `git checkout <target>`
2. Set upstream if not set: `git branch --set-upstream-to=<remote>/<target>`
3. Pull latest: `git pull`
4. Create planning branch: `git checkout -b <target>_plan`
5. Commit planning artifacts
6. Push: `git push -u <remote> <target>_plan`
7. Create PR: `<target>_plan` → `<target>`

**Docs work:**
1. Checkout target branch: `git checkout <target>`
2. Set upstream if not set: `git branch --set-upstream-to=<remote>/<target>`
3. Pull latest: `git pull`
4. Create docs branch: `git checkout -b <target>_docs`
5. Commit documentation
6. Push: `git push -u <remote> <target>_docs`
7. Create PR: `<target>_docs` → `<target>`

### Local Strategy

Work directly on target branch; no intermediate branches or PRs between stages.

**All work:**
1. Check current branch: `git branch --show-current`
2. If not on target branch:
   - Checkout target: `git checkout <target>`
   - Set upstream if not set: `git branch --set-upstream-to=<remote>/<target>`
   - Pull latest: `git pull`
3. Verify: `git branch --show-current`
4. Implement, commit to target branch
5. Push: `git push <remote> <target>`
6. Skip intermediate PR creation

## Selective Staging Discipline

**CRITICAL**: Never use `git add .` or `git add -A`. Always stage files explicitly.

### Standard Staging

```bash
# Stage specific files
git add <file1> <file2> <file3>

# Verify staged changes before commit
git diff --cached
```

### PAW Artifact Staging

Before staging `.paw/` files, determine the artifact lifecycle mode:

1. Check WorkflowContext.md for `Artifact Lifecycle:` field
2. If absent, check for legacy fields: `artifact_tracking: enabled` or `track_artifacts: true` → `commit-and-clean`; `disabled`/`false` → `never-commit`
3. If absent, check for `.paw/work/<feature-slug>/.gitignore` — if exists with `*`: treat as `never-commit`
4. If none: default to `commit-and-clean`

```bash
# commit-and-clean or commit-and-persist: stage .paw/ files
# (excluding local-only scratch ignore markers)
git add <all-changed-files-except-scratch-ignore-markers>

# never-commit: skip .paw/ files
git add <non-paw-files-only>
```

**Why**: Artifact lifecycle mode controls whether `.paw/` files are committed. `commit-and-clean` and `commit-and-persist` stage artifacts during development; `never-commit` keeps them local-only.

**Scratch ignore markers are always local-only**:
- Treat `.gitignore` files created to keep workflow/scratch areas local-only as lifecycle markers, not repository content
- Examples: `.paw/work/<feature-slug>/.gitignore`, `.paw/work/<feature-slug>/planning/.gitignore`, `.paw/work/<feature-slug>/reviews/.gitignore`, and nested review output `.gitignore` files
- Do NOT stage or commit them in normal commits
- If any scratch ignore marker appears in `git ls-files`, `git diff --cached --name-only`, or the planned PR diff, remove it from the index before committing (for example `git rm --cached <marker-path>`)

## Branch Verification

Before every commit, verify you're on the expected branch:

```bash
# Get current branch
git branch --show-current

# Expected patterns by work type:
# - Phase work (prs): *_phase[N] or *_phase[M-N]
# - Planning (prs): *_plan
# - Docs (prs): *_docs
# - Any work (local): <target> (no suffix)
```

**If on wrong branch**: STOP immediately. Do not commit. Switch to correct branch first.

**Worktree mode note**: The "current branch" above means the branch in the established execution checkout, not the caller checkout that launched PAW.

## Pre-Commit Checklist

1. ✓ Verify current branch matches expected pattern
2. ✓ Stage only related files (no `git add .`)
3. ✓ Check artifact lifecycle mode before staging `.paw/` artifacts
4. ✓ Verify no scratch ignore markers are staged or tracked
5. ✓ Review staged changes: `git diff --cached`
6. ✓ Commit with descriptive message

## Phase PR Creation

After implementation review passes, create Phase PR (PRs strategy only).

### Push and Create PR

```bash
# 1. Verify on phase branch
git branch --show-current  # Should be <target>_phase[N]

# 2. Push branch
git push -u <remote> <target>_phase[N]

# 3. Create PR via gh CLI
gh pr create \
  --base <target> \
  --head <target>_phase[N] \
  --title "[<Work Title>] Phase <N>: <description>" \
  --body "<PR body>"
```

### PR Title Format

`[<Work Title>] Phase <N>: <one-sentence description>`

Example: `[Auth System] Phase 1: Add JWT token validation`

### PR Body Scaling

**Simple phases**:
```
Phase <N>: <one-sentence objective>

### Post-PR Actions

1. Capture PR URL from `gh pr create` output
2. Update ImplementationPlan.md with PR link in phase notes
3. Report PR URL to user

### PR Update Policy

After a PR is opened, post progress updates as **PR comments**, not modifications to the PR body. PR body modifications require explicit user request.

### Reply Format (PR Comments)

When replying to review comments:
