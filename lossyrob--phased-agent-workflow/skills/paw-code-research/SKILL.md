# Code Research

> **Execution Context**: This skill runs in a **subagent** session, delegated by the PAW orchestrator. Return structured results to the orchestrator upon completion.

Document **where and how** code works with precise file:line references. Creates a technical map of the existing system for implementation planning.

> **Reference**: Follow Core Implementation Principles from `paw-workflow` skill.

## Capabilities

- Document implementation details with file:line references
- Discover documentation infrastructure (framework, config, conventions)
- Trace data flows and component interactions
- Find code patterns and integration points
- Generate GitHub permalinks when on pushed commits
- Conduct additional research on demand

## Scope: Implementation Documentation

**Document**:
- Exact file paths and line numbers for components
- Implementation details and technical architecture
- Code patterns and design decisions
- Integration points with specific references
- Test file locations and testing patterns
- Documentation system configuration
## Critical Mindset: Documentarian, Not Critic

Your sole purpose is to document what exists. You are a technical cartographer mapping existing terrain, not a consultant evaluating it.

**NEVER**:
- Suggest improvements or changes
- Perform root cause analysis
- Propose enhancements
- Critique implementation or identify "problems"
- Comment on code quality, performance, or security
- Suggest refactoring or optimization

**ONLY** describe what exists, where it exists, and how components interact.

**May document neutrally** (with file:line evidence): observed constraints, limitations, or risks that inform planning decisions—but without proposing solutions.

**Relationship to SpecResearch.md**: If SpecResearch.md exists, build on that behavioral understanding. If not, focus on implementation details relevant to Spec.md requirements.

## Research Goals

- **Map locations**: Full paths from repo root for all relevant files (implementation, tests, config, docs, types)
- **Trace code paths**: Entry points, data flow, transformations—documented with file:line evidence
- **Identify patterns**: Conventions, similar implementations, reusable structures

**Guidelines**: Include file:line references for all claims. Read thoroughly before stating. Trace actual paths—don't assume.

## Documentation System Discovery

Research documentation infrastructure as a standard component. Capture in CodeResearch.md:

| Aspect | What to Find |
|--------|--------------|
| Framework | mkdocs, docusaurus, sphinx, plain markdown, none |
| Docs Directory | Path to docs folder (e.g., `docs/`, `documentation/`) |
| Navigation Config | mkdocs.yml, sidebar.js, conf.py, etc. |
| Style Conventions | Verbosity level, heading patterns, code block usage |
| Build Command | Command to build/serve docs locally |
| Standard Files | README.md, CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md locations |

**Why**: Planning skill uses this to determine if documentation phases are warranted and how to structure them.

## Verification Commands Discovery

Research project verification commands. Capture in CodeResearch.md:

| Aspect | What to Find |
|--------|--------------|
| Test Command | `npm test`, `make test`, `pytest`, etc. |
| Lint Command | `npm run lint`, `make lint`, `eslint`, etc. |
| Build Command | `npm run build`, `make build`, `tsc`, etc. |
| Type Check | `npm run typecheck`, `tsc --noEmit`, `mypy`, etc. |

**Why**: Implementation skill uses these to verify changes before committing.

# Research: [Topic]

## Research Question

[Original query or derived from Spec.md]

## Summary

[High-level findings answering the research question]

## Documentation System

- **Framework**: [mkdocs/docusaurus/sphinx/markdown/none]
- **Docs Directory**: [path or N/A]
- **Navigation Config**: [path or N/A]
- **Style Conventions**: [key observations]
- **Build Command**: [command or N/A]
- **Standard Files**: [README, CHANGELOG locations]

## Verification Commands

- **Test Command**: [e.g., `npm test`, `make test`, `pytest`]
- **Lint Command**: [e.g., `npm run lint`, `make lint`]
- **Build Command**: [e.g., `npm run build`, `make build`]
- **Type Check**: [e.g., `npm run typecheck`, `tsc --noEmit`]

## Detailed Findings

### [Component/Area 1]

- Description (`file.ext:line`, include permalink if available)
- How it connects to other components
- Current implementation details

### [Component/Area 2]

...

## Code References

- `path/to/file.py:123` - Description
- `another/file.ts:45-67` - Description

## Architecture Documentation

[Patterns, conventions, and design implementations found]

## Open Questions

[Areas needing further investigation, if any]
```

### GitHub Permalinks

When on main branch or pushed commit, permalinks enhance traceability:

```
https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{commit}/{file}#L{line}
```

Permalinks are optional—file:line references are the primary evidence requirement. If remote URL and commit SHA are readily available, include permalinks; otherwise proceed without them.

## Execution

### Desired End States

- All relevant components documented with file:line references
- Documentation infrastructure captured
- Findings organized logically by component or concern
- CodeResearch.md saved with valid YAML frontmatter

### Workflow Mode Adaptation

| Mode | Spec Artifact | Approach |
|------|---------------|----------|
| full | Spec.md exists | Read Spec.md for context, comprehensive research |
| minimal | Spec.md may not exist | Use Issue URL as requirements source |
| custom | Check Custom Workflow Instructions | Adapt based on instructions |

If Spec.md expected but missing, note it and use Issue URL as fallback.

### Follow-up Research

For additional questions after initial research:
- Append to existing CodeResearch.md
- Add `## Follow-up Research [timestamp]` section
- Update frontmatter: `last_updated`, add `last_updated_note`

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] All research objectives addressed with supporting evidence
- [ ] Every claim includes file:line references (or permalinks when available)
- [ ] Findings organized logically by component or concern
- [ ] Documentation System section completed
- [ ] GitHub permalinks added when on pushed commit
- [ ] Tone remains descriptive and neutral (no critiques or recommendations)
- [ ] CodeResearch.md saved with valid YAML frontmatter

## Completion Response

Report to PAW agent:
- Artifact path: `.paw/work/<work-id>/CodeResearch.md`
- Summary of key findings
- Any open questions requiring user input
