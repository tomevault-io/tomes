# NixOS Config Repo Skill

A Nixarchy machine ships with `/etc/nixos` **already a git repository** — the
installer runs `git init` and `git add -A`, because a flake in a worktree cannot
see untracked files and the very first `nixos-install` would fail otherwise.

It stops there, on purpose: `git commit` needs a name and an email, and picking
the user's is not an installer's job. So the state you will usually find is:

- a repository, with
- one staged tree, and
- **no commit, no identity, no `.gitignore`, no remote.**

The gap is not "get this into git". It is that the machine's entire definition
has no history and exists on exactly one disk.

## The Short Version

There is a command that does all of this, interactively and idempotently:

```bash
nixarchy config repo          # or: nixarchy-config-repo
```

It detects what is already true and skips those steps, scans for secrets before
the first commit, asks about public vs private, creates the remote via `gh`/`glab`
(fetched on demand — neither is in the closure), and offers an eval-only CI
workflow. **Prefer it over doing the steps by hand**, and use this skill to
explain what it did, to handle a case it does not cover, or to fix something
afterwards.

`nixarchy-config-repo --check` exits 0 only when the nudge is worth showing. It
is what the post-boot hook calls.

## The Two Things That Actually Bite

### 1. Untracked files are invisible to the build

```
error: path '/nix/store/...-source/foo.nix' does not exist
```

or, worse, no error at all — the file is simply absent from the build and the
change appears to do nothing.

**A flake in a git repository sees only tracked or staged files.** A new `.nix`
file that has not been `git add`ed does not exist as far as Nix is concerned.

```bash
sudo git -C /etc/nixos add -A          # before every rebuild, after adding a file
```

This is the single most common reason a NixOS change "does nothing", and it is
worth checking first whenever someone says an edit had no effect.

### 2. `/etc/nixos` is owned by somebody other than you

```
fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/etc/nixos'
```

The installer chowns `/etc/nixos` to the user it creates, so on a machine it
wrote, plain `git` as that user just works. You will see this on a machine
installed before that changed, or one whose owner chowned it back to root --
where every git command splits in two: reads need `safe.directory`, writes
need `sudo`.

Note that nix hits the same check without saying so usefully. It opens the
flake through libgit2 and reports the refusal as `could not find a flake.nix
file`, which sends people looking for a missing file that is right there.
Current nixarchy ships a `safe.directory` entry in `/etc/gitconfig` for
exactly this; a machine that predates it has not got one.

```bash
git -c safe.directory=/etc/nixos -C /etc/nixos log        # read
sudo git -C /etc/nixos commit -m "..."                    # write
```

Root has no `user.name`/`user.email`, so a `sudo git commit` fails until an
identity is supplied. Pass the user's rather than creating a root one:

```bash
sudo git -C /etc/nixos \
  -c user.name="$(git config --global user.name)" \
  -c user.email="$(git config --global user.email)" \
  commit -m "..."
```

Or set `safe.directory` once and stop thinking about half of it:

```bash
git config --global --add safe.directory /etc/nixos
```

### Moving it out of `/etc/nixos`

Most of the friction above disappears if the config lives in the user's home,
which is what most people end up doing:

```bash
sudo mv /etc/nixos ~/nixos-config
sudo chown -R "$USER:users" ~/nixos-config
```

```nix
programs.nixarchy.flake = "/home/<user>/nixos-config";
```

Then `git` works normally and only `nixos-rebuild` needs `sudo`. Mention this
option when someone is fighting ownership repeatedly — but **do not move it
unprompted**; `NIXARCHY_FLAKE`, `nixarchy-apply` and any existing habit all point
at the old path, and a half-moved config is worse than either.

## .gitignore

The judgement call is what *not* to ignore.

```gitignore
# Build outputs — store symlinks, meaningless elsewhere
result
result-*

.direnv/
*.swp

# Plaintext secrets
*.key
*.pem
id_rsa
id_ed25519
.env
.env.*
secrets/*.txt
```

**Do not ignore `*.age` or sops-encrypted YAML.** Encrypted secrets are *meant*
to be committed — that is the entire point of agenix and sops-nix, and ignoring
them breaks the build on every other machine. See the `nixos-secrets` skill.

**Do not ignore `flake.lock`.** It is what makes the configuration reproducible;
an ignored lock file means a different system on every machine and every clone.

## Before Making It Public

A NixOS configuration is not a secret document, and plenty of people publish
theirs deliberately. What it does contain: hostname, username, SSH **public**
keys, network layout, which services run, and sometimes hashed passwords.

Private is the right default. Public should be a decision.

Scan before publishing, and before the first commit of an inherited config:

```bash
grep -rInE '(password|secret|token|api_?key)[[:space:]]*=[[:space:]]*"' --include='*.nix' .
grep -rn "hashedPassword\b" --include='*.nix' .     # prefer hashedPasswordFile
```

**A secret that was ever committed is leaked** — rotate it, do not just delete
the line. Rewriting history does not help once it has been pushed or built, and
`/nix/store` is world-readable regardless. Say this plainly rather than offering
a history rewrite as a fix.

## CI

Check the configuration on push. **Evaluation, not a full build** — a real system
build takes hours on a free runner and regularly exceeds its disk, while eval
catches renamed options, type errors and typos, which is the overwhelming
majority of what actually breaks.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/check.yml
name: check
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action@main
      - uses: DeterminateSystems/magic-nix-cache-action@main
      - run: nix flake check --all-systems --no-build
```

GitLab equivalent:

```yaml
check:
  image: nixos/nix:latest
  variables:
    NIX_CONFIG: "experimental-features = nix-command flakes"
  script:
    - nix flake check --all-systems --no-build
```

`--no-build` is doing real work in both: without it, `flake check` tries to
realise every derivation the flake defines.

To evaluate each host by name, so a failure says *which* one:

```bash
nix eval --raw .#nixosConfigurations.<host>.config.system.build.toplevel.drvPath
```

That forces the whole module system to evaluate — every option, every assertion —
without building anything. It is the most value per second of CI time available
for a NixOS flake.

Offer a full build only when the user has a cache to push to (Cachix, Attic) or a
self-hosted runner. Without one it is slow, flaky, and usually abandoned.

## The Ongoing Workflow

```bash
cd /etc/nixos
sudo git add -A                       # BEFORE the rebuild — new files must be tracked
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
sudo git commit -m "what changed"     # after it works
sudo git push
```

Commit messages worth writing say what changed about the *machine*, not the file:
"Enable Tailscale", not "update configuration.nix".

The generation number and the commit are two different histories of the same
thing. Tying them together makes both more useful:

```bash
sudo git commit -m "Enable Tailscale (generation $(readlink /nix/var/nix/profiles/system | sed 's/.*-//'))"
```

Do not `git commit` a broken config to "save progress" and push it — CI will
catch it, but so will the next person who clones it. `nixos-rebuild build` first.

## Other Hosts in One Repo

The natural next step once a config is in git, and worth mentioning when someone
gets a second machine:

```nix
nixosConfigurations = {
  laptop  = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem { modules = [ ./hosts/laptop  ]; };
  desktop = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem { modules = [ ./hosts/desktop ]; };
};
```

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#laptop
```

Shared modules go in `./modules`, per-machine differences in `./hosts/<name>`.
Do not restructure someone's working single-host config into this shape unless
they ask.

**That is as far as this skill goes.** The `nixos-fleet` skill owns the multi-host
layout itself — what a nixarchy-installed repository already looks like, what
belongs in a shared module versus a host file, `nixarchy-apply`'s hostname match,
pulling on a timer and deploying with `--target-host`. This skill owns git around
it: remotes, CI, ignores, and getting the configuration in there at all. Hand a
"several machines" question over rather than answering half of it here.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| `path '/nix/store/...' does not exist` | Untracked file. `sudo git add -A` |
| A new option had no effect at all | Same — the file was never staged |
| `detected dubious ownership` | Root-owned repo. `safe.directory`, or `sudo` |
| `Author identity unknown` under sudo | Root has no identity. Pass `-c user.name=... -c user.email=...` |
| `Permission denied (publickey)` on push | SSH key not on the provider, or you are pushing as root, whose keys are not yours |
| Push rejected, non-fast-forward | Remote has commits yours does not. `git pull --rebase` |
| CI fails, local rebuild works | Almost always an untracked file: it exists locally and not in the clone |
| `gh: command not found` | Not in the closure by design. `nix shell nixpkgs#gh -c gh ...` |

That second-to-last row is worth internalising: **CI is the thing that catches an
untracked file**, because a clone is the only place the missing file is actually
missing. A green local rebuild proves nothing about the repo.

## Rules

- **`sudo git add -A` before the rebuild, not after.** Untracked is invisible.
- **Prefer `nixarchy config repo`** to hand-rolling the setup; it is idempotent
  and it scans for secrets first.
- **Never commit a plaintext secret**, and treat one that was committed as leaked
  and needing rotation — not as something a history rewrite fixes.
- **Never ignore `flake.lock`** or encrypted `.age`/sops files.
- **Default to a private repository.** Public is fine and common, but deliberate.
- **Eval-only CI unless the user has a binary cache.** A full build on a free
  runner is a promise that will not be kept.
- Do not move the config out of `/etc/nixos` unprompted, and do not restructure a
  working single-host flake into a multi-host layout uninvited.
