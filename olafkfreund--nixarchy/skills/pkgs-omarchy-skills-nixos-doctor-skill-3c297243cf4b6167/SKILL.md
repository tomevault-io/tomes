# NixOS Doctor Skill

The skill to reach for **before** you know what is wrong. It answers "what is the
state of this machine" in a fixed order, so nothing obvious gets skipped while
chasing a theory.

Two NixOS-specific advantages worth using immediately:

- **The previous working system is still on disk.** "It broke after an update" is
  answerable by diffing generations, and fixable by rolling back.
- **The whole configuration is one readable tree.** You never have to guess what
  is installed or enabled — you can read it.

## The Sweep

Run this in order. Do not skip ahead to a hunch.

```bash
# 1. What is broken right now
systemctl list-units --failed
systemctl --user list-units --failed

# 2. This boot's errors, no noise
journalctl -b -p err --no-pager | tail -40

# 3. Kernel — hardware, drivers, filesystems, OOM
journalctl -b -k -p warning --no-pager | tail -40

# 4. Resources
df -h | grep -vE 'tmpfs|/nix/store'
free -h
uptime

# 5. What changed, and when
sudo nix-env --list-generations --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/system | tail -5
```

Those five commands identify the cause of most problems. Report what they say
before proposing a fix.

### Then, by symptom

```bash
# Boot problems
journalctl -b -1 -p err --no-pager | tail -40    # the PREVIOUS boot, if it hung
systemd-analyze blame | head -20

# Network
ip a; ip route; resolvectl status
ping -c3 1.1.1.1 && ping -c3 nixos.org           # routing vs DNS, in one line

# Hardware
sensors                                          # temperatures
journalctl -b -k | grep -iE 'error|fail|i/o|reset|thermal'
sudo smartctl -H /dev/nvme0n1                    # disk health
lsblk -f

# Memory pressure / freezes
journalctl -b | grep -iE 'oom|killed process|out of memory'
cat /proc/pressure/memory /proc/pressure/io

# Graphical session
journalctl --user -b -u hyprland --no-pager | tail -40
journalctl -b | grep -iE 'drm|amdgpu|nvidia|gpu hang'
```

## Wireless: Firmware, Drivers, and the Out-of-Tree Trap

`nixarchy doctor` has a **Wireless** section that separates the three cases a
user cannot tell apart from nmtui, because they have three different fixes:

| doctor says | meaning | fix |
|---|---|---|
| "interface `wlpXsY` is up" | working | nothing — if they cannot see networks, that is NetworkManager, not the driver |
| "No PCI wireless card here" | nothing on the PCI bus | a USB adapter, which the doctor does not see — check `lsusb` |
| "a card with no driver" | no module claimed it | firmware or an out-of-tree driver, below |
| "driver loaded, but no interface" | module bound then failed | almost always a missing firmware blob — `journalctl -b -k \| grep -i firmware` names the file |

Run the doctor first. It prints the vendor, the device id, and a pasteable
snippet, and those three facts decide everything below.

### There is no `wlan0`

Before anything else, rule this out — it is free and it is usually the answer.
systemd renames interfaces after the PCI slot, so an Intel card at `00:14.3`
becomes `wlp0s20f3`. Someone searching for "wlan0" finds nothing on a machine
whose Wi-Fi is perfect. `ip link` settles it.

### Firmware first

Most "no driver" cases are a missing blob, not a missing driver:

```nix
hardware.enableRedistributableFirmware = true;   # default since v4.0.2-11
hardware.enableAllFirmware = true;               # adds b43, brcm; needs allowUnfree
```

`enableAllFirmware` requires `nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree = true`, which the
installer-generated configuration already sets.

### Broadcom, and why it is a special case

Upstream Omarchy ships `broadcom-wl-dkms`. This port does not, and the doctor
names the equivalent instead. **Try `enableAllFirmware` first** — every recent
Broadcom card is FullMAC and served by the in-tree `brcmfmac`, so the blob is
the whole fix.

Only if that leaves the card dead is it one of the old chips — BCM4360,
BCM4352, BCM43142, BCM4331 — that need Broadcom's out-of-tree `wl` driver.
nixpkgs has it:

```nix
boot.extraModulePackages = [ config.boot.kernelPackages.broadcom_sta ];
boot.blacklistedKernelModules = [ "b43" "bcma" "brcmsmac" "ssb" ];
nixpkgs.config.permittedInsecurePackages = [
  "broadcom-sta-6.30.223.271-63-<KERNEL>"   # <KERNEL> is `uname -r`
];
```

**Say the cost out loud before recommending it.** It is unmaintained and
carries CVE-2019-9501 and CVE-2019-9502 — heap overflows a crafted Wi-Fi packet
can turn into remote code execution, on the one interface facing networks the
user does not control. It is a last resort for hardware that otherwise has no
Wi-Fi at all, not a default.

Three things about it that are not guessable, and each produces a different
confusing failure if you omit it:

1. **The blacklist is mandatory, not tidiness.** `wl` binds by PCI *class*, not
   by device id — its only modalias is `pci:v*d*sv*sd*bc02sc80i*` — so it takes
   the card from `b43` and `brcmsmac` whether or not that was intended. Without
   the blacklist the machine builds fine and still has no Wi-Fi, which is the
   failure that looks like the fix.
2. **The allowlist string contains the kernel version**, so it is correct today
   and stale after the next kernel bump.
3. **The package version can move too.** `6.30.223.271-63` is what nixpkgs
   carries now; when it changes, the string changes with it.

### Maintaining it across kernel updates — the part that actually bites

This is the follow-up question, and it arrives weeks later looking like an
unrelated bug. After `omarchy update` moves nixpkgs, the kernel moves, and the
rebuild fails like this:

```
Package 'broadcom-sta-6.30.223.271-63-6.18.50' ... has known security issues
```

It says nothing about Wi-Fi. The user's mental model is "my update broke", and
the string in their config names a kernel they no longer run.

**The fix is always the same, and the error hands it over:** the message names
the exact string it wants. Paste *that* into `permittedInsecurePackages`,
replacing the old one, and rebuild. Never hand-edit the version guessing —
both halves can move.

Two ways to stop it recurring, and the honest recommendation is the first:

- **Replace the card.** A £10 Intel AX200 removes an unmaintained RCE-prone
  driver from a machine permanently and needs no configuration at all. nixpkgs'
  own metadata says "heavily recommended to replace the hardware".
- **Pin the kernel** so the string stops moving —
  `boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_6_12;` — at the cost of not getting
  kernel security updates, which for a driver with remote code execution is a
  poor trade. Say so if suggesting it.

If the user asks "why does Arch handle this and NixOS does not": Arch's DKMS
rebuilds the module on kernel change without a version string in the config,
and Arch does not gate insecure packages. NixOS makes the same driver
available and makes its cost explicit. The driver is identical — same Broadcom
tarball, same rpmfusion patch set.

## Reading the Journal Properly

The journal is the whole logging story on NixOS — there are no per-service files
in `/var/log` to grep.

```bash
journalctl -u foo                 # one unit
journalctl -u foo -b              # this boot only
journalctl -u foo -f              # follow, while you reproduce the problem
journalctl -b -1                  # the previous boot (essential after a hang)
journalctl --since "10 min ago"
journalctl --since "2024-01-15 09:00" --until "2024-01-15 10:00"
journalctl -p err                 # emerg,alert,crit,err — 0..3
journalctl -k                     # kernel only (dmesg, but persistent)
journalctl -g 'regex' --no-pager  # grep, server-side
journalctl -o json-pretty -n 1    # every field, when a message is ambiguous
journalctl _PID=1234
journalctl --disk-usage
```

Two habits that save real time:

- **`-b -1` after any hang, freeze or unclean reboot.** The evidence is in the
  boot that died, not the one you are typing in.
- **`--no-pager` plus `tail`** — otherwise output blocks waiting for a pager that
  an agent cannot drive.

Persistence across reboots is not universal. Check, and enable it if a
post-mortem is going to be needed:

```nix
services.journald.extraConfig = ''
  Storage=persistent
  SystemMaxUse=1G
'';
```

### Severity, honestly

Most `warning` lines on a healthy Linux box are noise — firmware chatter,
ACPI complaints, unsupported hardware probes. **Start at `-p err`.** Reporting a
list of harmless warnings as findings is worse than saying nothing, because it
buries the one line that matters.

## "It Broke After an Update"

This is the strongest position NixOS puts you in. Answer it with evidence:

```bash
# What changed between the last two system generations
nix profile diff-closures --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/system | tail -30

# When each generation was built
sudo nix-env --list-generations --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/system

# And if it is bad — go back, now
sudo nixos-rebuild --rollback switch
```

Or pick an older generation from the boot menu. A rollback is complete and
instant; there is no partial state to clean up. Offer it early rather than
debugging a broken desktop from inside the broken desktop.

`nix profile diff-closures` is a real answer to "what did that update change" —
package-by-package, with version deltas. It beats reading a changelog.

**Caveat:** a rollback restores the *system*, not mutable state. Databases,
`/var/lib` contents, model weights and home directories do not roll back. Say so
when the failing thing is stateful.

## Disk Full

Usually the Nix store, and usually not urgent to solve destructively:

```bash
df -h
du -xh --max-depth=1 / 2>/dev/null | sort -rh | head -15
nix path-info -Sh /run/current-system            # size of the current system closure
du -sh /var/log/journal
```

```bash
sudo nix-collect-garbage --delete-older-than 30d   # keeps a rollback window
sudo nix-collect-garbage -d                        # deletes EVERY old generation
sudo nix store optimise                            # dedupe by hard-linking; safe
```

**`-d` destroys the rollback safety net.** Ask first, always, and prefer the
`--delete-older-than` form. `nix store optimise` frees space with no downside and
should be offered before either.

Note that garbage collection only frees what nothing references — if the machine
is full because one closure is genuinely huge (a global `cudaSupport`, a
container image, model weights), GC will not help and the honest answer is to say
so.

## Reading the Configuration

```bash
echo "${NIXARCHY_FLAKE:-/etc/nixos}"       # where the config lives
nixos-option services.nginx                # value AND which file set it
nixos-version --json
systemctl cat foo                          # the unit Nix actually generated
ls -l /run/current-system                  # the store path in use right now
```

`nixos-option` answering "where did this value come from" is what turns "why is
this enabled" from a grep hunt into one command.

## Health Report Template

When asked for a picture of the system, report in this shape — facts first, one
conclusion, and be explicit about what is fine:

```
State:     up N days, load a/b/c, N failed units
Disk:      / at N% (X GB free), /nix at N%
Memory:    X of Y GB used, swap N%, PSI avg10 N
Errors:    <the actual err-level lines, or "none this boot">
Hardware:  temps, disk SMART, anything in the kernel log
Changed:   generation N built <date>; last change was <what>
```

If everything is fine, say that plainly. A clean bill of health is a useful
result, and padding it with warnings to look thorough is not.

## Escalating

| Finding | Go to |
|---|---|
| A specific unit failing | `nixos-services` skill |
| A program crashed / core dump | `diagnose-crash` skill |
| Slow, hot, stuttering, bad battery | `nixos-performance` skill |
| GPU not working, black screen | `nixos-gpu` skill |
| Something exposed, or a firewall question | `nixos-security` skill |
| Needs a package or option changed | `nixos` skill |
| Desktop, Hyprland, theming | `nixarchy` skill |

## Rules

- **Run the sweep before forming a theory.** The failed-units list and `-p err`
  take three seconds and are right more often than a hunch.
- **Always `--no-pager`** on journalctl, and bound the output with `tail` or `-n`.
- **Start at `-p err`.** Do not report routine warnings as findings.
- **Quote the actual log line.** A paraphrased error is not evidence, and the
  exact text is what makes the cause searchable.
- **Use `-b -1` after any hang or unclean reboot.**
- **Offer rollback early** when the timeline points at an update — it is faster
  than debugging, and losing nothing is the whole point of the design.
- **Never garbage-collect without asking**, and never with `-d` as the first
  suggestion.
- Say plainly when a check comes back clean. Do not manufacture findings.
