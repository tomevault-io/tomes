# Android on nixarchy

Two answers, and they fail in opposite directions. Pick before configuring.

| | scrcpy | Waydroid |
|---|---|---|
| what it is | mirrors and controls **a real phone you own** | runs Android **in a container** on this machine |
| needs a phone | yes | no |
| ARM-only apps | **work** — they run on the phone | **do not run** (see below) |
| banking, DRM, attestation | **work** — real device, real attestation | usually refuse: it is a container |
| Play Store | whatever the phone has | not included by default |
| cost | a USB cable, or a pairing dance | a container runtime and a large image |

**If the person owns the phone and wants their apps, scrcpy is almost always
the better answer**, and it needs nothing configured beyond the package.
Waydroid is for running Android *without* a phone.

## Do not set `programs.adb.enable`

Most NixOS advice about Android says to. **It does nothing now**, and nixpkgs
says so when a system using it is built:

> The option definition `programs.adb' no longer has any effect; please remove
> it. This option is no longer needed as systemd 258 handles uaccess rules
> automatically.

Measured against the current pin: with it set, `services.udev.packages` is
unchanged, `services.udev.extraRules` is byte-identical, no `adbusers` group
appears, and the `etc` derivation is the same store path.

**So USB permissions need no configuration at all.** If a device shows as
`unauthorized`, that is the *phone* not having accepted the RSA prompt — not a
udev rule and not a group. Look at the phone's screen.

## scrcpy

Install through the menu (*Install ▸ Utility ▸ scrcpy*), or declaratively:

```nix
programs.nixarchy.apps.scrcpy = true;
```

### Over USB — try this first

1. On the phone, enable **Developer options** (tap *Build number* seven times),
   then **USB debugging**.
2. Plug it in and accept the RSA prompt **on the phone**.
3. Run `scrcpy`.

That is the whole procedure. No udev rules, no groups, no extra packages.

### `adb` is not on your PATH, and that surprises people

`scrcpy` is a wrapper that puts `adb` on the path **of its own process only**.
So `scrcpy` works, and typing `adb` in a shell says "command not found".

Fine for USB. Wireless pairing needs `adb` in *your* shell, so add it:

```nix
environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.android-tools ];
```

`android-tools` is deliberately not in the app catalogue: the catalogue derives
a command name from the package, and this one ships `adb`, `fastboot` and a
dozen others under an attribute called `android-tools` — so the machinery would
report it missing on a machine that has it.

### Over Wi-Fi — the part that actually goes wrong

Android 11+ uses **two different ports** and a code on a timer. Getting this
wrong is the usual reason people give up.

1. On the phone: *Developer options ▸ **Wireless debugging*** ▸ on.
2. Tap **Pair device with pairing code**. The phone shows a six-digit code and
   an address ending in a **pairing port**.
3. Pair, using **that** port:

   ```
   adb pair 192.168.1.50:37419
   ```

   It asks for the code. **The code expires in seconds** — have it on screen
   before running this.
4. Now connect, using the **other** port, the one on the main Wireless
   debugging screen:

   ```
   adb connect 192.168.1.50:5555
   ```

5. `scrcpy`

**The two ports are different, and the pairing one changes every time.** Using
the connect port for `adb pair` fails with a message that does not say so.

Pairing is remembered; connecting is not. After either machine reboots, step 4
alone is usually enough.

Discovery, instead of reading numbers off a screen:

```
adb mdns services
```

That needs mDNS resolution on the network. If it lists nothing while the phone
is definitely advertising, the problem is name resolution, not pairing — fall
back to typing the address.

### When it fails

```
adb devices -l
adb kill-server
journalctl -b -k | grep -i usb
```

| symptom | cause |
|---|---|
| `unauthorized` | the phone has not accepted the RSA prompt — look at the phone |
| `offline` | usually a stale wireless connection; `adb disconnect`, then reconnect |
| pair fails instantly | the code expired, or the connect port was used |
| nothing from `adb mdns services` | mDNS, not adb — try the address by hand |
| black screen, phone fine | the app blocks screen capture (banking, DRM) |

## Waydroid

```nix
virtualisation.waydroid.enable = true;
```

That is genuinely all the configuration. It puts `waydroid` on PATH and adds
the `waydroid-container` service. It adds **no kernel modules**: `binder` comes
from the mainline kernel, which a stock nixarchy kernel is. A custom kernel may
not have it.

After the rebuild, the image is downloaded once:

```
waydroid init
waydroid session start
waydroid show-full-ui
```

`waydroid first-launch` does init-then-start in one step if it has not been
initialised yet. Other subcommands worth knowing: `status`, `session`,
`container`, `app`, `shell`, `logcat`, `log`.

### Say this before they install it

**ARM-only apps will not run.** Waydroid executes Android on *this* machine's
kernel with no CPU emulation — that is why it is fast — so an app built only
for ARM has nothing to run on. It would need a translation layer (libhoudini,
libndk) that Waydroid does not ship and nixpkgs does not package. A large share
of popular apps are ARM-only, so "it installed and the app crashes immediately"
is the expected outcome for those, not a misconfiguration.

**No Play Store** by default: the image is GAPPS-free. A feature for some
people and a surprise for others.

**Attestation fails.** Banking and DRM apps generally detect the container and
refuse. That is the class scrcpy exists for.

### When it fails

```
waydroid status
waydroid log
```

If `waydroid init` cannot download, that is a network problem rather than a
Waydroid one. If the container starts and no UI appears, check that `waydroid
status` reports a **session** as well as a container — they are separate
things, and `session start` is a separate step.

## Rules

- **Never tell someone to set `programs.adb.enable`.** It is inert, and the
  advice sends them hunting udev rules when the real answer is a prompt on the
  phone's screen.
- **Ask which of the two they want before configuring either.** Installing
  Waydroid for somebody who has the phone in their pocket is a large download
  to arrive at the worse answer.
- **State the ARM limitation before the install, not after the crash.**
- Both are declarative here. Neither needs an imperative installer, and nothing
  installed imperatively survives a rebuild.
