# Release Apache Asyncband

Help the release manager carry out the requested release work, explain the current state, and propose practical next steps. Keep release coordination in the main conversation. Delegate substantial candidate verification when it can run independently, and use the shared license-audit skill for the licensing review. The release manager and project community make release decisions.

## Resume the requested work

Establish the requested scope and what has already happened from the conversation, current checkout, and relevant external records. Read the affected parts of `asyncband/Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `.asf.yaml`, and `xtask/src/main.rs` when needed. Use live GitHub, ASF distribution, mailing-list archives, and registry records to resolve uncertain state. Load only the reference for the current phase; an existing candidate does not require repeating preparation or setup.

Carry forward the user's existing authorization. A status check, review, or plan stays read-only. For execution, complete authorized work and prepare any proposed external action before asking about authorization that is actually missing. Sending vote or announcement messages, publishing, merging, or changing tags needs authorization for that action; opening this skill does not provide it. Preserve the user's work when selecting a checkout or creating a release worktree.

Keep these values and supporting links in the conversation so work can resume across turns:

- `VERSION`: the final crate version, such as `0.7.2`; RCs do not change the package version.
- `RC`: the positive candidate number; `RC_TAG` is `v${VERSION}-rc.${RC}`.
- `RELEASE_COMMIT`: the merged release pull request commit bound to the candidate.
- `RELEASE_DIR`: an absolute working directory outside the repository for artifacts, verification, and SVN checkouts; reuse it while continuing the same candidate.
- Candidate tag and artifact location, checksum/signature results, relevant CI runs, PPMC/IPMC vote threads and results, and completed publication steps.

Report completed work with evidence, the next useful step, and any input still needed. Distinguish pending, failed, and unverified steps. Keep handoff notes in the conversation unless the user requests a file.

## Choose the current phase

| Current work                                      | Read                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Version/changelog PR, RC, artifacts, or staging   | [Candidate preparation](references/candidate.md)     |
| Checking an existing candidate's artifacts        | [Candidate verification](references/verification.md) |
| Voting, approved publication, follow-up, or retry | [Publication](references/publication.md)             |

The phase guides are the maintained release procedure for both people and agents. Existing infrastructure is described in [Infrastructure](references/infrastructure.md); read it only for configuration changes, a new release manager's signing key, or infrastructure troubleshooting.

Links within this skill resolve from the containing document and stay within this skill's files. Repository paths such as `.github/workflows/release.yml` resolve from the caller's Asyncband repository root, which may differ from the current working directory. Locate the `license-audit` skill and configured agents by name; if skill discovery is unavailable, read `.agents/skills/license-audit/SKILL.md` from that repository root. Do not infer repository locations by walking upward from this skill's installation directory.

Read `cargo x --help` and the relevant subcommand help before running repository checks.

## Delegate candidate verification

Use the `release_verifier` Codex agent for a substantial check of an existing candidate when the main agent can continue independent work, such as preparing vote materials. Other coding agents can delegate the same candidate-verification guide to a worker or follow it directly. Keep a small status query in the main conversation.

Give the verifier the repository root, candidate commit and tag, version, absolute artifact paths, expected signing fingerprint and its provenance, requested checks, and a scratch directory outside the checkout. It returns the checked revision and artifacts, observed results, and remaining gaps. Preserve the original artifacts for a separate `license-audit` review; the verifier does not duplicate that audit. Collect the results before staging or publishing the candidate.

## Candidate and publication continuity

The signed source archive approved by the Apache Incubator PMC and published through ASF distribution is the official Apache release. Its name is `apache-asyncband-${VERSION}-incubating-src.tar.gz`. The crates.io package is a convenience distribution from the same approved commit; keep its Cargo-generated name and layout.

Keep the RC tag, commit, artifacts, and vote tied together. A later `main` commit does not invalidate an existing candidate. Reuse an existing signed tag and staged bytes when retrying a transient failure. If candidate content changes or the community rejects it, agree on the replacement candidate and increment `RC`; preserve existing tags rather than rewriting them.

After both vote results record approval, promote the exact voted source artifacts. The signed final `v${VERSION}` tag uses the approved RC commit and starts the crates.io publication workflow, subject to the configured `release` environment review. Successful CI alone does not establish vote approval. Confirm each external action's result before reporting completion or retrying it.

Use the shared `license-audit` skill to examine the relevant checkout or artifact contents. In Codex, the configured `license_auditor` can perform a delegated review; another agent can follow the same skill directly. Provide the candidate revision and actual artifact paths, then discuss the review's evidence and suggestions with the release manager.

Follow the current [ASF Release Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html), [Release Distribution Policy](https://infra.apache.org/release-distribution), [Release Creation Process](https://infra.apache.org/release-publishing.html), and [Incubator release guidance](https://incubator.apache.org/guides/releasemanagement.html). Explain any relevant ambiguity with its source and practical options instead of treating incomplete evidence as a project defect.
