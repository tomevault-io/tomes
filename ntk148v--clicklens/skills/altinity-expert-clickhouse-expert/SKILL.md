# ClickHouse Analyst

Modular agent for ClickHouse diagnostics and performance analysis.

## Startup Procedure

1. Verify connectivity: `select hostname(), version()`
2. If connection fails, stop and report error
3. Report hostname and version to user
4. Based on user request, load appropriate module(s)

### Multi-Module Scenarios

Some problems require multiple modules. Load in order listed.

| Symptom Pattern | Modules to Load |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| "general health check" | `altinity-expert-clickhouse-overview` → route to specific modules |
| "inserts are slow" | `altinity-expert-clickhouse-ingestion` → `altinity-expert-clickhouse-merges` → `altinity-expert-clickhouse-storage` |
| "too many parts error" | `altinity-expert-clickhouse-merges` → `altinity-expert-clickhouse-ingestion` → `altinity-expert-clickhouse-schema` |
| "queries timing out" | `altinity-expert-clickhouse-reporting` → `altinity-expert-clickhouse-memory` → `altinity-expert-clickhouse-caches` |
| "server is slow overall" | `altinity-expert-clickhouse-overview` → `altinity-expert-clickhouse-memory` → `altinity-expert-clickhouse-storage` |
| "replication lag" | `altinity-expert-clickhouse-replication` → `altinity-expert-clickhouse-merges` → `altinity-expert-clickhouse-storage` |
| "OOM during merge" | `altinity-expert-clickhouse-memory` → `altinity-expert-clickhouse-merges` → `altinity-expert-clickhouse-schema` |
| "mutations not completing" | `altinity-expert-clickhouse-mutations` → `altinity-expert-clickhouse-merges` → `altinity-expert-clickhouse-errors` |
| "cache hit ratio low" | `altinity-expert-clickhouse-caches` → `altinity-expert-clickhouse-schema` → `altinity-expert-clickhouse-memory` |
| "readonly replica" | `altinity-expert-clickhouse-replication` → `altinity-expert-clickhouse-storage` → `altinity-expert-clickhouse-text-log` |
| "schema review needed" | `altinity-expert-clickhouse-schema` → `altinity-expert-clickhouse-overview` → `altinity-expert-clickhouse-ingestion` |
| "version upgrade planning" | `altinity-expert-clickhouse-overview` (version check) |
| "system log issues" | `altinity-expert-clickhouse-logs` → `altinity-expert-clickhouse-storage` |

### Module Chaining

Modules may suggest loading additional modules based on findings. Follow these triggers:

```
altinity-expert-clickhouse-merges findings:
  - Slow merges + high disk IO → load altinity-expert-clickhouse-storage
  - Slow merges + normal disk → load altinity-expert-clickhouse-schema
  - Merge blocked by mutation → load altinity-expert-clickhouse-mutations

altinity-expert-clickhouse-ingestion findings:
  - Part backlog growing → load altinity-expert-clickhouse-merges
  - High memory during insert → load altinity-expert-clickhouse-memory
  - MV slow during insert → load altinity-expert-clickhouse-reporting (for MV analysis)

altinity-expert-clickhouse-reporting findings:
  - Query reads too many parts → load altinity-expert-clickhouse-merges, altinity-expert-clickhouse-schema
  - High memory queries → load altinity-expert-clickhouse-memory
  - Distributed query slow → load altinity-expert-clickhouse-replication
```

## Global Query Rules

Apply to ALL modules.

### SQL Style
- Lowercase keywords: `select`, `from`, `where`, `order by`
- Explicit columns only, never `select *`
- Default `limit 100` unless user specifies otherwise
- No comments in executed SQL

### Time Bounds (Required for *_log tables)
```sql
-- Default: last 24 hours
where event_date = today()

-- Or explicit time window
where event_time > now() - interval 1 hour

-- For longer analysis
where event_date >= today() - 7
```

### Result Size Management
- If query returns > 50 rows, summarize before presenting
- For large result sets, aggregate in SQL rather than loading raw data
- Use `formatReadableSize()`, `formatReadableQuantity()` for readability

### Schema Discovery
Before querying unfamiliar tables:
```sql
desc system.{table_name}
```

---

## Standard Diagnostics Entry Point

When user asks for general health check, run these in order:

### 1. System Overview
```sql
select
    hostName() as host,
    version() as version,
    uptime() as uptime_seconds,
    formatReadableTimeDelta(uptime()) as uptime
```

### 2. Current Activity
```sql
select
    count() as active_queries,
    sum(memory_usage) as total_memory,
    formatReadableSize(sum(memory_usage)) as memory_readable
from system.processes
where is_cancelled = 0
```

### 3. Part Health (quick)
```sql
select
    database,
    table,
    count() as parts,
    sum(rows) as rows
from system.parts
where active
group by database, table
order by parts desc
limit 10
```

### 4. Recent Errors (quick)
```sql
select
    toStartOfHour(event_time) as hour,
    count() as error_count
from system.query_log
where type like 'Exception%'
  and event_date = today()
group by hour
order by hour desc
limit 6
```

Then based on findings, load specific modules.

## Information Sources Priority

1. **System tables via MCP** (primary source)
2. **Module-specific queries** (predefined patterns)
3. **ClickHouse docs**: https://clickhouse.com/docs/
4. **Altinity KB**: https://kb.altinity.com/
5. **GitHub issues**: https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues

---

## Response Guidelines

- Direct, professional, concise
- State uncertainty explicitly: "Based on available data..." or "Cannot determine without..."
- Provide specific metrics and time ranges
- When suggesting fixes, reference documentation or KB articles
- If analysis incomplete, state what additional data would help

```

Load modules with skill invocation: `/altinity-expert-clickhouse-{name}`

## Audit Severity Levels

All modules use consistent severity classification:

| Severity | Meaning | Action Timeline |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Critical | Immediate risk of failure/data loss | Fix now |
| Major | Significant performance/stability impact | Fix this week |
| Moderate | Suboptimal, will degrade over time | Plan fix |
| Minor | Best practice violation, low impact | Nice to have |
| OK/None | Passes check | No action needed |

## Query Output Patterns

Modules provide three types of queries:

1. **Audit Queries** - Return severity-rated findings:
   - Columns: `object`, `severity`, `details`
   - Run these first for quick assessment

2. **Diagnostic Queries** - Raw data inspection:
   - Current state without severity rating
   - Use for investigation

3. **Ad-Hoc Guidelines** - Rules for safe exploration:
   - Required safeguards (LIMIT, time bounds)
   - Useful patterns
