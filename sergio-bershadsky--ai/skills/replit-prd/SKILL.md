# Replit PRD Generator

Create comprehensive Product Requirements Documents optimized for Replit Agent to build complex applications.

## When to Use

- Building complex applications with multiple features
- Need stakeholder alignment before development
- Want one-shot autonomous builds (entire app from single prompt)
- Require clear acceptance criteria and testing plans
- Working on team projects that need documentation

## PRD vs Simple Prompt

| Aspect | Simple Prompt | Full PRD |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Features | 1-3 | 4+ |
| Pages/Screens | 1-3 | 4+ |
| User Roles | 1 | Multiple |
| Integrations | 0-1 | Multiple |
| Development Time | < 1 hour | Hours to days |
| Iterations Expected | Minimal | Multiple phases |

**Rule of thumb:** If you can describe it in 10 lines, use a prompt. If you need structure, use a PRD.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Gather High-Level Requirements

Ask the user:
1. What is the product and who is it for?
2. What are the 3-5 most important features?
3. Any specific tech requirements or preferences?
4. Any reference apps or designs to emulate?

### Step 2: Define User Personas

For each user type:
- Who are they?
- What do they need to accomplish?
- What's their technical skill level?

### Step 3: Detail Features

For each feature, extract:
- User stories
- UI components needed
- Data required
- API endpoints
- Validation rules
- Error scenarios

### Step 4: Design Data Model

- List all entities
- Define all fields with types and constraints
- Map relationships
- Identify required indexes

### Step 5: Specify UI/UX

- Color palette
- Page layouts
- Navigation structure
- Responsive behavior
- Key interactions

### Step 6: Define User Flows

Document step-by-step:
- Happy path
- Error paths
- Edge cases

### Step 7: Set Acceptance Criteria

Create testable checkboxes for:
- Each feature
- Overall functionality
- Performance requirements

### Step 8: Plan Development Phases

Break into 3-4 phases with:
- Clear goals
- Specific deliverables
- Checkpoint criteria

### Step 9: Present Draft PRD

```
## PRD Draft: [Product Name]

**Complexity:** [Low/Medium/High]
**Estimated Phases:** [Number]
**Primary Persona:** [Name]

---

[Full PRD content]

## Usage Instructions

1. Copy entire PRD to Replit Agent
2. Use Plan Mode first to review Agent's approach
3. Approve plan and start Phase 1
4. Create checkpoint after each phase
5. Review and iterate before next phase

Ready to proceed?
```

### Step 10: Provide Iteration Guidance

After PRD delivery:
- How to use Plan Mode effectively
- When to create checkpoints
- How to handle deviations

## Output Format

```
# [Product Name] PRD

## Quick Reference

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Complexity | [Low/Medium/High] |
| Features | [Count] |
| Pages | [Count] |
| API Endpoints | [Count] |
| Phases | [Count] |

## Replit Agent Instructions

**Mode:** Start in Plan Mode

**Phase 1 Prompt:**
"Review this PRD and create a development plan for Phase 1: [Phase 1 Goal].
Don't start building yet - just outline your approach."

**Build Prompt (after plan approval):**
"Proceed with Phase 1 implementation. Create a checkpoint when complete."

**Subsequent Phases:**
Repeat plan → build → checkpoint cycle for each phase.
```

## Rules

1. **ALWAYS include acceptance criteria** — Every feature needs testable conditions
2. **ALWAYS define data model** — Schema before code
3. **ALWAYS specify error handling** — Every feature's error scenarios
4. **ALWAYS break into phases** — 3-4 phases with clear checkpoints
5. **NEVER leave fields vague** — Every input has type, constraints, validation
6. **NEVER skip security requirements** — Always include security section
7. **PREFER reference apps** — Concrete examples over abstract descriptions
