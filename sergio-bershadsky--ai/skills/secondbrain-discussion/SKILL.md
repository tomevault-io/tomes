# Document Discussion

Capture team discussions with participants, decisions, and action items.

## Prerequisites

Verify Discussions entity is enabled:
1. Check for `.claude/data/discussions/schema.yaml`
2. If not found, suggest enabling discussions via `secondbrain-init`

## Important Rules

- **Do NOT add discussions to the left sidebar/navigation.** Discussions are listed automatically via the `EntityTable` component on `docs/discussions/index.md`, which reads from monthly `.claude/data/discussions/YYYY-MM.yaml` files. No sidebar modification is needed.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Information

Collect from user or conversation context:

1. **Participant(s)** — Who was in the discussion
2. **Topic** — Main subject discussed
3. **Source** — manual, meeting, slack
4. **Key Points** — Discussion content
5. **Decisions** — What was decided
6. **Action Items** — Follow-up tasks

### Step 2: Generate Discussion File

**Filename format:** `docs/discussions/YYYY-MM-DD-<participant>-<topic-slug>.md`

Example: `docs/discussions/2026-01-15-sergey-kubernetes-migration.md`

### Step 3: Create Discussion Document

```markdown
---
date: 2026-01-15
participants:
  - Sergey Bershadsky
  - Kate Angelopoulos
topic: Kubernetes Migration Planning
status: documented
source: meeting
tags: [kubernetes, infrastructure, planning]

### Step 4: Update Records

Add to monthly file `.claude/data/discussions/YYYY-MM.yaml`:

```yaml
- date: 2026-01-15
  member: sergey
  topic: Kubernetes Migration Planning
  file: docs/discussions/2026-01-15-sergey-kubernetes-migration.md
  source: meeting
  participants:
    - Sergey Bershadsky
    - Kate Angelopoulos
```

### Step 5: Sidebar Note

**DO NOT manually add discussions to VitePress sidebar.**

Discussions are automatically listed via the `EntityTable` component on `docs/discussions/index.md`, which reads from monthly `.claude/data/discussions/YYYY-MM.yaml` files. No sidebar modification needed.

### Step 6: Confirm Creation

```
## Discussion Documented

**Date:** 2026-01-15
**Topic:** Kubernetes Migration Planning
**Participants:** Sergey Bershadsky, Kate Angelopoulos
**Source:** meeting
**File:** docs/discussions/2026-01-15-sergey-kubernetes-migration.md

### Summary
- 2 decisions recorded
- 3 action items created
- 2 open questions noted

### Next Steps
- Follow up on action items
- Address open questions in next discussion
```

## Monthly Partitioning

Discussions are partitioned by month:
- `discussions/2025-12.yaml` — December 2025
- `discussions/2026-01.yaml` — January 2026

Past months become immutable, preserving history.

## Sources

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| manual | Hand-documented discussion |
| meeting | From a scheduled meeting |
| slack | From Slack conversation |

## Tips

1. **Capture decisions explicitly** — Use the table format
2. **Create action items** — Every decision should have an owner
3. **Note open questions** — Track what needs follow-up
4. **Link to related content** — Reference ADRs, notes, etc.
5. **Document context** — Future readers need to understand "why"
