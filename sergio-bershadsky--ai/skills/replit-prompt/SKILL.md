# Replit Prompt Generator

Transform requirements into optimized prompts for Replit Agent that maximize AI understanding and minimize iterations.

## When to Use

- User wants to build something with Replit Agent
- User needs to convert an idea into a Replit-ready prompt
- User wants to improve an existing Replit prompt
- User is preparing to start a new Replit project

## Core Principles (Replit's Official Guidelines)

### 1. Checkpoint — Structure Iteratively
Break large goals into smaller, testable steps. Use checkpoints between phases.

### 2. Debug — Provide Detailed Context
Include exact error messages, relevant code snippets, and steps already attempted.

### 3. Discover — Ask for Suggestions
Request tool/library recommendations when unsure about approach.

### 4. Experiment — Iterate on Prompts
Refine requests by adjusting wording or adding detail.

### 5. Instruct — Use Positive Goals
Frame as "do this" rather than "don't do that".

### 6. Select — Focused Context
Provide relevant context only; avoid overwhelming with unrelated information.

### 7. Show — Concrete Examples
Reduce ambiguity with code snippets, mockups, or reference apps.

### 8. Simplify — Concise Language
Use direct, short sentences. Avoid jargon.

### 9. Specify — Define Outputs
State expected outputs, constraints, data formats, and edge cases.

### 10. Test — Plan First
Outline features, data structures, and user flows before prompting.

## Prompt Structure Template

When generating prompts for Replit, use this structure:

```markdown
## Project Overview
[1-2 sentences: What is being built and its core purpose]

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: [specific framework/library]
- Backend: [specific framework/language]
- Database: [specific database]
- Authentication: [specific method]
- Additional: [any other required tools/APIs]

## Core Features
1. [Feature 1]: [specific description with expected behavior]
2. [Feature 2]: [specific description with expected behavior]
3. [Feature 3]: [specific description with expected behavior]

## UI/UX Requirements
- Design style: [modern/minimal/material/etc.]
- Color scheme: [specific colors or "neutral professional"]
- Layout: [sidebar/top-nav/dashboard/etc.]
- Responsive: [yes/no, breakpoints if specific]

## Data Model
[Describe main entities and their relationships]
- Entity1: field1, field2, field3
- Entity2: field1, field2 (relates to Entity1)

## User Flows
1. [Flow 1]: Step A → Step B → Step C → Result
2. [Flow 2]: Step A → Step B → Result

## Constraints
- [Constraint 1: e.g., "Must work offline"]
- [Constraint 2: e.g., "No external API calls except X"]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] [Specific testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Specific testable criterion 2]
- [ ] [Specific testable criterion 3]
```

## Procedure

### Step 1: Gather Requirements

Ask the user about:
1. **What** they want to build (core functionality)
2. **Who** will use it (target users)
3. **How** it should work (key user flows)
4. **Why** (problem being solved)

If user provides vague input, ask clarifying questions:
- "What should happen when a user clicks X?"
- "Should data persist between sessions?"
- "Any specific design/framework preferences?"

### Step 2: Extract Technical Details

Determine from user input or ask about:
- Preferred tech stack (or let Replit decide)
- Authentication requirements
- Data storage needs
- Third-party integrations
- Performance requirements

### Step 3: Structure the Prompt

Transform gathered information into the structured template above.

**Bad prompt transformation:**
```
❌ Bad: "Make a website for my business"
✅ Good: "Create a portfolio website for a freelance photographer with:
- Home page with hero image carousel
- Gallery page with filterable photo categories
- Contact form with email integration
- About page with bio and testimonials
- Tech: React, TailwindCSS, EmailJS for form
- Design: Clean, minimal, lots of whitespace"
```

### Step 4: Add Specificity

Enhance the prompt with:
- **Concrete examples**: "Like Stripe's dashboard layout"
- **Specific behaviors**: "Click 'Add' opens modal, not new page"
- **Edge cases**: "If cart is empty, show 'Start shopping' CTA"
- **Validation rules**: "Email must be valid format, password min 8 chars"

### Step 5: Present Draft

Show the optimized prompt to the user:

```
## Replit Agent Prompt

**Optimized for:** [Build Mode / Plan Mode]
**Estimated complexity:** [Low / Medium / High]

---

[Generated prompt content]

---

**Recommendations:**
1. [Tip for using this prompt effectively]
2. [Suggested follow-up prompts after initial build]

Ready to copy to Replit?
```

Wait for user confirmation or modification requests.

### Step 6: Provide Iteration Guidance

After delivering the prompt, advise on:
- Using Plan Mode first for complex features
- Setting up checkpoints between phases
- Follow-up prompts for refinements

## Output Format

```
## Replit Agent Prompt

**Mode:** Build / Plan
**Complexity:** Low / Medium / High

---

[Structured prompt following template]

---

## Next Steps

1. **Initial Build**: Copy prompt to Replit Agent
2. **After MVP**: [Suggested enhancement prompt]
3. **Testing**: [What to verify after build]

## Checkpoint Strategy

Phase 1: [Description] → Checkpoint
Phase 2: [Description] → Checkpoint
Phase 3: [Description] → Checkpoint
```

## Bad vs Good Prompt Examples

| Issue | Bad Prompt | Good Prompt |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Vague | "Fix my code" | "The login function in auth.js throws 'undefined user' on line 42 when email contains '+'" |
| No scope | "Make a website" | "Create a 3-page portfolio: Home (hero, skills), Projects (grid with filters), Contact (form)" |
| Negative | "Don't make it slow" | "Implement lazy loading for images, paginate lists to 20 items" |
| No detail | "Add animation" | "Fade in hero text on page load over 0.5s, slide in cards from bottom on scroll" |
| Overwhelming | "Build the entire backend" | "Implement user signup/login with JWT and a /api/profile GET endpoint" |

## Rules

1. **ALWAYS use positive framing** — "Do X" not "Don't do Y"
2. **ALWAYS include tech stack** — Even if "let Replit decide"
3. **ALWAYS define success criteria** — Testable checkboxes
4. **ALWAYS break into phases** — For anything beyond simple apps
5. **NEVER use vague terms** — No "nice", "good", "fast", "modern" without specifics
6. **NEVER assume context** — Replit Agent has no prior knowledge
