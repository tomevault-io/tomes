# Replit Task Planner

Break down projects into iterative development phases with checkpoints optimized for Replit Agent's workflow.

## When to Use

- Converting a large project into manageable phases
- Planning checkpoint strategy for complex builds
- Creating iterative prompts from a PRD or idea
- Structuring work for Replit Agent's extended autonomy mode

## Replit Agent Modes

### Build Mode (Default)
- Agent writes code directly
- Best for: Implementation, coding, fixing bugs
- Creates checkpoints automatically

### Plan Mode
- Agent discusses without modifying code
- Best for: Architecture decisions, exploring approaches, reviewing PRDs
- Free (no checkpoint charges)

### Edit Mode
- Agent makes targeted changes to specific files
- Best for: Precise modifications, refactoring specific sections

## Checkpoint Strategy

Replit Agent creates checkpoints after each prompt. Effective planning means:

1. **One checkpoint = one logical unit of work**
2. **Each phase should be testable independently**
3. **Phases build on each other sequentially**
4. **Rollback-friendly boundaries**

## Task Breakdown Template

```markdown
# [Project Name] - Development Plan

## Overview
**Project:** [Brief description]
**Total Phases:** [Number]
**Estimated Checkpoints:** [Number]

---

## Phase 1: [Phase Name]
**Goal:** [One sentence describing what's achieved]
**Dependencies:** None (starting point)

### Tasks
1. [Specific task 1]
2. [Specific task 2]
3. [Specific task 3]

### Deliverables
- [ ] [Testable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Testable outcome 2]

### Prompt for Replit Agent
```
[Phase goal description]. Specifically:
1. [Task 1 with details]
2. [Task 2 with details]

## Rollback Points
- After Phase 1: [What's safe to rollback to]
- After Phase 2: [What's safe to rollback to]

## Risk Mitigation
| Risk | Phase | Mitigation |
|------|-------|------------|
| [Risk] | [Phase #] | [How to handle] |
```

## Procedure

### Step 1: Understand the Project

Gather from user:
1. What is being built?
2. What are all the features/requirements?
3. Any dependencies between features?
4. Are there external integrations?

### Step 2: Identify Natural Boundaries

Look for:
- **Setup vs Features** — Config/auth first, then features
- **Independent Features** — Features that don't depend on each other
- **Dependent Features** — Features that require others to exist
- **Polish vs Core** — Error handling, edge cases last

### Step 3: Create Phases

**Phase 1: Foundation**
Always start with:
- Project setup
- Database schema
- Authentication (if needed)
- Basic navigation/layout

**Phase 2-N: Core Features**
Group related functionality:
- One major feature per phase
- Include its UI, API, and data needs
- Keep phases 30-60 minutes of Agent work

**Final Phase: Polish**
Always end with:
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Edge cases
- Responsive fixes
- Final testing

### Step 4: Write Prompts for Each Phase

Each prompt should:
- State the goal clearly
- List specific tasks (numbered)
- Include technical details
- Request a stop point for review

**Template:**
```
Implement [Feature Name].

Requirements:
1. [Specific requirement with details]
2. [Specific requirement with details]
3. [Specific requirement with details]

Technical notes:
- [Relevant constraint or approach]
- [Relevant constraint or approach]

Create a checkpoint when complete so I can review before the next phase.
```

### Step 5: Define Verification Steps

For each phase, include how to verify:
- What to click/test in the UI
- What API calls to make
- What database records to check

### Step 6: Present the Plan

```
## Development Plan: [Project Name]

**Phases:** [Number]
**Approach:** [Brief strategy explanation]

---

[Full plan with all phases]

---

## How to Use This Plan

1. **Start with Plan Mode**: Copy Phase 1 prompt, select Plan Mode
2. **Review Agent's approach**: Ensure it aligns with expectations
3. **Switch to Build Mode**: Approve and let Agent implement
4. **Verify at checkpoint**: Test deliverables before continuing
5. **Proceed to next phase**: Copy next prompt and repeat

## Iteration Strategy
If issues arise:
- Minor issues: Describe and ask Agent to fix in current phase
- Major issues: Rollback to previous checkpoint, refine prompt, retry

## Phase Sizing Guidelines

| Phase Size | Work Amount | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| Small | 15-30 min | Add a single form with validation |
| Medium | 30-60 min | Full CRUD for one entity |
| Large | 60-90 min | Feature with UI + API + data |

**Ideal phase:** Medium (30-60 minutes)

**Signs phase is too large:**
- More than 5 major tasks
- Touches more than 4-5 files
- Multiple unrelated features
- "Build the entire X" language

**Signs phase is too small:**
- Single task that takes < 10 minutes
- No testable deliverable
- Could easily be combined with adjacent phase

## Common Phase Patterns

### Pattern 1: CRUD Feature
```
Phase N: [Entity] Management
1. Database model and migrations
2. API endpoints (list, create, read, update, delete)
3. List view with table/cards
4. Create/edit form (modal or page)
5. Delete with confirmation

Deliverables:
- [ ] Can create new [entity]
- [ ] Can view list of [entities]
- [ ] Can edit existing [entity]
- [ ] Can delete [entity]
```

### Pattern 2: Authentication
```
Phase 1: Authentication Setup
1. Configure auth provider (Supabase/Clerk/etc.)
2. Create signup page with form
3. Create login page with form
4. Add protected route wrapper
5. Add user context/hook
6. Add logout functionality

Deliverables:
- [ ] New user can sign up
- [ ] Existing user can log in
- [ ] Protected pages redirect to login
- [ ] User can log out
```

### Pattern 3: Dashboard
```
Phase N: Dashboard
1. Create dashboard layout
2. Add metric cards with data fetching
3. Add recent activity list
4. Add quick action buttons
5. Implement responsive grid

Deliverables:
- [ ] Dashboard loads with correct data
- [ ] Metrics update when data changes
- [ ] Recent activity shows latest items
- [ ] Layout works on mobile
```

### Pattern 4: External Integration
```
Phase N: [Service] Integration
1. Set up environment variables for API keys
2. Create service wrapper/client
3. Implement core integration function
4. Add error handling for API failures
5. Connect to UI trigger point

Deliverables:
- [ ] API key configuration works
- [ ] Integration function returns expected data
- [ ] Errors handled gracefully
- [ ] UI reflects integration state
```

3. Add empty states:
   - No todos: "No todos yet. Add one above!"
   - No results: "No todos match your search"
   - No category selected + no todos: "Select a category or add a todo"

4. Add loading spinner for initial data fetch
5. Add error toast for API failures
6. Responsive adjustments:
   - Mobile: hide sidebar, add hamburger menu

## Rollback Points
- After Phase 1: Clean slate with just structure
- After Phase 2: Categories work, can redo todo implementation
- After Phase 3: Full functionality, can redo polish

## Risk Mitigation
| Risk | Phase | Mitigation |
|------|-------|------------|
| Prisma schema issues | 1 | Test migration before proceeding |
| Filter state complexity | 3 | Use URL params for filter state |
| Mobile responsive issues | 4 | Test each breakpoint individually |
```

```

## Rules

1. **ALWAYS start with foundation phase** — Setup, schema, auth first
2. **ALWAYS end with polish phase** — Error handling, edge cases last
3. **ALWAYS include verification steps** — Testable deliverables per phase
4. **ALWAYS size phases appropriately** — 30-60 minutes ideal
5. **NEVER combine unrelated features** — One major feature per phase
6. **NEVER skip rollback planning** — Document safe rollback points
7. **PREFER explicit prompts** — Include technical details in each phase prompt
