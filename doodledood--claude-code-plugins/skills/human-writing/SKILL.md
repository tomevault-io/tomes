**User request**: $ARGUMENTS

Apply these research-backed writing principles to the current task. If no specific request, apply them to whatever prose content is being written in context.

## The Core Insight

**The fundamental problem is statistical uniformity.** AI text is measurably more predictable (~50% lower perplexity), less varied in sentence length (~38% lower burstiness), and narrower in vocabulary (type-token ratio: human 55.3 vs AI 45.5). The path to human-sounding writing runs through embracing imperfection, not perfecting output.

**The single most reliable tell is uniformity.** Human writing is messy, varied, and surprising. AI writing is smooth, consistent, and predictable.

## The 10-20-70 Rule

Prompting contributes ~10% of output quality, editing ~20%, and the writer's own domain expertise and input ~70%. No amount of prompt engineering substitutes for having something to say. Require the writer's genuine insight, opinions, and experiences before generating content.

## Hierarchy of Impact

From highest to lowest impact on making writing sound human:

| Priority | Technique | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| 1 | **Put your own thinking in first** | AI cannot generate genuine insight, lived experience, or original analysis |
| 2 | **Develop a distinctive voice** | Voice is the ultimate differentiator — consistent, cannot be faked by editing |
| 3 | **Edit ruthlessly** | Four-layer system: word → sentence → structure → content |
| 4 | **Design the workflow** | Never write a complete piece in one shot |
| 5 | **Prompt with constraints** | Banned words + persona + writing samples |
| 6 | **Embrace imperfection** | Fragments. Tangents. Opinions. Rough edges make writing alive. |

## Vocabulary Kill-List

Never use these words — they are statistically flagged as AI-generated across peer-reviewed studies of millions of documents:

**Nouns**: delve, tapestry, landscape, realm, testament, journey, insight, resilience, ecosystem, milestone, prowess, utilization

**Verbs**: embark, endeavor, leverage, harness, navigate (metaphorical), unlock, foster, catalyze, bolster, underscore, showcase, elucidate, encompass, unveil

**Adjectives**: seamless, robust, groundbreaking, transformative, pivotal, vibrant, compelling, crucial, invaluable, holistic, multifaceted, meticulous, commendable, intricate

**Adverbs**: seamlessly, meticulously, notably, profoundly, predominantly, subsequently, thereby, ultimately

**Phrases**: "ever-evolving landscape," "in today's fast-paced world," "as we navigate the complexities," "It isn't just X, it's Y," "it's important to note," "it's worth noting that," "without further ado," "in conclusion," "at the heart of"

**False intensifiers**: "genuinely," "truly," "actually" (when used to simulate conviction)

## Four-Layer Editing System

Apply in order from surface to substance:

### Layer 1: Word-Level
Search-replace or delete kill-list vocabulary on sight. Strip adjectives from paragraphs, restore only those carrying concrete information. "Robust system" → "handles 10k req/s without data loss."

### Layer 2: Sentence-Level
Read only the first few words of consecutive sentences — wherever three or more follow the same pattern, cut or combine. Vary sentence length deliberately: short for punch, long for nuance. The contrast creates impact. Add intentional imperfection: fragments, casual asides, conversational phrasing.

### Layer 3: Structural
Eliminate meta-commentary ("In this section, we will..."). Kill recap conclusions that only repeat earlier points. Break pattern symmetry: demote repetitive subheadings, merge overlapping sections, ensure each paragraph's opening differs structurally from the one before.

### Layer 4: Content
Add lived experience: anecdotes, firsthand observations, specific failures. Ground in specifics — ask of every sentence: "Could this fit any topic?" If yes, it needs grounding. Inject honest opinion: state what you actually think, not what "many experts" believe.

### Final Check
**Read aloud.** Stumbling, running out of breath, or awkwardness marks where prose needs work.

## Seven Craft Fundamentals AI Structurally Cannot Produce

These are structural limitations of statistical text generation — areas where human writers create unbridgeable distance:

1. **Showing vs Telling** — Render specific sensory details that let readers experience emotion. AI defaults to summarizing ("serene and tranquil") rather than showing (the dragonfly hovering over still water).

2. **Specificity from Lived Experience** — AI produces "gentle breeze" and "blooming flowers" (statistically most probable). Replace generic descriptions with observations nobody else has made. Name the cafe, the specific dish, the particular moment.

3. **Strategic Omission** — AI tends toward completeness and closure. Resonant writing lives in what's left unsaid. A character dodging a question reveals more than any direct statement. Trained to produce text, not withhold it.

4. **Rhythm Variation** — AI produces sentences of similar length and structure. Use rhythm deliberately: shorten sentences as tension rises. Drop a short sentence after several long ones. Like that.

5. **Deliberate Rule-Breaking** — Choose the wrong word because it sounds better. Let a fragment hang. Incomplete sentences. For emphasis. Because sometimes a complete sentence kills the moment.

6. **Humor** — Classified as an "AI-complete problem." Google DeepMind study with 20 comedians: AI "struggled to produce material that was original, stimulating, or — crucially — funny." Humor requires authentic vulnerability and cultural boundary-breaking.

7. **Genuine Insight** — AI provides summaries; humans provide analysis. Keep asking "Why?" iteratively. Data shows the "what" — insight tells the "why."

## Structural Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Tell | Fix |
|---------|------|-----|
| Uniform paragraph length | Every section gets equal treatment regardless of importance | Spend more space on what matters, less on what doesn't |
| List addiction | Jumping into numbered/bulleted lists without narrative buildup | Use flowing prose; lists only when genuinely parallel |
| Formulaic scaffolding | "Firstly... Secondly... Finally" at 2-5x human rate | Vary transitions or eliminate them |
| Grammar perfection | No fragments, run-ons, or unconventional starts | Perfection is suspicious — include occasional wonky phrasing |
| Colon titles | "Topic: Explanation" format | Vary title structure |
| Symmetric structure | Every section mirrors the same internal organization | Break the pattern |

## Punctuation and Formatting Rules

- **Em-dashes (—) and en-dashes (–)**: One of the most reliable AI tells. ChatGPT uses 8 per 573 words; Deepseek 9 per 555 words. Ban them entirely — use commas, periods, parentheses, or colons instead.
- **Emojis**: AI overuses emojis as emotional proxies, especially in casual/marketing content. Never add emojis unless the user explicitly requests them. Excessive emoji use signals AI generation immediately.
- **Semicolons**: AI rarely uses them. Including some adds human texture.
- **Contractions**: AI avoids them. Use them freely in conversational prose.
- **Oxford commas**: AI applies them consistently. Break the pattern occasionally.

## Rhetorical Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Tell | Fix |
|---------|------|-----|
| **Tricolon obsession** | Groups ideas in threes: "Time, resources, and attention" | Break with two, four, or seven items erratically |
| **Perfect antithesis** | "Not just X, but Y" — neat binary oppositions | Real arguments are messier |
| **Rhetorical questions as staging** | "How do we solve this?" → pre-composed answer | Ask genuine questions or just state the point |
| **Excessive hedging** | "may potentially offer what could be considered significant benefits" | Strip to: "this works" |
| **Compulsive signposting** | "It's worth noting," "It's important to remember" | Trust the reader |
| **Opinion-avoidant framing** | "commonly described as," "many find," "generally considered" | State the view directly |

## Tonal Principles

- **Vary register.** AI picks a lane and stays there. Shift between formal and colloquial. Reveal personality through tonal variation.
- **Don't be relentlessly positive.** AI frames everything positively. Call things weak, inadequate, or bad when they are.
- **Show unequal enthusiasm.** AI treats all subjects with equal professional distance. Nerd out about topics you care about. Show visible impatience with boring ones.
- **Take risks.** AI prioritizes broad palatability. Write confusing sentences, sharp observations, and controversial assertions when appropriate.

## What Must Be Present (The Negative Space)

AI text is identified as much by what's absent as what's present:

- **Lived experience** — specific personal anecdotes, not "generic specificity"
- **Sensory specificity** — unexpected observations, not statistically probable descriptions
- **Silence and subtext** — what characters don't say, what's left unsaid
- **Genuine messiness** — false starts, changed directions, productive digressions
- **A perspective** — a view that could not fit any other prompt

## Prompting Techniques (When Generating)

### Tier 1 (Strongest evidence)
- **Banned word lists**: Prohibit the kill-list vocabulary explicitly. Constraint-based prompting outperforms aspirational instructions.
- **Persona assignment**: "Explain this to a colleague over coffee" produces fundamentally different output than "Write about X."
- **Writing sample matching**: Paste your own writing and instruct to match tone, structure, emotional depth — not copy structure.

### Tier 2 (Good evidence)
- **Conversational framing**: Frame as conversations, not commands.
- **Negative instructions**: "Don't use formal transitions. Don't start paragraphs with 'It is worth noting.'"
- **Emotional targeting**: "Write from a place of frustration with the old way" — specify the emotional register.

### Tier 3 (Supporting evidence)
- **Short sentence requests**: Counteracts multi-clause tendency.
- **Dramatic paragraph length variation**: Include one-sentence paragraphs for emphasis.
- **Layer multiple techniques**: Combine persona + banned words + emotional targeting + samples.

## Workflow Principles

- **Never write a complete piece in one shot.** Section-by-section with review between.
- **Bookend approach**: AI for ideation at start, polish at end. Human controls the core creative middle.
- **Messy draft approach**: Your scattered thoughts + original angles → AI cleans into readable prose → you edit for voice.
- **Your original thinking goes IN before AI touches it.**

## Statistical Signatures (Detection Context)

Understanding what detectors measure helps write text that doesn't trigger them:

| Metric | Human | AI | Meaning |
|--------|-------|-----|---------|
| Perplexity (surprisal) | ~8.2 | ~4.2 | AI is ~50% more predictable |
| Burstiness (sentence variation) | 0.61 | 0.38 | AI has ~38% less variation |
| Token probability entropy | 4.56 | 3.11 | AI makes more uniform word choices (d=3.08) |
| Type-token ratio | 55.3 | 45.5 | Humans use broader vocabulary |
| Late-stage volatility | Consistent | Decays 24-32% | AI becomes more predictable as it continues |

**Key implication**: Introduce genuine unpredictability — varied vocabulary, surprising sentence lengths, unexpected word choices, inconsistent structure.

## Detection Methods (Reference)

- **Statistical/zero-shot**: Perplexity, burstiness, entropy, probability curvature (DetectGPT), cross-perplexity ratio (Binoculars), directional memorization (BiScope)
- **Trained classifiers**: GPTZero, Originality.ai, Turnitin, Copyleaks — achieve 65-96% on unedited AI text
- **Watermarking**: Vocabulary partitioning, SynthID tournament sampling
- **Stylometric**: Type-token ratio, stop word count, hapax legomenon rate
- **What defeats detection**: Paraphrasing (reduces by 87-99%), simple modifications, human editing, nucleus sampling
- **Theoretical limit**: Detection converges toward random chance as models improve (Sadasivan et al.)

## Model-Specific Signatures

| Model | Key Tells |
|-------|-----------|
| **ChatGPT** | Formal, clinical; heavy em-dashes (8/573 words); overuses "delve," "align," "noteworthy"; dry, robotic |
| **Gemini** | Conversational, explanatory; prefers simple language; no em-dash overuse |
| **Claude** | More natural and literary; minimal em-dashes (2/948 words); tonal flexibility; occasionally generates fiction unprompted |
| **Deepseek** | Heavy em-dashes (9/555 words); similar to ChatGPT structurally |
