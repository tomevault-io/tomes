description: Deep web research with parallel investigators, multi-wave exploration, and structured synthesis. Spawns multiple web-researcher agents to explore different facets of a topic simultaneously, launches additional waves when gaps are identified, then synthesizes findings. Use when asked to research, investigate, compare options, find best practices, or gather comprehensive information from the web.\n\nThoroughness: quick for factual lookups | medium for focused topics | thorough for comparisons/evaluations (waves continue while critical gaps remain) | very-thorough for comprehensive research (waves continue until satisficed). Auto-selects if not specified. Use when this capability is needed.

**Research request**: $ARGUMENTS

# Thoroughness Level

**FIRST**: Determine thoroughness before researching. Parse from natural language or auto-select.

**Auto-selection logic**:
- Single fact/definition/date → quick
- Focused question about one topic → medium
- Comparison, evaluation, or "best" questions → thorough
- "comprehensive"/"all options"/"complete analysis"/"deep dive" → very-thorough

**Explicit user preference**: Honor user-specified level regardless of other triggers.

**Trigger conflicts (auto-selection only)**: Use highest level indicated.

| Level | Agents/Wave | Wave Policy | Behavior | Triggers |
|-------|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **quick** | 1 | Single wave | Single web-researcher, no orchestration file, direct answer | "what is", "when did", factual lookups, definitions |
| **medium** | 1-2 | Single wave | Orchestration file, focused research on 1-2 angles | specific how-to, single technology, focused question |
| **thorough** | 2-4 | Continue while critical gaps remain | Full logging, parallel agents, cross-reference, follow-up waves | "compare", "best options", "evaluate", "pros and cons" |
| **very-thorough** | 4-6 | Continue until comprehensive OR diminishing returns | Multi-wave until all significant gaps addressed | "comprehensive", "complete analysis", "all alternatives", "deep dive" |

**Multi-wave**: For thorough/very-thorough, waves continue until satisficing criteria are met. No hard maximum — waves continue as long as productive and gaps remain.

**Agent count scaling**: Match agent count to genuine research facets, not perceived thoroughness. Each agent should have a distinct domain justifying dedicated research. Over-spawning wastes resources; under-spawning misses facets.

| Task Complexity | Agents | Rationale |
|----------------|--------|-----------|
| Simple fact-check | 1 | Single angle sufficient |
| Direct comparison (2-3 options) | 2-3 | One per option or dimension |
| Multi-facet evaluation | 3-5 | One per orthogonal facet |
| Comprehensive landscape | 5-7 | Cover all major dimensions |

**Ambiguous queries**: If thoroughness cannot be determined AND query is complex, ask:

```
I can research this at different depths:
- **medium**: Focused research on core aspects (~3-5 min)
- **thorough**: Multi-angle investigation with cross-referencing (~8-12 min)
- **very-thorough**: Comprehensive analysis covering all facets (~15-20 min)

Which level would you prefer?
```

State: `**Thoroughness**: [level] — [reason]` then proceed.

# Orchestration

Orchestrate parallel web researchers through iterative waves, then synthesize findings.

**Loop**: Determine thoroughness → Decompose → Launch Wave 1 → Collect → Cross-reference → Evaluate gaps → [If gaps + productive: next wave] → Synthesize → Output

**Orchestration file**: `/tmp/research-orchestration-{topic-slug}-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}.md` — external memory for tracking multi-wave progress.

- **Topic-slug**: 2-4 key terms (nouns/adjectives), lowercase, hyphens. Exclude articles, prepositions, generic words.
- **Timestamp**: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` via `date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S`.

# Satisficing Criteria

## Wave Continuation

| Level | Continue When | Stop When (Satisficed) |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|
| quick | N/A | Always single wave |
| medium | N/A | Always single wave |
| thorough | Critical gaps remain AND previous wave productive AND ≤50% source overlap | No critical gaps OR diminishing returns OR >50% source overlap |
| very-thorough | Significant gaps remain AND previous wave productive AND ≤50% source overlap | No significant gaps OR diminishing returns OR >50% source overlap |

**Source overlap**: % of sources in current wave also cited in prior waves. >50% = cycling through same sources.

## Gap Classification

| Gap Type | Definition | Triggers New Wave? |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Critical** | Core question unanswered, major conflict unresolved, key comparison missing | Yes (thorough, very-thorough) |
| **Significant** | Important facet unexplored, partial answer needs depth, newly discovered area | Yes (very-thorough only) |
| **Minor** | Nice-to-have detail, edge case, tangential | No — note in limitations |

## Satisficing Evaluation

**Definitions**:
- **Finding**: Distinct information answering part of the question, with source citation.
- **Substantive finding**: New information not already established in prior waves.
- **High-authority source**: Official docs, peer-reviewed research, established publications, recognized domain experts.
- **Independent sources**: Different underlying information origins. Two articles citing the same study = one source.
- **High confidence**: ≥3 independent sources OR ≥2 high-authority sources.
- **Medium confidence**: 2 independent sources OR 1 high-authority source.
- **Low confidence**: Single non-authoritative source, no corroboration.

**Satisficed when ANY true**:
- All critical gaps addressed (thorough) OR all significant gaps addressed (very-thorough)
- Diminishing returns: <2 new substantive findings AND no confidence increased AND no new areas
- User requested stopping
- All facets at medium+ confidence

**Continue when ALL true**:
- Gaps at triggering threshold (thorough: critical; very-thorough: significant)
- Previous wave productive (≥2 findings OR confidence improved OR new areas)
- ≤50% source overlap with prior waves

# Phase 1: Initial Setup (skip for quick)

## 1.1 Get timestamp & create todos

Run `date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S` and `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`.

Todos = research areas + write-to-log operations. List grows during decomposition.

```
- [ ] Create orchestration file
- [ ] Topic decomposition→log
- [ ] (expand: research facets as decomposition reveals)
- [ ] Launch Wave 1 agents
- [ ] Collect Wave 1 findings→log
- [ ] Cross-reference→log
- [ ] Evaluate gaps→log
- [ ] (expand: Wave 2+ if continuing)
- [ ] Refresh: read full orchestration file
- [ ] Synthesize→final output
```

**Critical todos** (never skip): `→log` after each phase/agent; `Refresh:` before synthesis.

## 1.2 Create orchestration file

```markdown
# Web Research Orchestration: {topic}
Timestamp: {YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}
Started: {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS}
Thoroughness: {level}
Wave Policy: {single wave | continue while critical gaps | continue until comprehensive}

## Research Question
{Clear statement}

## Topic Decomposition
(populated in Phase 2)

## Wave Tracking
| Wave | Agents | Focus | Status | New Findings | Decision |
|------|--------|-------|--------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | {count} | Initial investigation | Pending | - | - |

## Research Assignments
(populated in Phase 2)

## Collected Findings
(populated as agents return)

## Cross-Reference Analysis
(populated after each wave)

## Gap Evaluation
(populated after each wave)

## Synthesis Notes
(populated in final phase)
```

# Phase 2: Topic Decomposition & Agent Assignment

## 2.1 Decompose into ORTHOGONAL facets

Analyze the query to identify **non-overlapping** research angles. Each agent gets a distinct domain with clear boundaries.

1. **Core question**: What is fundamentally being asked?
2. **Facets**: What distinct aspects need investigation? (technical, comparison, practical, current state, limitations)
3. **Orthogonality check**: Each facet covers a distinct domain. No two facets would naturally run the same queries. Boundaries are explicitly statable.

**Bad** (overlapping): Agent 1 = "Research Firebase", Agent 2 = "Research real-time databases"
**Good** (orthogonal): Agent 1 = "Firebase — features, pricing, limits", Agent 2 = "Non-Firebase alternatives: Supabase, Convex, PlanetScale"

**Orthogonality strategies**: by entity, by dimension, by time horizon, by perspective.

## 2.2 Plan agent assignments with explicit boundaries

| Facet | Research Focus | Explicitly EXCLUDE |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| {facet 1} | "{scope}" | "{what others cover}" |
| {facet 2} | "{scope}" | "{what others cover}" |

**If more facets than agents allow**: prioritize by (1) directly answers core question, (2) enables comparison, (3) addresses user-specified concerns. Combine related facets. Schedule remaining for Wave 2.

## 2.3 Update orchestration file with decomposition and assignments

# Phase 3: Launch Parallel Researchers

## 3.1 Launch web-researcher agents

Launch `vibe-extras:web-researcher` agents in parallel (single message with multiple invocations).

**Wave 1 prompt template** — uses neutral framing to avoid biasing agent findings:
```
Investigate the relationship between {topic} and {facet area}. Include evidence both supporting and contradicting common assumptions about {topic}.

YOUR ASSIGNED SCOPE:
- Focus areas: {specific aspect 1}, {specific aspect 2}, {specific aspect 3}
- This is YOUR domain — go deep on these topics

DO NOT RESEARCH (other agents cover these):
- {facet assigned to Agent 2}
- {facet assigned to Agent 3}

Current date context: {YYYY-MM-DD} — prioritize recent sources.

---
Research context:
- Wave: 1 (initial investigation)
- Mode: Broad exploration within your assigned scope
- Report gaps or conflicts for potential follow-up waves
```

**Wave 2+ prompt template** — targeted gap-filling with established context:
```
{Specific gap or conflict to resolve}

Context from previous waves:
- Previous findings: {summary of relevant findings}
- Gap being addressed: {specific gap}
- Established facts: {what Wave 1 found}

YOUR ASSIGNED SCOPE:
- Focus narrowly on: {targeted aspect 1}, {targeted aspect 2}
- This gap was identified because: {why previous research was insufficient}

DO NOT RESEARCH:
- Topics well-covered in Wave 1
- {areas other Wave 2 agents handle}

Current date context: {YYYY-MM-DD} — prioritize recent sources.

---
Research context:
- Wave: {N} (gap-filling)
- Mode: Targeted investigation — focus on the gap above
- Build on previous findings, don't repeat broad exploration
- Flag if gap cannot be resolved
```

**Sycophancy guard**: Agent prompts must avoid implying expected findings. Use "investigate the relationship between X and Y" not "research how X improves Y." Include "evidence both supporting and contradicting" to elicit balanced research.

**Batching**: thorough → all 2-4 agents in one batch. very-thorough → batches of 3-4 (5 agents: 3+2; 6 agents: 3+3). Wave 2+ → 1-3 focused agents.

## 3.2 Collect agent findings

Each agent returns a file path (not inline findings). After each agent completes:
1. Parse the research file path from the agent's return message
2. Read the agent's research file to extract full findings
3. Record agent status, key findings, confidence levels, and source citations in the orchestration file. Preserve all source URLs.

## 3.3 Handle agent failures

If agent times out or returns incomplete:
- **Retry** if: covers critical gap, explicitly required for comparison, or user-requested
- **Mark as gap** if: significant/minor priority, partially covered by others, or synthesis viable without
- Never block synthesis for single failed agent
- If ALL agents fail: Wave 1 → retry simpler decomposition; Wave 2+ → proceed with prior findings

# Phase 4: Cross-Reference, Evaluate & Iterate

## 4.1 Analyze findings across agents

Identify:
- **Agreements**: Multiple agents reach similar conclusions
- **Conflicts**: Findings contradict (includes "Contested" findings from agents)
- **Inconclusive**: Agents couldn't determine answers
- **Gaps**: Not covered by any agent
- **Surprises**: Unexpected findings warranting attention

**Disagreement classification** — classify conflicts before resolution:
- *Factual conflicts* (equal-authority sources): investigate deeper, favor higher authority, split if unresolvable
- *Open-question conflicts* (ongoing investigation): preserve both positions — never force false consensus
- *Authority asymmetry*: weight toward higher authority unless specific reasons to doubt

## 4.2 Update orchestration file with cross-reference analysis

Record agreements, conflicts (with classification), gaps, and key insights.

## 4.3 Key Assumptions Check (for thorough/very-thorough)

After cross-referencing, surface hidden assumptions:
1. What must be true for the emerging conclusions to hold?
2. Which assumptions are load-bearing (failure collapses most conclusions)?
3. What information would test weakened assumptions?

Common hidden assumptions: first authoritative source is reliable, topic boundaries correctly drawn, absence of contrary evidence means consensus, search results represent full landscape.

## 4.4 Linchpin analysis (for thorough/very-thorough)

Identify 3-5 claims whose failure would collapse the most conclusions. Focus any adversarial or follow-up effort on these linchpin claims first — they have the highest verification ROI.

## 4.5 Evaluate gaps and decide next wave (skip for quick/medium)

Classify each gap (critical/significant/minor). Assess wave productivity. Apply satisficing criteria.

```markdown
## Gap Evaluation (Wave {N})

### Critical Gaps
- [ ] {Gap}: {Why critical}

### Significant Gaps
- [ ] {Gap}: {Why significant}

### Minor Gaps (note, don't pursue)
- {Gap}: {Why minor}

### Wave Productivity
- Substantive findings: {count}
- Confidence improvements: {which areas}
- New areas: {list or "none"}
- Diminishing returns: {yes/no}

### Decision
**{CONTINUE to Wave N+1 | SATISFICED}** — {reason}
```

## 4.6 Launch next wave (if continuing)

1. Update Wave Tracking table
2. Design targeted prompts for specific gaps (narrower than Wave 1)
3. Launch 1-3 focused `vibe-extras:web-researcher` agents
4. Collect findings → return to 4.1

# Phase 5: Synthesize & Output

## 5.1 Refresh context (MANDATORY)

Read the FULL orchestration file AND all agent research files. Verify access to: all agent findings, cross-references, gap evaluations, wave tracking, all citations.

```
- [x] Refresh: read full orchestration file + all agent research files  ← Must complete before synthesis
- [ ] Synthesize→final output
```

## 5.2 Outside view check (for thorough/very-thorough)

Before finalizing, apply reference class reasoning: "How often does research of this type produce reliable conclusions?" Consider whether the research domain is well-covered by high-quality web sources, or if it's a niche area where available evidence may be systematically incomplete.

## 5.3 Generate output

Synthesize ALL agent findings. Use structural confidence — source agreement and evidence quality tiers, not verbal self-reports. Both overconfidence and underconfidence degrade quality.

```markdown
## Research Findings: {Topic}

**Thoroughness**: {level} | **Waves**: {count} | **Researchers**: {total} | **Sources**: {aggregate}
**Overall Confidence**: High/Medium/Low
**Satisficing**: {why research concluded}

### Executive Summary
{4-8 sentences. Key takeaway for the user.}

### Detailed Findings

#### {Finding Area 1}
{Synthesized insights with inline citations from multiple agents}
{State warrant: reasoning connecting evidence to conclusion}

#### {Finding Area 2}
{...}

### Comparison/Evaluation (if applicable)
| Option | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| {opt 1} | {evidence} | {evidence} | {synthesis} |

### Recommendations
{Evidence-based suggestions. State conditions under which they would not hold.}

### Confidence Notes
- **High confidence**: {strong multi-source agreement}
- **Medium confidence**: {some support}
- **Contested**: {high-authority sources contradicted — both positions presented}
- **Inconclusive**: {couldn't determine despite searching}
- **Low confidence**: {single source or weak agreement}

### Key Assumptions
{Load-bearing assumptions that must hold for conclusions to be valid}

### Research Progression (multi-wave)
| Wave | Focus | Agents | Key Contribution |
|------|-------|--------|------------------|
| 1 | Initial investigation | {N} | {established} |
| 2 | {Gap focus} | {N} | {resolved} |

### Gaps & Limitations
- {Unanswered questions}
- {Areas needing more research}
- {Source biases}
- {Minor gaps not pursued}
- {Protocol deviations from initial plan}

### Source Summary
| Source | Authority | Confidence | Date | Used For | Wave |
|--------|-----------|------------|------|----------|------|
| {url} | High/Med | {GRADE-adjusted} | {date} | {finding} | 1 |

---
Orchestration file: {path}
Research completed: {timestamp}
```

## Quick Mode Flow

For quick (single-fact) queries:
1. State: `**Thoroughness**: quick — [reason]`
2. Launch single `vibe-extras:web-researcher` agent with the query
3. Read the agent's research file from the returned path
4. Present findings directly to user (no synthesis overhead)

# Principles

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Thoroughness first | Determine level before any research |
| Facet-driven scaling | Match agent count to genuine orthogonal facets, not thoroughness level alone |
| Write after each phase | Update orchestration file after EVERY phase/agent |
| Parallel execution | Launch agents simultaneously when possible |
| Neutral framing | Agent prompts avoid implying expected findings |
| Cross-reference | Compare findings across agents; classify disagreements before resolving |
| Gap evaluation | Classify gaps (critical/significant/minor) after each wave |
| Key Assumptions Check | Surface hidden assumptions after cross-referencing |
| Linchpin focus | Target verification at claims whose failure collapses most conclusions |
| Outside view (thorough+) | Apply reference class reasoning before finalizing |
| Wave iteration | Continue until satisficed OR diminishing returns |
| **Context refresh** | **Read full orchestration file BEFORE synthesis — non-negotiable** |
| Source preservation | Maintain citations through synthesis |
| Structural confidence | Assess via source agreement and evidence tiers, not verbal reports |
| Gap honesty | State what couldn't be answered despite effort |

## Never Do

- Launch agents without determining thoroughness
- Skip write-to-log todos or orchestration file updates
- Synthesize without refreshing from orchestration file
- Present findings without source citations
- Ignore conflicts between agents (especially "Contested" findings)
- Frame agent prompts to imply expected findings
- Skip gap evaluation for thorough/very-thorough
- Continue waves when diminishing returns detected
- Stop when critical/significant gaps remain and waves are still productive
- Over-spawn agents beyond genuine facet count
