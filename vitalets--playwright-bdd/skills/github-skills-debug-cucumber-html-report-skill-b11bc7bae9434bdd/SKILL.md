# Debug Cucumber HTML Report

## When to Use
- Inspecting the Cucumber HTML report DOM structure after a reporter version upgrade
- Updating test selectors in `check-report`
- Verifying how steps, hooks, attachments, screenshots, traces appear in the report

## Opening the Report

Always use **`playwright-cli`** with the `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_ALLOW_UNRESTRICTED_FILE_ACCESS` environment variable to open local report files. Do NOT use Playwright MCP (`@playwright/mcp`).

Run `playwright-cli --help` to see the full list of available commands (open, snapshot, eval, click, goto, etc.).
