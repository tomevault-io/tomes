# Jujutsu (jj) Version Control

Use `jj` instead of `git` for all version control operations.

Run `jj --help` for the authoritative command reference and
`jj <command> --help` for current flags and options. Never rely on this
skill as authoritative — verify behavior with `--help`.

## Making Commits

**No staging area** — files are automatically tracked. Edit files and commit.

```bash
# Describe current change
jj describe -m "Add feature X"

# Finalize current change and start a new empty one
jj commit -m "Add feature X"

# Start new change on top of current
jj new -m "Next task"

# Start new change on main
jj new main -m "Start feature"
```

## Key Differences from Git

- `@` = working copy (current change)
- `@-` = parent of working copy
- Changes auto-amend — editing files updates the current change
- `jj squash` moves changes into parent (like `git commit --amend`)
- `jj squash -i` for interactive selection

## Showing Diffs

`jj show` does not accept path arguments. Use `jj diff` instead:

```bash
jj diff -r @-                                     # all changes in parent
jj diff -r @- path/to/file                        # specific file
jj diff -- 'glob:"bin/*" ~ glob:"bin/,special"'   # fileset expression
```

## Advancing Bookmarks

After `jj commit`, advance the nearest ancestor bookmark forward:

```bash
jj bookmark advance                  # advance closest bookmark(s) to @
```

Run `jj bookmark advance --help` for `--to` and other options.

## Quick Reference

| Task                  | Command                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Set commit message    | `jj describe -m "message"` |
| Finalize and continue | `jj commit -m "message"`   |
| Start new change      | `jj new` or `jj new main`  |
| Amend into parent     | `jj squash`                |
| View status           | `jj st`                    |
| View log              | `jj log`                   |
| View diff             | `jj diff -r <rev>`         |
| Advance bookmark      | `jj bookmark advance`      |
| Push to remote        | `jj git push --change @`   |
| Undo last operation   | `jj undo`                  |
