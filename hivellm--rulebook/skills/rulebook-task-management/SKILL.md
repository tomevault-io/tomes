# Rulebook Task Management

## When to Create Tasks

**Create tasks for:**
- New features/capabilities
- Breaking changes
- Architecture changes
- Performance/security work

**Skip for:**
- Bug fixes
- Typos, formatting, comments
- Dependency updates (non-breaking)

## Task Commands

```bash
rulebook task create <task-id>    # Create new task
rulebook task list                # List all tasks
rulebook task show <task-id>      # Show task details
rulebook task validate <task-id>  # Validate structure
rulebook task archive <task-id>   # Archive completed task
```

## Mandatory Workflow

**NEVER start implementation without creating a task first:**

1. **STOP** - Do not start coding
2. **Create task** - `rulebook task create <task-id>`
3. **Plan** - Write proposal.md and tasks.md
4. **Spec** - Write spec deltas
5. **Validate** - `rulebook task validate <task-id>`
6. **THEN** - Start implementation

## Task Directory Structure

```
rulebook/tasks/<task-id>/
├── proposal.md         # Why and what changes
├── tasks.md            # Implementation checklist
├── design.md           # Technical design (optional)
└── specs/
    └── <module>/
        └── spec.md     # Technical specifications
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always create task first** - Document before implementing
2. **Keep tasks.md simple** - Only checklist items
3. **Put details in specs** - Technical requirements in spec files
4. **Validate before implementing** - Run `rulebook task validate`
5. **Archive when done** - Move completed tasks to archive
