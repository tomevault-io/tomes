## Usage

1. This SKILL.md file is loaded automatically when the skill is invoked
2. Use `Skill(skill="test-skill-multifile", file="helper.py")` to load the Python script
3. Use `Skill(skill="test-skill-multifile", file="references/guide.md")` to load the reference guide
4. Execute scripts using Bash tool with the base path provided in context

## Example Workflow
