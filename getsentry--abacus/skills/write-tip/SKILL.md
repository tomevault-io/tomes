# Write Tip Skill

Create high-quality AI productivity tips and guides for the Abacus dashboard.

## Before Writing

Read these files to understand the existing format:
- `src/lib/tips.ts` - All existing tips and guides (study the structure)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project guidelines including tip writing rules

## Tip Structure

Each tip has two parts:

### 1. TipBar Entry (in TIPS array)

```typescript
{
  id: 'unique-kebab-id',
  text: 'Concise tip shown in the banner (one sentence)',
  guide: 'guide-slug',  // Links to the guide below
}
```

### 2. Guide Entry (in GUIDES object)

```typescript
'guide-slug': {
  slug: 'guide-slug',
  title: 'Short Title',
  description: 'One-line description',
  externalDocs: 'https://...',  // Optional official docs link
  tools: ['claude-code', 'cursor'],  // Which tools it applies to
  content: `
## What is [Feature]?

One to two sentences explaining what this is. No fluff.

## Try It: [Scenario Name]

**Scenario**: Brief context (one sentence).

**Step 1**: Do this
\`\`\`
Exact prompt text the user types
\`\`\`

**Step 2**: Then this
\`\`\`
Another prompt
\`\`\`

## Key Points

- **Point one** - brief explanation
- **Point two** - brief explanation
- **Point three** - brief explanation
  `,
}
```

## Writing Rules

1. **Prompts are primary** - Show exact text users type, not abstract descriptions
2. **Scenarios > theory** - "Here's how to do X" beats "X is useful because..."
3. **Concise** - Users skim; keep sections short
4. **No fluff** - Skip "In this guide you'll learn..." intros
5. **No `>` prefix** - Don't prefix prompt examples with `>` (causes rendering issues)
6. **Separate code blocks** - Don't mix bash commands with prompts in the same block

## Code Block Formatting

Use plain code blocks for prompts (no language specifier):
```
This is a prompt the user types
```

Use `bash` for shell commands:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-thing
```

Use `markdown` for file content examples:
```markdown
---
name: my-skill
---
```

## Tools Field

- `'claude-code'` - Claude Code CLI features
- `'cursor'` - Cursor editor features
- Use both if the tip applies to both tools

## Quality Checklist

Before finishing, verify:

- [ ] Has a concrete "Try It" scenario with copy-pasteable prompts
- [ ] No `>` prefix on prompt lines
- [ ] Code blocks have correct language tags (or none for prompts)
- [ ] Description is one line, not a paragraph
- [ ] Tools array is accurate
- [ ] Slug matches the guide key
- [ ] At least 2-3 related TipBar entries point to this guide

## Adding Icons

If creating a new guide, add its icon mapping in:
- `src/app/tips/page.tsx` - GUIDE_ICONS object
- `src/app/tips/[slug]/page.tsx` - GUIDE_ICONS object

Available icons from lucide-react: Compass, RefreshCw, Command, MapPin, Cpu, MessageSquare, GitBranch, Users, FileCode, Zap, Star, etc.
