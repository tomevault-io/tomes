# Message Drafts

Create rich text messages that paste perfectly into Gmail, Outlook, or convert to WhatsApp-formatted text. Fragments are written in Markdown - the build script converts to platform-specific HTML automatically.

## Architecture

```
Claude writes              Build script assembles          Output (separate file)
name.fragment.md  --->     Markdown -> HTML                name.html
(10-30 lines)              Gmail transform (tags)          (self-contained preview
                           Outlook transform (styles)       with three body versions)
                           Inject into shell.html
```

The fragment is the source of truth. The assembled HTML is a derived output. Never edit the `.html` output directly.

## Create Workflow

1. Draft email content in conversation
2. Write a `.fragment.md` file to `data/writing/email_drafts/`
3. Run the assembler with `--serve` to produce the preview HTML and launch the server

```bash
uv run .claude/skills/message/scripts/assemble.py /path/to/name.fragment.md --serve
```

Run with `run_in_background: true`. The server picks a random free port and prints the URL. The preview auto-refreshes when the HTML file changes - no manual browser refresh needed.

## Edit Workflow

When editing an existing email (argument provided, or user asks to change something):

1. Read the small `.fragment.md` file
2. Use the Edit tool to make targeted changes
3. Re-run the assembler **without** `--serve` to rebuild the preview

```bash
uv run .claude/skills/message/scripts/assemble.py /path/to/name.fragment.md
```

The preview server is still running in the background from the create step. The assembler overwrites the HTML file atomically, and the browser auto-refreshes within 2 seconds. Do **not** re-launch the server on edits - the user keeps the same URL.

## Fragment Format

Fragments are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
to: recipient@example.com
cc: optional@example.com
subject: Email Subject
---

Hi **Stuart**,

Here's the ~~old approach~~ new approach.

## Key Points

- First item
- Second item

> Quoted text from previous email

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Auth    | Done   |

Inline `code` and [a link](https://example.com).

Cheers,
Henrik
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `to` | Yes | Comma-separated recipients |
| `subject` | Yes | Email subject line |
| `cc` | No | Hidden in preview if empty |
| `bcc` | No | Hidden in preview if empty |

### Formatting Reference

Standard Markdown maps to platform-specific HTML automatically:

| What you want | Write in Markdown |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Bold | `**bold**` |
| Italic | `*italic*` |
| Strikethrough | `~~strikethrough~~` |
| Heading | `## Heading` |
| Bullet list | `- item` |
| Numbered list | `1. item` |
| Blockquote | `> quoted text` |
| Inline code | `` `code` `` |
| Code block | triple backticks |
| Link | `[text](url)` |
| Table | `| col | col |` with separator row |

For features not in standard Markdown, embed HTML directly (it passes through unchanged):

| What you want | Embed as HTML |
|---------------|---------------|
| Custom colour | `<span style="color: #c0392b;">red text</span>` |
| Large text | `<font size="4">larger text</font>` |
| Underline | `<u>underlined</u>` |
| Indent | `<blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">indented</blockquote>` |

### Example: User Asks for Colour and Strikethrough

```
User: "Write an email to Stuart. Strikethrough '$5000' and make his name red."

Claude writes .fragment.md:

---
to: akumanostuart@gmail.com
subject: Pricing Update
---

Hi <span style="color: #c0392b;">Stuart</span>,

The old pricing was ~~$5000~~ but the new rate is $3000.

Cheers,
Henrik
```

## File Naming

```
data/writing/email_drafts/YYYY-MM-DD_recipient_subject.fragment.md   <- source
data/writing/email_drafts/YYYY-MM-DD_recipient_subject.html          <- assembled output
```

Examples:

- `2026-02-12_veronika_audit-proposal.fragment.md`
- `2026-02-12_danielle_project-update.fragment.md`

## Platform Transforms

The build script produces three HTML versions from a single Markdown source:

**Gmail** (tag transform): Converts semantic HTML to Gmail-native elements. `<p>` becomes `<div>`, `<strong>` becomes `<b>`, `<em>` becomes `<i>`, headings become `<font size>` with `<b>`. Container gets Arial 13px. No custom colours added - only platform defaults.

**Outlook** (style injection): Adds inline styles to every element for Word's rendering engine. Aptos/Calibri 11pt, explicit `color: #000000` on every text element, `mso-line-height-rule` for spacing control. No custom colours added - only platform defaults.

**WhatsApp** (text conversion): Strips HTML and converts to WhatsApp markdown - `*bold*`, `_italic_`, `~strikethrough~`. Tables become pipe-separated text.

User-specified inline styles (colours, font sizes) are preserved through all transforms.

## Preview

The assembled HTML has a **Gmail/Outlook/WhatsApp mode toggle**:

- **Gmail mode**: Gmail-native HTML with Arial 13px container, Gmail action buttons (Compose in Gmail, Open Gmail Inbox, Copy for Gmail)
- **Outlook mode**: Outlook-native HTML with full inline styles, Outlook action button (Copy for Outlook)
- **WhatsApp mode**: Converts to WhatsApp-compatible plain text. Action buttons: Copy for WhatsApp, Send via WhatsApp

Instruct user:

1. Click the URL printed by the server
2. Select Gmail, Outlook, or WhatsApp mode
3. Review the email preview
4. Use the action buttons for their chosen client

## Backward Compatibility

Legacy `.fragment.html` files still work. The assembler detects the extension and uses the appropriate parser. For HTML fragments, the same body is used for all three platform views (matching previous behaviour).

## Structure

Follow this order in every email:

1. **Lead with the point** - the request, update, instruction, or information the recipient needs to act on. This is why they opened the email.
2. **Supporting detail** - context, logistics, or reference material that supports the lead.
3. **Warm close** - any personal, relational, or appreciative content goes at the end, just before the sign-off. Gratitude, compliments, looking-forward sentiments, and rapport-building belong here - never at the top.

The recipient should know what the email is about within the first two lines. Warmth is the exit feeling, not the entrance.

## Tone

- Write naturally, as a human would compose
- Avoid repetitive language from previous emails in the thread
- Keep prose flowing, not overly structured
- Match the recipient's formality level
- Use British English spelling (colour, analyse, organise, behaviour, centre)

## Henrik's Default Details

Use these when composing emails on Henrik's behalf:

| Purpose | Email |
|---------|-------|
| Primary / From address | admin@henriksoderlund.com |
| Google platform access requests (GA4, GTM, Google Ads, Search Console, etc.) | admin@henriksoderlund.com |

Sign-off block:

```
Henrik Soederlund
Independent Digital Consultant
admin@henriksoderlund.com
```

## References

- `references/outlook-formatting.md` - Outlook element styles and colour palette reference
- `references/formatting-rules.md` - Gmail native HTML element reference

## After Preview

Once the user has the preview URL, ask whether they'd like to run the **humaniser** skill on the message to remove any AI writing patterns before sending. Example prompt: "Would you like me to run the humaniser skill on this draft to make it sound more natural?"

## Post-Draft Actions

After saving a draft, prompt Henrik: "Log this to the client comms log?" If yes, write the entry to `data/consulting/clients/[slug]/comms/_comms-log.json` via inline Python or the Edit tool (`manage_comms.py` is read-only - no --add flag).
