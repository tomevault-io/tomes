description: Query, audit, and optimize Google Ads campaigns. Supports two modes: (1) API mode for bulk operations with the google-ads Python SDK, (2) attached-browser mode for users without API access. Use when asked to check ad performance, pause campaigns or keywords, find wasted spend, audit conversion tracking, or optimize Google Ads accounts. Use when this capability is needed.

# Google Ads Skill

Manage Google Ads accounts via API or an attached browser session.

## Mode Selection

**Check which mode to use:**

1. **API Mode** - If user has `google-ads.yaml` configured or `GOOGLE_ADS_*` env vars
2. **Browser Mode** - If user says "I don't have API access" or just wants quick checks

```bash
# Check for API config
ls ~/.google-ads.yaml 2>/dev/null || ls google-ads.yaml 2>/dev/null
```

If no config found, ask: "Do you have Google Ads API credentials, or should I use the attached browser session?"

---

## Browser Mode (Universal)

**Requirements:** User logged into ads.google.com in browser

### Setup
1. User opens ads.google.com and logs in
2. User clicks Clawdbot Browser Relay toolbar icon (badge ON)
3. Use `browser` tool with `profile="chrome"`

### Common Workflows

#### Get Campaign Performance
```
1. Navigate to: ads.google.com/aw/campaigns
2. Set date range (top right date picker)
3. Snapshot the campaigns table
4. Parse: Campaign, Status, Budget, Cost, Conversions, Cost/Conv
```

#### Find Zero-Conversion Keywords (Wasted Spend)
```
1. Navigate to: ads.google.com/aw/keywords
2. Click "Add filter" → Conversions → Less than → 1
3. Click "Add filter" → Cost → Greater than → [threshold, e.g., $500]
4. Sort by Cost descending
5. Snapshot table for analysis
```

#### Pause Keywords/Campaigns
```
1. Navigate to keywords or campaigns view
2. Check boxes for items to pause
3. Click "Edit" dropdown → "Pause"
4. Confirm action
```

#### Download Reports
```
1. Navigate to desired view (campaigns, keywords, etc.)
2. Click "Download" icon (top right of table)
3. Select format (CSV recommended)
4. File downloads to user's Downloads folder
```

**For detailed browser selectors:** Load `browser-workflows.md` from this skill's `references` folder.

## API Mode (Power Users)

**Requirements:** Google Ads API developer token plus locally configured client credentials

### Setup Check
```bash
# Verify google-ads SDK
python -c "from google.ads.googleads.client import GoogleAdsClient; print('OK')"

# Check config
cat ~/.google-ads.yaml
```

### Common Operations

#### Query Campaign Performance
```python
from google.ads.googleads.client import GoogleAdsClient

client = GoogleAdsClient.load_from_storage()
ga_service = client.get_service("GoogleAdsService")

query = """
    SELECT campaign.name, campaign.status,
           metrics.cost_micros, metrics.conversions,
           metrics.cost_per_conversion
    FROM campaign
    WHERE segments.date DURING LAST_30_DAYS
    ORDER BY metrics.cost_micros DESC
"""

response = ga_service.search(customer_id=CUSTOMER_ID, query=query)
```

#### Find Zero-Conversion Keywords
```python
query = """
    SELECT ad_group_criterion.keyword.text,
           campaign.name, metrics.cost_micros
    FROM keyword_view
    WHERE metrics.conversions = 0
      AND metrics.cost_micros > 500000000
      AND segments.date DURING LAST_90_DAYS
    ORDER BY metrics.cost_micros DESC
"""
```

#### Pause Keywords
```python
operations = []
for keyword_id in keywords_to_pause:
    operation = client.get_type("AdGroupCriterionOperation")
    operation.update.resource_name = f"customers/{customer_id}/adGroupCriteria/{ad_group_id}~{keyword_id}"
    operation.update.status = client.enums.AdGroupCriterionStatusEnum.PAUSED
    operations.append(operation)

service.mutate_ad_group_criteria(customer_id=customer_id, operations=operations)
```

**For full API reference:** Load `api-setup.md` from this skill's `references` folder.

## Audit Checklist

Quick health check for any Google Ads account:

| Check | Browser Path | What to Look For |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| Zero-conv keywords | Keywords → Filter: Conv<1, Cost>$500 | Wasted spend |
| Empty ad groups | Ad Groups → Filter: Ads=0 | No creative running |
| Policy violations | Campaigns → Status column | Yellow warning icons |
| Optimization Score | Overview page (top right) | Below 70% = action needed |
| Conversion tracking | Tools → Conversions | Inactive/no recent data |

---

## Output Formats

When reporting findings, use tables:

```markdown
## Campaign Performance (Last 30 Days)
| Campaign | Cost | Conv | CPA | Status |
|----------|------|------|-----|--------|
| Branded  | $5K  | 50   | $100| ✅ Good |
| SDK Web  | $10K | 2    | $5K | ❌ Pause |

## Recommended Actions
1. **PAUSE**: SDK Web campaign ($5K CPA)
2. **INCREASE**: Branded budget (strong performer)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

## Safety Boundaries

- Do not pause campaigns, keywords, or budgets without explicit confirmation from the user.
- Do not export or summarize account data beyond the account, date range, and entities the user requested.
- Do not expose API credentials, downloaded reports, or account identifiers in chat output.
- Do not use browser mode unless the user has attached the correct logged-in ads.google.com session.

### Browser Mode Issues
- **Can't see data**: Check user is on correct account (top right account selector)
- **Slow loading**: Google Ads UI is heavy; wait for tables to fully load
- **Session expired**: User needs to re-login to ads.google.com

### API Mode Issues
- **Authentication failed**: Refresh OAuth token, check `google-ads.yaml`
- **Developer token rejected**: Ensure token is approved (not test mode)
- **Customer ID error**: Use 10-digit ID without dashes

## Security & Change-Control Addendum

- Default mode is read-only audit/reporting.
- Any mutating action (pause/enable/edit bids/budgets) requires explicit confirmation listing impacted entities first.
- Browser mode must be user-attended for account-affecting actions.
- Protect `~/.google-ads.yaml` permissions and never echo tokens/secrets in terminal output.
