# Nudocs

Upload documents to Nudocs.ai for rich editing, get shareable links, and pull back the results.

## Setup

1. Install the CLI using the repo's declared install metadata or your preferred package manager before first use.

2. Get your API key from https://nudocs.ai (click "Integration" after signing in)

3. Configure the key:
```bash
# Option 1: Environment variable
export NUDOCS_API_KEY="nudocs_your_key_here"

# Option 2: Config file
mkdir -p ~/.config/nudocs
echo "nudocs_your_key_here" > ~/.config/nudocs/api_key
```

## Commands

```bash
nudocs upload <file>              # Upload and get edit link
nudocs list                       # List all documents
nudocs link [ulid]                # Get edit link (last upload if no ULID)
nudocs pull [ulid] [--format fmt] # Download document (default: docx)
nudocs delete <ulid>              # Delete a document
nudocs config                     # Show configuration
```

## Workflow

### Upload Flow
1. Create/write document content
2. Save as markdown (or other supported format)
3. Run: `nudocs upload <file>`
4. Share the returned edit link with user

### Pull Flow
1. User requests document back
2. Run: `nudocs pull [ulid] --format <fmt>`
3. Read and present the downloaded file

### Format Selection

| Scenario | Recommended Format |
|----------|-------------------|
| User edited with rich formatting | `docx` (default) |
| Simple text/code content | `md` |
| Final delivery/sharing | `pdf` |

See `formats.md` in this skill's `references` folder for full format support.

## Natural Language Triggers

Recognize these user intents:

**Upload/Send:**
- "send to nudocs"
- "upload to nudocs"  
- "open in nudocs"
- "edit this in nudocs"
- "let me edit this in nudocs"
- "put this in nudocs"

**Pull/Fetch:**
- "pull it back"
- "pull from nudocs"
- "get that doc"
- "fetch from nudocs"
- "download from nudocs"
- "grab the updated version"
- "what did I change"
- "get my edits"

**Link:**
- "get the nudocs link"
- "share link"
- "where's that doc"
- "nudocs url"

**List:**
- "show my nudocs"
- "list my documents"
- "what docs do I have"
- "my nudocs documents"

## Document Best Practices

Before uploading, ensure good structure:
- Clear heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Consistent spacing
- Appropriate list formatting
- Concise paragraphs (3-5 sentences)

See `document-design.md` in this skill's `references` folder for templates and guidelines.

## Example Session

```
User: Write me a blog post about remote work and send it to Nudocs

Agent:
1. Writes blog-remote-work.md with proper structure
2. Runs: nudocs upload blog-remote-work.md
3. Returns: "Here's your Nudocs link: https://nudocs.ai/file/01ABC..."

User: *edits in Nudocs, adds formatting, images*
User: Pull that back

Agent:
1. Runs: nudocs pull --format docx
2. Reads the downloaded file
3. Returns: "Got your updated document! Here's what changed..."
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "No API key found" | Missing credentials | Set NUDOCS_API_KEY or create config file |
| "DOCUMENT_LIMIT_REACHED" | Free tier limit (10 docs) | Delete old docs or upgrade to Pro |
| "Unauthorized" | Invalid API key | Regenerate key in Nudocs settings |
| "No ULID provided" | Missing document ID | Specify ULID or upload a doc first |

## Safety Boundaries

- Do not upload sensitive documents unless the user confirmed that third-party processing is acceptable.
- Do not print API keys, edit links meant to stay private, or document contents the user did not ask to expose.
- Do not delete documents from Nudocs without explicit confirmation.
- Do not assume the default download format is correct; confirm the output format when it matters.
