# uni-app-tailwindcss-template

> This repository is a `pnpm` workspace containing the publishable create CLI and its registered uni-app templates. The default `uni-app + Vite + Vue 3 + Tailwind CSS` application lives in `packages/template/`; put its routes under `packages/template/src/pages/`, shared UI under `packages/template/src/components/`, Pinia stores under `packages/template/src/stores/`, and static files under `packages/template/src/static/`. The initializer lives in `packages/create-uni-app-tailwindcss/`, while `templates.json` is the shared source of truth for CLI bundling, root scripts, and CI matrices. Template tooling is defined in [`packages/template/vite.config.ts`](packages/template/vite.config.ts) and [`packages/template/eslint.config.mjs`](packages/template/eslint.config.mjs), with Tailwind v4 configuration in [`packages/template/src/tailwind.css`](packages/template/src/tailwind.css).

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This repository is a `pnpm` workspace containing the publishable create CLI and its registered uni-app templates. The default `uni-app + Vite + Vue 3 + Tailwind CSS` application lives in `packages/template/`; put its routes under `packages/template/src/pages/`, shared UI under `packages/template/src/components/`, Pinia stores under `packages/template/src/stores/`, and static files under `packages/template/src/static/`. The initializer lives in `packages/create-uni-app-tailwindcss/`, while `templates.json` is the shared source of truth for CLI bundling, root scripts, and CI matrices. Template tooling is defined in [`packages/template/vite.config.ts`](packages/template/vite.config.ts) and [`packages/template/eslint.config.mjs`](packages/template/eslint.config.mjs), with Tailwind v4 configuration in [`packages/template/src/tailwind.css`](packages/template/src/tailwind.css).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use `pnpm install` to install dependencies. `weapp-tailwindcss@5` handles Tailwind generation at build time, so no install-time Tailwind hook is required.

- `pnpm dev:mp-weixin`: start WeChat Mini Program development build.
- `pnpm dev:h5`: run the H5 dev server.
- `pnpm build:mp-weixin`: create a production Mini Program build in `dist/build/mp-weixin`.
- `pnpm build:h5`: create an H5 production build.
- `pnpm create:build`: build the initializer and bundle every registered template.
- `pnpm test:e2e`: verify scaffolding and the generated H5 application with Playwright.
- `pnpm test:e2e:daily`: run the full candidate and npm-latest user lifecycle; use `-- --source candidate|latest|all` to select sources.
- `pnpm test:e2e:daily:unit`: verify source parsing, fingerprint comparison, coverage, and status aggregation.
- `pnpm test:daily:runtime`: create candidate/latest projects and run their H5, WeChat, iOS, Android, and scheduled GitHub lanes; reports use exit codes 0/1/2 for pass/fail/blocked.
- `pnpm test:hmr:artifact:<target>`: run the headless App or Mini Program artifact HMR check used by CI; supported targets are `app`, `mp-weixin`, `mp-alipay`, and `mp-toutiao`.
- `pnpm test:hmr:h5`: verify H5 HMR in a real browser and write evidence under `packages/template/.hmr-artifacts/`.
- `pnpm test:hmr:mp-weixin`: verify HMR against a logged-in WeChat DevTools runtime.
- `pnpm test:app-css:artifact`: verify App CSS compatibility from an existing `build:app` output without rebuilding it.
- `pnpm template @default open:dev`: open WeChat DevTools for the default template.
- `pnpm lint`: run the default template's ESLint checks.
- `pnpm lint:fix`: auto-fix lint issues in the default template.
- `pnpm update:deps`: interactively update regular template dependencies while excluding the uni-app compatibility set.
- `pnpm update:uni-app`: update the DCloud-managed uni-app compiler dependencies together through UVM.
- `pnpm release`: record a pnpm native change intent for a publishable package.
- `pnpm release:status`: preview pending package versions without modifying files.
- `pnpm repo:doctor`: validate the repoctl and release configuration.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Follow `.editorconfig`: 2-space indentation, LF line endings, UTF-8. Prefer Vue 3 SFCs with TypeScript. Use PascalCase for component filenames such as `HeroShowcase.vue`, camelCase for store and utility modules such as `counter.ts`, and keep page directories route-aligned, for example `packages/template/src/pages/index/index.vue`. ESLint uses `@icebreakers/eslint-config` with Vue, Tailwind, and WeChat rules; run `pnpm lint` before opening a PR.

## Testing Guidelines

Playwright tests live in `packages/create-uni-app-tailwindcss/tests/` and cover project scaffolding plus the generated H5 page. Treat `pnpm lint`, `pnpm create:build`, and `pnpm test:e2e` as the minimum create-package quality gate. Template runtime changes should also run the affected target build and, for WeChat behavior, `pnpm dev:mp-weixin` plus WeChat DevTools. Keep new TypeScript tests under the owning package with `*.spec.ts` naming.

### HMR Verification Notes

Use the matching `pnpm test:hmr:artifact:<target>` script for the deterministic headless CI path. It applies the shared probe fixture atomically, verifies transformed template/script/style artifacts before and after an incremental compile, and restores the source even after interruption.

Runtime verification remains platform-specific: `pnpm test:hmr:h5` uses local Chrome or the Playwright Chromium fallback, `pnpm test:hmr:mp-weixin` requires logged-in WeChat DevTools, and the App scripts require the matching HBuilderX CLI plus a running device or simulator. Quality CI runs hosted H5 runtime HMR and artifact HMR for App, WeChat, Alipay, and Toutiao. External WeChat DevTools, HBuilderX, iOS Simulator, and Android device runtimes remain local-only checks. Reports, screenshots, and logs live under ignored `packages/template/.hmr-artifacts/`; do not commit them or bundle them into generated projects.
For WeChat DevTools automation, use `weapp-ide-cli` exclusively. Do not add new uses of `@dcloudio/uni-automator`, and do not use its launcher for new runtime, screenshot, navigation, or HMR checks. Existing references should be migrated to the corresponding `weapp-ide-cli` command or API when that test path is changed.


The daily lifecycle contract defines 100% as every required scenario being executed. `BLOCKED` counts as executed but cannot pass the suite; `MISSING` and `SKIP` fail it. Scheduled/manual CI runs candidate/latest on Node 22 and 24, compares generated-project fingerprints, and treats npm latest drift as a failure.

The daily local runner starts at 03:10 Asia/Shanghai after the 03:00 GitHub `Quality` schedule. It creates isolated candidate/latest projects and runs their runtime lanes serially. It may boot the selected iOS Simulator and open HBuilderX, but must only stop applications or simulators it started. Use `DAILY_IOS_DEVICE_ID` to pin iOS; Android requires exactly one already-online device, and WeChat login remains a manual prerequisite. Treat missing external runtime state as `BLOCKED`, not a test assertion failure.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent history uses short Conventional Commit style prefixes such as `chore:` and `chore(deps):`. Keep that pattern for new work, for example `feat: add profile page` or `fix: correct tailwind class merge`. User-visible changes to `create-uni-app-tailwindcss` or its bundled templates require a Chinese pnpm change summary committed with the change. PRs should include a concise description, linked issue when applicable, screenshots or DevTools captures for UI changes, and the commands used for verification.

## Configuration Tips

Before shipping a generated app, replace the `appid` in `packages/template/src/manifest.json` with the target project's value. Keep generated output under `dist/` out of source edits, and prefer updating template or CLI source files rather than bundled artifacts. Publishing is orchestrated by repoctl through `.github/workflows/release.yml`; do not add a second release workflow or commit npm credentials.

Project-level agent skills should stay minimal in this repository. Keep installed skills under `.agents/skills/` and commit `skills-lock.json` for reproducibility. Do not commit compatibility symlink directories such as `.claude/`, `.continue/`, or `skills/` unless this repository explicitly needs those tools.
