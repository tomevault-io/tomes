# SRE Agent Administration

For **this demo**, agent configuration is declared in Bicep
(`infra/modules/sre-agent.bicep`). The following all flow through
`Microsoft.App/agents/*` ARM resources:

- **Agent settings** — autonomous mode, High access level, Azure Monitor incident binding
- **Connectors** — `app-insights`, `log-analytics`, `azure-monitor` (MonitorClient), `microsoft-learn` (MCP)
- **Custom skills** — `database-incidents`, `performance-incidents`, `application-incidents`, `general-triage` (the unknown bucket), `proactive-health-check` (auto-selected by description; max 5 concurrent)
- **Response plans / incident filters** — `zava-database`, `zava-performance`, `zava-application` (known-good, autonomous) + `zava-unknown` (catch-all, Review mode)
  (routed by `titleContains` / `titleNotContains`)
- **RBAC** — system-assigned managed identity granted Reader, Monitoring Reader,
  Contributor, and AKS RBAC Cluster Admin on the resource group

To change any of these, **edit the Bicep and run `azd provision`**. There is no
data-plane CLI tool for them in this repo.

## Knowledge base (the one data-plane piece)

ARM does not yet surface SRE Agent knowledge files, so they're uploaded by
`scripts/setup-sre-agent.ps1`:

```powershell
.\scripts\setup-sre-agent.ps1
```

The script reads every `*.md` under `sre-config/knowledge-base/`, substitutes
`@@RG@@` -> the actual resource group, computes a SHA256, and uploads only files
whose content has changed since the last run (cache in
`sre-config/knowledge-base/.upload-hashes.json`). To add new agent knowledge:

1. Drop a new `*.md` file into `sre-config/knowledge-base/`
2. Use `@@RG@@` placeholder anywhere you need the resource group name
3. Re-run `.\scripts\setup-sre-agent.ps1`

To remove a knowledge file: delete the local `.md`, then delete the corresponding
`<name>.md` from the agent's Builder UI > Knowledge sources view (the
script does not delete remote files that are no longer present locally).

## When helping users

1. **"Add a skill / response plan / connector"** — edit `infra/modules/sre-agent.bicep`
   and run `azd provision`. Show the user the relevant resource block as a template.
2. **"Add a knowledge file"** — drop the markdown under `sre-config/knowledge-base/`
   and run `setup-sre-agent.ps1`.
3. **"Verify the agent is configured"** — run `setup-sre-agent.ps1`; its Step 3
   output reports `[OK]` or `[MISSING]` for every Bicep-deployed asset.
4. **Activity-log alerts gotcha** — they fire as Sev4 regardless of the configured
   severity, so response plan filters must match all severities (Bicep already does).
5. **Runbook philosophy** — the five skills (`database-incidents`, `performance-incidents`,
   `application-incidents`, `general-triage`, `proactive-health-check`) in `sre-agent.bicep`
   state the facts the agent can't infer (the RBAC it holds, what each alert means, which
   table to look at) — e.g. the `database-incidents` runbook's `postgres-unreachable` triage
   table maps alert → ARM-state check → action TYPE — while keeping the actual remediation at
   the action-type level, NOT copy-paste SQL/kubectl recipes. Preserve both halves when
   adding/modifying skills. See AGENTS.md "Non-Obvious Things" for the full rationale.
