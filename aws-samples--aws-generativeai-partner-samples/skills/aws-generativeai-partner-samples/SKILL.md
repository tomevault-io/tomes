# Sales Ops: Cortex Agent + MCP + Amazon Quick

Builds a complete Sales Operations analytics pipeline: Semantic View, Cortex Agent, MCP Server, and OAuth integration for Amazon Quick MCP Connector.

## When to Use

Use this skill when someone asks:
- "Build a sales ops agent with MCP and Amazon Quick"
- "Create a Cortex Agent for sales operations data"
- "Set up a sales analytics demo with QuickSight integration"
- "Expose a sales agent to Amazon QuickSight via MCP"

## Prerequisites

- Snowflake account with ACCOUNTADMIN access
- 6 sales ops tables loaded in a schema (transactions, customers, products, reps, pipeline, marketing)
- A warehouse for query execution
- Amazon QuickSight Author subscription or higher

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Information

**Ask user for the following:**

```
To build your Sales Ops agent and QuickSight integration, provide:

1. DATABASE   : Database containing your sales ops tables
2. SCHEMA     : Schema containing your sales ops tables
3. WAREHOUSE  : Warehouse for query execution
4. ACCOUNT    : Snowflake account identifier (e.g., abc12345)
5. ROLE       : Snowflake role
```

If user doesn't know their account identifier, suggest:
```sql
SELECT CURRENT_ACCOUNT();
```

Verify the 6 required tables exist:
```sql
SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA <DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>;
```

Expected tables:
- `SALES_TRANSACTIONS_FACT_TABLE`
- `CUSTOMER_DIMENSION_TABLE`
- `PRODUCT_CATALOG_TABLE`
- `SALES_REP_PERFORMANCE_TABLE`
- `SALES_PIPELINE_OPPORTUNITIES`
- `MARKETING_ATTRIBUTION_TABLE`

**Stop**: Confirm all values and verify tables exist before proceeding.

### Step 2: Create Semantic View

**Execute:**

```sql
CALL SYSTEM$CREATE_SEMANTIC_VIEW_FROM_YAML(
  '<DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>',
  $$

```

**Verify creation:**
```sql
SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS IN SCHEMA <DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>;
```

### Step 3: Create Cortex Agent

**Execute:**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE AGENT <DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.SALES_OPS_AGENT
  COMMENT = 'Sales Operations analytics agent'
  FROM SPECIFICATION $$
  instructions:
    system: >
      You are a Sales Operations analyst. Help users explore revenue trends, pipeline health,
      sales rep performance, customer segmentation, product mix, and marketing attribution.
      Provide clear, data-driven answers. When presenting numbers, use appropriate formatting
      (currency for USD values, percentages for rates). Always include relevant context.
    response: >
      Provide concise, actionable answers about sales operations data. Include relevant
      numbers and comparisons when helpful.
  tools:
    - tool_spec:
        type: cortex_analyst_text_to_sql
        name: sales_ops_analyst
        description: >
          Analyzes sales operations data including revenue, pipeline, rep performance,
          customer health, product catalog, and marketing attribution.
  tool_resources:
    sales_ops_analyst:
      semantic_view: <DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.SALES_OPS_SEMANTIC_VIEW
      execution_environment:
        type: warehouse
        warehouse: <WAREHOUSE>
  $$;
```

**Verify creation:**
```sql
DESCRIBE AGENT <DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.SALES_OPS_AGENT;
```

---

### Step 4: Test the Agent

**Execute these test queries to validate the agent works:**

```sql
-- Test 1: Revenue by region (verified query match)
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.DATA_AGENT_RUN(
  '<DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.SALES_OPS_AGENT',
  '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What is total revenue by region?"}]}]}'
) AS AGENT_RESPONSE;
```

```sql
-- Test 2: Rep performance (single table)
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.DATA_AGENT_RUN(
  '<DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.SALES_OPS_AGENT',
  '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Which 5 reps have the highest quota attainment?"}]}]}'
) AS AGENT_RESPONSE;
```

```sql
-- Test 3: Pipeline analysis (multi-dimension)
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.DATA_AGENT_RUN(
  '<DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.SALES_OPS_AGENT',
  '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What is pipeline value by stage and how many deals have competitors?"}]}]}'
) AS AGENT_RESPONSE;
```

Verify each test returns valid data with SQL generated by Cortex Analyst.

**Stop**: Confirm all tests pass before proceeding.

---

### Step 5: Create MCP Server

**Execute:**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MCP SERVER <DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.SALES_OPS_MCP_SERVER
  COMMENT = 'MCP Server exposing Sales Ops Agent for Amazon QuickSight'
  FROM SPECIFICATION $$
  tools:
    - title: "Sales Ops Agent"
      name: "sales_ops_agent"
      type: "CORTEX_AGENT_RUN"
      identifier: "<DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.SALES_OPS_AGENT"
      description: "Ask questions about sales operations data including revenue, pipeline, rep performance, customers, products, and marketing."
  $$;
```

**Grant permissions:**

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON MCP SERVER <DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.SALES_OPS_MCP_SERVER TO ROLE CORTEX_QUICK_HOL_ROLE;
GRANT USAGE ON AGENT <DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.SALES_OPS_AGENT TO ROLE CORTEX_QUICK_HOL_ROLE;
GRANT SELECT ON SEMANTIC VIEW CORTEX_QUICK_HOL_DB.CORTEX_QUICK_HOL_SCHEMA.SALES_OPS_SEMANTIC_VIEW TO ROLE CORTEX_QUICK_HOL_ROLE;
```

**Verify creation:**
```sql
SHOW MCP SERVERS IN SCHEMA <DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>;
```

---

### Step 6: Create OAuth Integration

**Execute:**

```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
```
**Stop**: Confirm if ACCOUNTADMIN role is used, which is required for next step - to create security integration.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE SECURITY INTEGRATION SALES_OPS_QUICK_SUITE_OAUTH
    TYPE = OAUTH
    ENABLED = TRUE
    OAUTH_CLIENT = CUSTOM
    OAUTH_CLIENT_TYPE = 'CONFIDENTIAL'
    OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI = 'https://us-west-2.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/oauthcallback'
    OAUTH_ISSUE_REFRESH_TOKENS = TRUE
    OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_VALIDITY = 86400;
```

**Get OAuth credentials:**

```sql
SELECT SYSTEM$SHOW_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS('SALES_OPS_QUICK_SUITE_OAUTH');
```

**Present credentials to user:**

```
Save these credentials for QuickSight configuration:

OAUTH_CLIENT_ID:     <value from query>
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET: <value from query>
```

**Stop**: Ensure user has copied both values before proceeding.

---

### Step 7: Configure Amazon QuickSight (Manual Steps)

**Present these instructions to the user:**

```
AMAZON QUICKSIGHT CONFIGURATION
================================

1. Open the Amazon QuickSight console

2. Navigate to: Manage QuickSight -> Integrations -> Click "Add" (+)

3. On the "Create Integration" page, enter:

   Name:                Sales Ops Cortex Agent
   Description:         Snowflake Sales Ops analytics via MCP
   MCP server endpoint: https://<ACCOUNT>.snowflakecomputing.com/api/v2/databases/<DATABASE>/schemas/<SCHEMA>/mcp-servers/SALES_OPS_MCP_SERVER

4. Click "Next"

5. Select authentication: "User authentication (OAuth)"

6. Select: "Manual configuration"

7. Fill in OAuth details:

   Client ID:      <OAUTH_CLIENT_ID from Step 6>
   Client Secret:  <OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET from Step 6>
   Token URL:      https://<ACCOUNT>.snowflakecomputing.com/oauth/token-request
   Auth URL:       https://<ACCOUNT>.snowflakecomputing.com/oauth/authorize
   Redirect URL:   https://us-west-2.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/oauthcallback

8. Click "Create and continue"

**Present final instructions:**

```
COMPLETE THE CONNECTION
=======================

1. Return to Amazon QuickSight
2. Navigate to Integrations
3. Find your MCP integration
4. Click to authenticate with your Snowflake credentials
5. Done! The Sales Ops Agent is now available in QuickSight.

TEST YOUR AGENT
===============

Ask questions like:
- "What is total revenue by region?"
- "Which reps have the highest quota attainment?"
- "What is pipeline value by stage?"

IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS
=====================
- MCP operations have a 60-second timeout
- Tool lists are static after registration (refresh manually)
```

## Quick Reference

### Objects Created

| Object | Name |
|--------|------|
| Semantic View | `<DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.SALES_OPS_SEMANTIC_VIEW` |
| Cortex Agent | `<DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.SALES_OPS_AGENT` |
| MCP Server | `<DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.SALES_OPS_MCP_SERVER` |
| OAuth Integration | `SALES_OPS_QUICK_SUITE_OAUTH` |

### Key URLs

| URL | Value |
|-----|-------|
| MCP Endpoint | `https://<ACCOUNT>.snowflakecomputing.com/api/v2/databases/<DATABASE>/schemas/<SCHEMA>/mcp-servers/SALES_OPS_MCP_SERVER` |
| Auth URL | `https://<ACCOUNT>.snowflakecomputing.com/oauth/authorize` |
| Token URL | `https://<ACCOUNT>.snowflakecomputing.com/oauth/token-request` |

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Object does not exist"
```sql
SHOW MCP SERVERS IN SCHEMA <DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>;
SHOW GRANTS ON MCP SERVER <DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.SALES_OPS_MCP_SERVER;
```

### OAuth errors
```sql
DESCRIBE SECURITY INTEGRATION SALES_OPS_QUICK_SUITE_OAUTH;
-- Verify OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI matches the QuickSight-generated URL exactly
```

### Agent not responding
```sql
-- Test agent directly first:
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.DATA_AGENT_RUN(
  '<DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.SALES_OPS_AGENT',
  '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What is total revenue?"}]}]}'
);
```

### Timeout errors (HTTP 424)
- QuickSight MCP has a 60-second timeout
- Use simpler prompts or optimize queries

---

## Cleanup

```sql
DROP MCP SERVER IF EXISTS <DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.SALES_OPS_MCP_SERVER;
DROP AGENT IF EXISTS <DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.SALES_OPS_AGENT;
DROP SEMANTIC VIEW IF EXISTS <DATABASE>.<SCHEMA>.SALES_OPS_SEMANTIC_VIEW;
DROP SECURITY INTEGRATION IF EXISTS SALES_OPS_QUICK_SUITE_OAUTH;
```

---

## Stopping Points

- After Step 1: Confirm database/schema/warehouse/account values
- After Step 4: Verify all agent tests pass
- After Step 6: Ensure OAuth credentials are saved
- After Step 7: Wait for Redirect URL from QuickSight

## Output

- Semantic View with 6 tables, relationships, and verified queries
- Cortex Agent powered by Cortex Analyst text-to-SQL
- MCP Server exposing the agent
- OAuth Security Integration for Amazon QuickSight
- Working end-to-end connection from QuickSight to Snowflake
