# Add a component to Sona UI

This skill captures the complete pipeline for landing a new component in this
library so nothing is forgotten. The library is a shadcn-style registry: source
components live in `src/registry/`, are described in a hand-authored registry
JSON, surfaced in docs (MDX) and a live playground, and then compiled by a build
script into generated artifacts that the app and the `shadcn` CLI consume.

The golden rule: **you hand-author seven things, then run the build commands that
regenerate everything else.** Editing a generated file directly is wasted work —
the next build overwrites it.

## The canonical reference

`spotlight-card` is the cleanest existing example of every step done correctly.
Before writing anything, read these to match the house style exactly:

- `src/registry/sonaui/spotlight-card/spotlight-card.tsx`
- `src/registry/examples/spotlight-card/spotlight-card-demo.tsx`
- `src/content/docs/spotlight-card.mdx`
- the `spotlight-card` entries in `src/registry/registry.json`,
  `src/registry/agent-metadata.ts`, `src/config/components.ts`, and
  `src/registry/playground/index.tsx`

Mirror its structure for the new component rather than inventing a layout.

## Inputs to settle first

Pin these down before editing (ask the user only for what you can't infer):

- **Slug**: kebab-case, used everywhere as the key (`spotlight-card`). Directory
  names, registry `name`, doc filename, and every registry key must match it.
- **Display title**: Title Case (`Spotlight Card`).
- **Category**: which nav group in `components.ts` (`Components`, `Text`,
  `Effects`, …). The user's pipeline note calls for an **Effects** category — use
  it if the component is a visual effect, otherwise pick the fitting existing one.
- **Props**: name, type, default, one-line description for each — these flow into
  the generated prop table, so get them right at the source.
- **npm dependencies**: runtime packages the component imports (e.g. `motion`).

## The seven hand-authored edits

Do these in order. Match formatting, the `cn` import, `"use client"`, and the
`export default` convention from the reference.

### 1. Component source — `src/registry/sonaui/<slug>/<slug>.tsx`

The real component. Export an interface named `<Pascal>Props` and **JSDoc every
prop** — the `@default` tag and the `/** … */` description are parsed verbatim
by the prop-types build into the docs table. A missing JSDoc comment means a
blank cell in the published props table, so treat the comments as user-facing.
Include `@default` on every optional prop. If the component needs extra files
(CSS module, sub-component), add them in the same folder — the build picks up
every file in the directory.

### 2. Demo — `src/registry/examples/<slug>/<slug>-demo.tsx`

The default, prop-less example shown in the docs Preview. File name
`<slug>-demo.tsx` maps to the `default` variant. For extra variants, add
`<slug>-<variant>.tsx` in the same folder (the build keys them by the suffix
after the component name; see `parseFileName` in `scripts/build-registry.ts`).

### 3. Registry entry — `src/registry/registry.json`

This is the hand-authored source of truth (a JSON **array**), NOT the root
`registry.json` or `public/r/*` — those are generated. Add an object with a real
`title`, a real `description` (a sentence about what it does, not "Component for
<slug>"), the file path(s) under `files`, and `dependencies` listing the npm
packages from step 1. Follow the exact shape of the spotlight-card entry.

### 4. Docs — `src/content/docs/<slug>.mdx`

Copy the spotlight-card MDX skeleton: frontmatter (`title`, `slug`, `tags`), an
intro, a `## Features` list, then the standard MDX component blocks in this
order — `<ComponentPreview component="<slug>" name="default" />`,
`## Playground` + `<ComponentPlayground component="<slug>" />`,
`## Installation` + `<ComponentInstallation component="<slug>" />`,
`## Usage` + `<ComponentUsage component="<slug>" />`,
`## Props` + `<PropTable component="<slug>" />`. The prop table is **derived** —
don't hand-write prop rows in the MDX.

### 5. Nav entry — `src/config/components.ts`

Add one object to `componentNavigationLinks`: `name` (Title), `slug`,
`href: "/docs/<slug>"`, and `type` set to the chosen category. If the category
is new (e.g. first **Effects** entry didn't exist yet) just use the string — the
nav groups by `type` automatically.

### 6. Playground controls — `src/registry/playground/index.tsx`

Import the component at the top, then add one entry to `playgroundRegistry` keyed
by slug: a `controls` array (slider / text / toggle / select — see the `Control`
union at the top of the file) for the props worth exposing, and a `render` that
instantiates the real component with the live values cast to their types. This
file is intentionally hand-authored and decoupled from the generated example
registry.

### 7. Agent metadata — `src/registry/agent-metadata.ts`

Add a `"<slug>"` entry to the `agentResourceMetadata` object with `useWhen`,
`avoidWhen`, `capabilities`, `accessibility`, `motion` (`purpose` +
`reducedMotion`), and a `related` array of sibling slugs. Mirror the
spotlight-card entry's shape. Without it, `bun run check:agent-resources`
rejects the publish — every `registry:ui` item must have a matching entry.

## Then build — regenerate everything else

```bash
bun run build:registry
bun run build:agent-resources
bun run check:registry
bun run check:agent-resources
```

`build:registry` runs three scripts in sequence and regenerates:

- `src/registry/index.ts` (the example registry + code strings)
- root `registry.json` and `public/r/*.json` (shadcn CLI registry)
- `src/registry/prop-types.ts` (the props table data, parsed from your JSDoc)

`build:agent-resources` regenerates `public/agent/catalog.json`, the
per-component detail JSON at `public/agent/components/<slug>.json`, and
`public/llms.txt` / `public/llms-full.txt` from the `agent-metadata.ts` entry
added in step 7.

All of these are **generated — never edit them by hand.** If a prop is missing
or a description is wrong in the output, fix the JSDoc in step 1 (or the
metadata in step 7) and rebuild. Do not treat the component as published
until both `check:registry` and `check:agent-resources` pass.

After building, sanity-check that the new slug appears in
`src/registry/prop-types.ts` with all expected props, and that
`public/r/<slug>.json` and `public/agent/components/<slug>.json` were created.

## Finally — verify live in the preview

The component isn't "done" until you've seen it work. Use the preview tools (not
a manual hand-off):

1. Start the dev server (`preview_start`) if one isn't running.
2. Navigate to `/docs/<slug>` and `preview_snapshot` to confirm the page renders
   with Preview, Playground, Installation, Usage, and the Props table populated.
3. Exercise the actual interaction (hover, drag, type into a playground control)
   with `preview_click` / `preview_fill` / `preview_eval`, then re-snapshot or
   `preview_screenshot` to prove the effect and the playground controls work.
4. Check `preview_console_logs` for errors.

Report what you verified with a screenshot or snapshot, and call out anything the
user still needs to decide (e.g. extra variants, copy tweaks).

## Quick checklist

- [ ] `src/registry/sonaui/<slug>/<slug>.tsx` — component + JSDoc'd `<Pascal>Props`
- [ ] `src/registry/examples/<slug>/<slug>-demo.tsx` — default demo (+ variants)
- [ ] `src/registry/registry.json` — entry with real title/description/dependencies
- [ ] `src/content/docs/<slug>.mdx` — Preview · Playground · Installation · Usage · PropTable
- [ ] `src/config/components.ts` — nav entry under the right category
- [ ] `src/registry/playground/index.tsx` — import + controls/render entry
- [ ] `src/registry/agent-metadata.ts` — `<slug>` entry with useWhen/avoidWhen/capabilities/accessibility/motion
- [ ] `bun run build:registry` — regenerates index.ts, public/r/*.json, prop-types.ts
- [ ] `bun run build:agent-resources` — regenerates public/agent/*, public/llms*.txt
- [ ] `bun run check:registry` and `bun run check:agent-resources` — both pass
- [ ] Verified live in preview (DOM + interaction)
