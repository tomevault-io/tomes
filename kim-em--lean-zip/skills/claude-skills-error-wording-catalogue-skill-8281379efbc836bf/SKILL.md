description: Use when writing a test that must match an error message thrown by lean-zip — bomb-limit tests, malformed-archive assertThrows, CD/LH consistency assertions, or any `.toBaseIO` + `msg.contains` block. Tabulates the error-substring families so you pick the right match string the first time.

# Error-Wording Catalogue (lean-zip)

Project-local reference for choosing the `msg.contains "..."`
substring when asserting a failure path. Picking the wrong one fails CI with
confusing "unexpected error" output; picking an over-specific
one makes the test brittle to message rewrites.

## Canonical substrings by subsystem

| Subsystem | Emits from | Full message (approx.) | Recommended match substring |
|-----------|------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| FFI whole-buffer decoders | `c/zlib_ffi.c` | `ZLib: decompressed data exceeds limit (…)` | `"exceeds limit"` |
| FFI streaming decoders (gzip) | `Zip/Gzip.lean` (`decompressStream`, `decompressFile`) | `gzip: decompressed stream exceeds limit (<N> bytes)` | `"exceeds limit"` |
| FFI streaming decoders (raw deflate) | `Zip/RawDeflate.lean` (`decompressStream`) | `raw deflate: decompressed stream exceeds limit (<N> bytes)` | `"exceeds limit"` |
| Archive per-entry bomb | `Zip/Archive.lean` | `Archive: entry <name> exceeds limit (…)` | `"exceeds limit"` |
| Whole-archive bomb | `Zip/Archive.lean`, `Zip/Tar.lean` (`extract` `maxTotalSize`) | `zip:`/`tar: total extracted size (…) exceeds whole-archive limit (…)` | `"exceeds whole-archive limit"` |
| Archive ZIP64 span check | `Zip/Archive.lean` | `Archive: local data span for <name> (…)` | `"local data span"` |
| Archive CD/LH consistency | `Zip/Archive.lean` | `mismatch between CD and local header (<field>)` | `"mismatch between CD and local header"` |
| Archive CD stored-method size invariant | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`parseCentralDir`, post-ZIP64-resolution) | `zip: stored-method size mismatch for <name> (method=0, compressedSize=<C>, uncompressedSize=<U>)` | `"stored-method size mismatch"` |
| Archive CD empty-entry CRC invariant | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`parseCentralDir`, post-ZIP64-resolution, immediately after the stored-method size invariant) | `zip: CD entry CRC must be zero when uncompressedSize is zero (crc=<C>, uncompressedSize=<U>) for <name> at CD offset <pos>` | `"CD entry CRC must be zero when uncompressedSize is zero"` — APPNOTE §4.4.7 CRC32 identity: the empty byte string has CRC32 `0x00000000` (start state `0xFFFFFFFF`; no data; final complement returns `0`), so `uncompSize == 0 → crc == 0` is a universal mathematical invariant that every correct writer (Info-ZIP, Go `archive/zip`, CPython `zipfile`, 7-Zip, lean-zip's own `create`) obeys. The `uncompSize == 0` probe runs first so the CRC field is inspected only when the empty-file premise holds; attribution pins on the empty-file invariant, not a generic CRC check. Method-agnostic (applies to both stored and deflate — a deflate-encoded empty stream has `compSize = 2` but `uncompSize = 0`). Distinct from the CD/LH `crc32` consistency check (`"crc32 mismatch between CD and local header"`, PR #1728 — which catches CD-vs-LH skew regardless of sizes) and from the post-extraction `"CRC32 mismatch"` guard at `Zip/Archive.lean` (which compares *actual computed* CRC against the advertised value only after I/O has been performed). The substring is long and structurally unique — no other error message in the project contains the phrase `"CRC must be zero"`. Sibling of `"stored-method size mismatch"` (PR #1773) at the CD-parse mathematical-invariant family: both are tautological invariants that every writer satisfies but crafted archives can violate |
| Archive CD compression-method allowlist | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`parseCentralDir`, pre-ZIP64-resolution, after `name` decode) | `zip: unsupported compression method <method> for <name> (lean-zip supports method 0 (stored) and method 8 (deflate))` | `"unsupported compression method"` (distinct from the late `"unsupported method"` dispatch in `readEntryData` — see precedence note below) |
| Archive CD general-purpose flag reserved/unused bits | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`parseCentralDir`, pre-ZIP64-resolution, immediately after the method-allowlist check and before the per-feature-bit checks) | `zip: CD entry flags reserved bits set (flags=<flags>) for <name> at CD offset <pos>; APPNOTE §4.4.4 bits 7,8,9,10,12,14,15 are reserved/unused and lean-zip rejects archives that set any of them` | `"flags reserved bits set"` — APPNOTE §4.4.4 reserved/unused mask `0xD780` (`0b1101_0111_1000_0000`): bits 7-10 ("Currently unused"), bit 12 ("Reserved by PKWARE for enhanced compression"), bits 14-15 ("Reserved by PKWARE"). Distinguishable from the sibling per-feature-bit substrings (`"patched-data flag bit 5 set"` PR #1824, `"encryption-related flag bit"` in-flight PR #1771 / issue #1762, etc.) and from the CD/LH flags-consistency substring (`"flags mismatch between CD and local header"`, PR #1715) — both contain the word `flags`, so matching the bare word is ambiguous. The reserved-bits guard fires on the seven-bit aggregate mask `0xD780` (no per-bit attribution since each bit is documented identically); per-feature-bit guards fire on individual bit values for triage purposes. Bits 1 and 2 (compression-option per APPNOTE §4.4.4) are explicitly out of scope (Info-ZIP / 7-Zip legitimately set them on `method == 8` payloads); the mask `0xD780` is disjoint from the unsupported-feature mask `0x2071` (bits 0/4/5/6/13). Sibling of `"internalAttrs reserved bits set"` (PR #1819) at the writer-zero / reserved-bits family — both close a `UInt16`-field reserved-bit smuggling vector |
| Archive CD general-purpose flag bit-5 (compressed patched data) | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`parseCentralDir`, pre-ZIP64-resolution, immediately after the reserved-bits mask guard) | `zip: CD entry patched-data flag bit 5 set (flags=<flags>) for <name> at CD offset <pos>; lean-zip does not support APPNOTE §4.4.4 compressed patched data` | `"patched-data flag bit 5 set"` — distinguishable from the sibling encryption-related flag-bit family (`"encryption-related flag bit"`, in-flight PR #1771 / issue #1762), from the new reserved-bits substring (`"flags reserved bits set"`, PR #2237 — reserved/unused mask `0xD780`, disjoint from the bit-5 mask `0x0020`), and from the CD/LH flags-consistency check (`"flags mismatch between CD and local header"`, PR #1715). The bit-5 check rejects archives where CD and LH agree on the flag word (bit 5 set on both); the CD/LH check rejects archives where they disagree modulo bit 3 |
| Archive CD versionNeededToExtract upper bound | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`parseCentralDir`, pre-ZIP64-resolution, after `name` decode) | `zip: unsupported versionNeededToExtract (<v>) for <name> at CD offset <pos>; lean-zip supports values up to 45 (ZIP64)` | `"unsupported versionNeededToExtract"` — must include the `"unsupported "` prefix to distinguish from the `"LH versionNeededToExtract"` CD/LH-downgrade substring below; both messages contain the word `versionNeededToExtract`, so matching bare `"versionNeededToExtract"` is ambiguous |
| Archive CD/LH versionNeededToExtract downgrade | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`readEntryData`, one-sided `LH > CD` check) | `zip: LH versionNeededToExtract (<lv>) exceeds CD versionNeededToExtract (<cv>) for <label>` | `"LH versionNeededToExtract"` — must include the `"LH "` prefix to distinguish from the `"unsupported versionNeededToExtract"` upper-bound substring above; the two guards live at different layers (CD-parse upper-bound before any LH read; CD/LH downgrade inside `readEntryData`) |
| Archive CD/LH lastModTime/Date | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`readEntryData`, ungated — fires even when bit 3 data-descriptor is set) | `zip: lastModTime/Date mismatch between CD and local header for <label> (CD time=<Tcd>, date=<Dcd>; LH time=<Tlh>, date=<Dlh>)` | `"lastModTime/Date mismatch"` |
| Archive CD/EOCD totalEntries | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`parseCentralDir` tail) | `zip: EOCD totalEntries mismatch (EOCD=<n>, parsed=<m>)` | `"EOCD totalEntries mismatch"` |
| Archive CD/EOCD disk-number | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`parseCentralDir` head) | `zip: EOCD disk-number mismatch (numberOfThisDisk=<n>, diskWhereCDStarts=<m>); lean-zip supports single-disk archives only` | `"EOCD disk-number mismatch"` |
| Archive CD/EOCD numEntriesThisDisk | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`parseCentralDir` head) | `zip: EOCD numEntriesThisDisk mismatch (this-disk=<n>, total=<m>)` | `"EOCD numEntriesThisDisk mismatch"` |
| Archive CD entry diskNumberStart | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`parseCentralDir` per-entry loop, immediately after `commentLen` read; fires before the `entryEnd > cdEnd` span check) | `zip: CD entry diskNumberStart mismatch (diskNumberStart=<n>) for entry at CD offset <pos>; lean-zip supports single-disk archives only` | `"CD entry diskNumberStart mismatch"` |
| Archive CD entry internalAttrs reserved bits | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`parseCentralDir` per-entry loop, immediately after the `diskNumberStart` guard; fires before the `entryEnd > cdEnd` span check) | `zip: CD entry internalAttrs reserved bits set (internalAttrs=<n>) for entry at CD offset <pos>` | `"internalAttrs reserved bits set"` — APPNOTE §4.4.10 defines only bit 0 ("apparent ASCII/text data"); bits 1-15 are reserved/unused, so the guard is `internalAttrs &&& 0xFFFE == 0` (preserves Info-ZIP bit-0 interop). Structurally unique across the project — `internalAttrs` appears in no other `Zip/Archive.lean` error message or assertThrows substring. Writer-zero single-field sibling of `"CD entry diskNumberStart mismatch"` (CD +34) on the same fast-fail layer |
| Archive CD entry name NUL byte | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`parseCentralDir` per-entry loop, immediately after `nameBytes := data.extract …`; fires on the raw `ByteArray` before the UTF-8 / Latin-1 decode block) | `zip: CD entry name contains NUL byte at CD offset <pos>` | `"name contains NUL byte"` — must include the `"name "` prefix to distinguish from the existing UTF-8 wording `"invalid UTF-8 in entry name (UTF-8 flag set)"` and any future name-bytes-mismatch substring (issue #1722). Matches APPNOTE §4.4.17 filename-field smuggling: NUL in filenames is a classic parser-differential / filesystem-truncation vector (POSIX `open`/`stat` truncates `evil.txt\x00.zip` to `evil.txt`; `Archive.list` callers routing on `entry.path` see the full NUL-embedded string). The guard is on the raw bytes so neither the UTF-8 nor the Latin-1 decode path re-introduces NUL into logs. Substring is short enough to survive CD-offset-value churn and specific enough to distinguish from every existing CD/LH name-related substring |
| Archive CD entry path-unsafe | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`parseCentralDir` per-entry loop, immediately after the UTF-8 / Latin-1 decode block; fires on the decoded `name : String` before the `versionNeeded` upper-bound check) | `zip: CD entry has unsafe path <name.quote> at CD offset <pos>` | `"CD entry has unsafe path"` — must include the `"CD entry has "` prefix to keep attribution at CD parse explicit; the shorter `"unsafe path"` substring is shared with the extract-time `Binary.isPathSafe` calls in [Zip/Archive.lean](/home/kim/lean-zip/Zip/Archive.lean) (the `Archive.extract` directory and regular-file arms, raising `zip: unsafe path: <entry.path>`) and with the Tar extract-time equivalent, so matching the bare `"unsafe path"` substring is ambiguous between CD-parse and extract-time layers. The existing `testdata/zip/security/{zip-slip,absolute-path,backslash-slip}.zip` fixtures assert the `"unsafe path"` substring and continue to pass because `"unsafe path"` is a substring of `"CD entry has unsafe path"` — but new tests should prefer the CD-parse-specific form so a future split between the two layers stays distinguishable. Mirrors the trailing-slash carve-out from the extract-time check (`name.endsWith "/"` → check the slash-stripped form) so legitimate directory entries are not tripped. Sibling of `"CD entry name contains NUL byte"` on the same filename-validation layer — the pair together closes the "smuggled name" attack class (byte content + path shape) |
| Archive CD entry empty filename | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`parseCentralDir` per-entry loop, immediately after the `nameLen` read at CD +28; fires on the raw `UInt16` field before `extraLen` / `commentLen` are read, before the `entryEnd > cdEnd` overrun check, and before the sibling NUL-byte / path-safety filename guards) | `zip: CD entry has empty filename (nameLen=0) at CD offset <pos>` | `"CD entry has empty filename"` — must include the `"CD entry has empty "` prefix to distinguish from the sibling `"CD entry has unsafe path"` substring (both start with `"CD entry has "`, so the shorter form is ambiguous). The two guards fire at different points in the per-entry loop: the empty-filename guard runs on the raw `nameLen` UInt16 before any decode, while the path-safety guard runs on the decoded `name : String` after the UTF-8 / Latin-1 block. Every legitimate ZIP entry has at least one byte of name (APPNOTE §4.4.10), so `nameLen == 0` is structurally pathological; writer-side at `Zip/Archive.lean` /  inherits the invariant from caller-supplied `entry.path`. Deliberate precedence: the empty-name guard fires before the CD-parse path-safety guard so failure attribution pins to the structural anomaly rather than the path-safety predicate (which would otherwise catch `""` via its empty-component rejection, but only if the decode succeeds). Sibling of `"CD entry name contains NUL byte"` (byte-content dimension) and `"CD entry has unsafe path"` (path-shape dimension) on the same filename-validation layer — the trio together closes the "smuggled name" attack class at CD parse (zero-length, NUL-embedded, and path-traversal forms all rejected pre-decode) |
| Archive CD-entry `localOffset + 30 ≤ cdOffset` archive-layout invariant | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`parseCentralDir`, post-ZIP64-resolution, before the stored-method size invariant) | `zip: entry local offset overlaps central directory for <name> (localOffset=<lo>, cdOffset=<co>)` | `"entry local offset overlaps central directory"` — the micro-shape per-entry counterpart to the macro-shape archive-level `cdOffset + cdSize ≤ eocdPos` check (`"central directory extends past EOCD"`) and to the late LH-signature check (`"bad local header signature"`) in `readEntryData`; the new substring fires first and on both `Archive.list` and `Archive.extract` paths, whereas the LH-signature check is extract-only |
| Archive ZIP64/standard-EOCD override sentinel | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`findEndOfCentralDir` ZIP64 branch) | `zip: EOCD ZIP64-override mismatch: standard EOCD <field>=<V>, ZIP64 <field>=<Z> (expected sentinel <S> or numeric match)` | `"EOCD ZIP64-override mismatch"`
| Archive ZIP64 EOCD64 record-size | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`findEndOfCentralDir` ZIP64 branch) | `zip: ZIP64 EOCD64 record-size mismatch (size=<n>, expected 44 for v1 EOCD64)` | `"ZIP64 EOCD64 record-size mismatch"` |
| Archive ZIP64 EOCD64 versionMadeBy lower-byte upper bound | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`findEndOfCentralDir` ZIP64 branch, immediately after the record-size check, at `bufPos + 12`) | `zip: ZIP64 EOCD64 versionMadeBy spec-version byte too high (versionMadeBy=<vmb>, spec-version=<lb>, max supported 63)` | `"ZIP64 EOCD64 versionMadeBy spec-version byte too high"` — must include the `"ZIP64 EOCD64 "` prefix to distinguish from the sibling per-entry CD+4 `versionMadeBy` check (issue #1812 / PR #1820, which uses the substring `"versionMadeBy spec-version byte out of range"`; both messages mention `versionMadeBy spec-version byte` so the bare phrase is ambiguous). APPNOTE §4.4.2.2 caps the lower byte at `63` (spec version 6.3); only the lower byte is checked, since host OS codes in the upper byte vary widely across real producers. Writer-side at [Zip/Archive.lean](/home/kim/lean-zip/Zip/Archive.lean) hard-codes `3 * 256 + 45 = 0x032D` (low byte 45) |
| Archive ZIP64 EOCD64 versionNeededToExtract upper bound | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`findEndOfCentralDir` ZIP64 branch, immediately after the `versionMadeBy` upper-bound check, at `bufPos + 14`) | `zip: ZIP64 EOCD64 versionNeededToExtract too high (versionNeededToExtract=<v>, max supported 63)` | `"ZIP64 EOCD64 versionNeededToExtract too high"` — must include the `"ZIP64 EOCD64 "` prefix and the `"too high"` suffix to distinguish from (a) the sibling lower-bound check `"ZIP64 EOCD64 versionNeededToExtract too low"` (issue #1758 / PR #1764, in-flight); (b) the per-entry CD +6 upper-bound substring `"unsupported versionNeededToExtract"` (row: *Archive CD versionNeededToExtract upper bound*); and (c) the CD/LH downgrade substring `"LH versionNeededToExtract"` (row: *Archive CD/LH versionNeededToExtract downgrade*). The archive-level cap is `63` (APPNOTE §4.4.3.2, spec version 6.3) rather than `45` because the EOCD64 field declares the version needed to *interpret the record* rather than to extract the largest entry. Writer-side at [Zip/Archive.lean](/home/kim/lean-zip/Zip/Archive.lean) hard-codes `45`, so `45 ≤ 63` holds trivially |
| Archive CD ZIP64 extra-field parse | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`parseCentralDir`, `parseZip64Extra` caller) | `zip: malformed ZIP64 extra field for <name>` | `"malformed ZIP64 extra field"` |
| Archive CD/LH extra-data sub-field structural check | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`validateExtraFieldStructure`, unconditionally in `parseCentralDir` / `readEntryData` before any ZIP64-sentinel guard) | CD: `zip: malformed extra field for <name>`; LH: `zip: malformed local extra field for <label>` | CD: `"malformed extra field"`; LH: `"malformed local extra field"` (both distinct from `"malformed ZIP64 extra field"`, which fires only when a sentinel is set and the inner `0x0001` block is malformed) |
| Archive CD ZIP64 duplicate extra-block | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`parseCentralDir`, `hasDuplicateZip64Extra` guard before `parseZip64Extra` call) | `zip: duplicate ZIP64 extra field for <name>` | `"duplicate ZIP64 extra field"` |
| Archive LH ZIP64 parse | `Zip/Archive.lean` | `truncated ZIP64 local extra field` | `"truncated ZIP64 local extra field"` |
| Archive LH ZIP64 duplicate extra-block | `Zip/Archive.lean` (`readEntryData`, `hasDuplicateZip64Extra` guard before `parseZip64Extra` call) | `zip: duplicate ZIP64 local extra field for <label>` | `"duplicate ZIP64 local extra field"` |
| Tar UStar header field interior-NUL byte | `Zip/Tar.lean` (`parseHeader`, post-checksum/-magic-check, pre-`Binary.readString` decode of the five UStar string fields `name` / `linkname` / `prefix` / `uname` / `gname`; the five `hasInteriorNul` guards fire in source-position order) | `tar: UStar name contains NUL byte`; `tar: UStar linkname contains NUL byte`; `tar: UStar prefix contains NUL byte`; `tar: UStar uname contains NUL byte`; `tar: UStar gname contains NUL byte` | per-slot `"UStar name contains NUL byte"` / `"UStar linkname contains NUL byte"` / `"UStar prefix contains NUL byte"` / `"UStar uname contains NUL byte"` / `"UStar gname contains NUL byte"` — must include the slot keyword. The shared family suffix `"contains NUL byte"` would also match the GNU long-name / long-link siblings (next row) and the ZIP CD entry name guard (`"CD entry name contains NUL byte"`, row above) so matching the bare suffix is ambiguous across the cross-format NUL-smuggle attack class. Fully-closed 5-slot family: 3-slot filesystem-reaching arm `name`/`linkname`/`prefix` (PRs #1880/#1934/#1937) + 2-slot defense-in-depth arm `uname`/`gname` (PRs #1944/#1957). The 3-slot filesystem-reaching arm (`name` / `linkname` / `prefix`) is closed by PRs #1880/#1934/#1937 with per-slot fixtures `ustar-name-nul-in-name.tar`, `ustar-linkname-nul-in-name.tar`, `ustar-prefix-nul-in-name.tar`. The 2-slot defense-in-depth arm `uname`/`gname` is closed by PR #1944 with `ustar-uname-nul-in-uname.tar` and PR #1957 with `ustar-gname-nul-in-gname.tar` — neither `uname` nor `gname` reaches the filesystem in `Tar.extract` (unlike `name` / `linkname` / `prefix`); both are exposed via `Entry.uname` / `Entry.gname` to `Tar.list` callers (a caller routing on either for a trust decision would otherwise see only the truncated prefix while peer parsers preserve the full bytes), so the two guards are defense-in-depth at the `Tar.list` layer. All five guards run after the checksum + magic checks (so header integrity is confirmed first) and before any `Binary.readString` call on these fields. Sibling of the ZIP CD `"CD entry name contains NUL byte"` row above (PR #1831) and of the GNU long-name / long-link row below (PRs #1865/#1953) on the same cross-format NUL-smuggle attack class |
| Tar GNU long-name / long-link interior-NUL byte | `Zip/Tar.lean` (`forEntries`, after `readBoundedEntryData` + `stripTrailingNuls` on the pseudo-entry payload, before the UTF-8 / Latin-1 decode block; one `findIdx? (· == 0)` guard per pseudo-entry type, gated by `entry.typeflag == typeGnuLongName` / `typeGnuLongLink`) | `tar: GNU long-name contains NUL byte`; `tar: GNU long-link contains NUL byte` | per-slot `"GNU long-name contains NUL byte"` / `"GNU long-link contains NUL byte"` — must include the hyphenated slot keyword. The shared family suffix `"contains NUL byte"` would also match the UStar siblings (row above) and the ZIP CD entry name guard (`"CD entry name contains NUL byte"`, row above) so matching the bare suffix is ambiguous. Fully-closed 2-slot family: PR #1865 (long-name slot, `gnu-longname-nul-in-name.tar`) + PR #1953 (long-link slot, `gnu-longlink-nul-in-link.tar`), matching the UStar `name`/`linkname`/`prefix`/`uname`/`gname` per-slot campaign. Both guards run after the per-pseudo-entry `maxHeaderSize` cap (`"exceeds maximum header size"`, row below) so payload size is bounded first; the writer-side at `buildHeader` would have to emit a literal `\x00` byte into the GNU long-name / long-link payload to trip these guards on its own output, which `Tar.create` cannot do via the public `entry.path` / `entry.linkname` surface |
| Tar PAX extended-header duplicate-key | `Zip/Tar.lean` (`parsePaxRecords` records-loop body, after the `String.fromUTF8?` UTF-8 decode and after the `findIdx? (· == 0)` raw-bytes NUL silent-skip filter; fires only when the offending key passes both UTF-8 and NUL-byte gates and matches an already-recorded key) | `tar: PAX extended header has duplicate <key.quote> record` (the `<key.quote>` is `String.quote`-formatted and varies per fixture) | `"PAX extended header has duplicate"` — the `String.quote`-formatted key value is intentionally elided so the substring is stable under any key payload (avoid matching `"duplicate "` alone — it is short and would collide with future `"duplicate ZIP64 …"`-style messages or any future tar duplicate-field check). PR #1899 introduces the guard with fixture `pax-duplicate-path.tar` (smuggles two `path=` records inside a single PAX extended header to exercise the last-wins-vs-first-wins parser-differential). Throw-side dual to the PAX silent-skip row below: both fire on the same `parsePaxRecords` surface, but the silent-skip filter drops a record whose raw key/value bytes carry a NUL while the duplicate-key throw fires when NUL-clean records collide — together they close both the smuggle-via-NUL and last-wins-vs-first-wins parser-differential vectors at the PAX-records layer |
| Tar PAX extended-header NUL-byte silent-skip | `Zip/Tar.lean` (`parsePaxRecords` records-loop body, the `findIdx? (· == 0) .isNone` filter on `keyBytes` / `valueBytes`; the offending record is dropped from the returned `records` array — this is **not** a `throw`, so there is no `IO.userError` substring) | *(silent skip — no `IO.userError`; the offending PAX record is simply omitted from the `records` array returned to `applyPaxOverrides`)* | *(no `assertThrows` substring — attribution is fixture-only)* — the convention is **attribution-by-recovered-value**: assert that extraction does **not** throw and that the smuggled value is absent from the recovered metadata. Fixture `pax-path-nul-in-value.tar` (PR #1866) is the canonical probe — it pairs a smuggled `path=a\x00b/c` PAX override with a regular `hello.txt` UStar entry; the listing assertion confirms `entry.path` stays at the regular header's `"hello.txt"` rather than being overridden to the NUL-truncation target `"a"` (POSIX `open(2)` truncation-at-NUL would otherwise smuggle a payload past `Binary.isPathSafe` into `Tar.extract`). This row is documentation-of-convention only — silent-skip guards do not fit the `assertThrows` substring schema; tests use the `Tar.list` recovered-metadata path instead.

## FFI vs native: the user-visible split

`"exceeds limit"` is emitted by the FFI path (`c/zlib_ffi.c`) and by
the archive/tar per-entry size check (which measures against the
caller-supplied `maxEntrySize`). `"exceeds maximum size"` is emitted
by the native Lean path (`Zip/Native/Inflate.lean`,
`Zip/Native/Gzip.lean`) when the output budget is exhausted inside
the Lean-level inflater.

A third family — `"exceeds maximum header size"` — was added in
#1597 for the Tar header-path pseudo-entries (GNU long-name /
long-link, PAX extended / global). It sits on a *separate* knob
(`maxHeaderSize`, default 8 MiB) from the per-entry cap
(`maxEntrySize`), so a test that wants to exercise the header cap
**must** match the long form — `"exceeds maximum header size"` —
not bare `"exceeds"` or `"exceeds limit"`, both of which would
also succeed against the payload path and produce false positives.

This divergence is **intentional today** but documented as a
Track E Priority 2 item 4 follow-up candidate — if you are landing a
test that needs to be stable under a future rewording, match the
short shared noun (`"exceeds"`) only after reading the source and
confirming no other message in the call graph contains it.

**Streaming-FFI docstring phrasing differs from whole-buffer
phrasing.** Streaming FFI docstrings (post-#1610 / #1631) use
*"bomb-unsafe — only do this when the input is trusted"* while
whole-buffer docstrings (post-#1573) use *"bomb-unsafe for
untrusted input"*. Mild drift, not a bug. Tests that grep on
docstring text (there are currently none) should match
*"bomb-unsafe"* as the stable substring.

## Which message fires first

When a function composes several checks, the *earlier* check wins.
Knowing the order matters for picking the right substring:

- **`Tar.extractTarGzNative`**: calls `Zip.Native.GzipDecode.decompress`,
  which calls `Zip.Native.Inflate.inflateRaw`. When
  `maxOutputSize := 10` is passed and input is larger, the Inflate-level
  check (`"Inflate: output exceeds maximum size"`) fires before the
  outer GzipDecode/`"too large"` check. Match `"exceeds maximum size"`,
  not `"too large"`. See #1561.
- **`Archive.readEntryData` on a malformed ZIP64 LH**: the strict LH
  ZIP64 parse check (`"truncated ZIP64 local extra field"`, added in
  #1554) fires before the existing `"size mismatch"` check. A fixture
  that previously matched `"size mismatch"` must be updated — or
  supplemented by a companion fixture with consistent LH/CD metadata
  and a deliberately wrong decompressed size.
- **`Archive.readEntryData` on an oversized ZIP64 compressedSize
  claim**: the second `assertSpanInFile` (span check for local data)
  fires before the read is attempted. Match `"local data span"`. See
  #1543.
- **`Archive.extract` on a method=0 archive with mismatched CD sizes**:
  the `parseCentralDir` stored-method size-invariant check
  (`"stored-method size mismatch"`) fires before `readEntryData` runs,
  so it precedes the `"local data span"` check (#1497, #1543) and the
  `"truncated ZIP64 local extra field"` check (#1554) for the subset of
  fixtures where method=0 and the CD-resolved `compSize ≠ uncompSize`.
  The three `oversized-*.zip` fixtures in `testdata/zip/malformed/`
  all shifted to this substring as of the CD-parse-guard addition. If
  you need a regression that still exercises the later span or
  ZIP64-truncation checks, use method=8 (deflate) with the oversized
  claim so the stored-method check does not fire.
- **`Archive.extract` on an archive whose CD `method` is outside
  `{0, 8}`**: the `parseCentralDir` compression-method allowlist
  (`"unsupported compression method"`, added in PR #1801) fires
  pre-ZIP64-resolution and shadows the late `readEntryData`
  `"unsupported method"` dispatch for all CD-parseable archives.
  `bad-method.zip` (CD/LH method=14) and `cd-bad-method-early.zip`
  (CD/LH method=6) both trip the new substring; the late
  `"unsupported method"` throw is preserved as defense-in-depth
  but is unreachable via the public API today. If you need a
  regression that still exercises the late dispatch, you would
  need to bypass `parseCentralDir` — currently impossible from the
  public API. Substring discipline: match
  `"unsupported compression method"` (the new wording, with the
  word "compression"); the bare `"unsupported method"` substring
  also matches the new message (it's a substring of the new
  wording), but tests should prefer the more specific form so a
  future split between the two layers stays distinguishable.
- **`Tar.extract` on an archive-slip symlink**: the unsafe-symlink
  reject fires before `Handle.createSymlink`. Match
  `"unsafe symlink"`. See #1555.
- **`Tar.extract` on a backslash path**: `Binary.isPathSafe` on the
  regular path component fires before any typeflag-specific branch.
  Match `"unsafe path"` even for `typeSymlink` entries whose linkname
  would *also* be rejected. See #1555.

## Probe-then-finalise workflow

Don't guess. Write the assertion with a placeholder substring and
let the test surface the real error:

    unless msg.contains "<<PROBE>>" do
      throw (IO.userError s!"unexpected error: {msg}")

Then `lake exe test` will print the actual `msg` in its failure
output. Copy the matching substring from there into the final
assertion and re-run.

This is cheaper than reading three source files to trace which
branch fires, and it catches the case where a new check has been
added in a recent PR.

## When to match `"exceeds"` vs something more specific

- **Bomb tests** that just want "budget exhausted, somewhere":
  match `"exceeds"` (works for both FFI and native). Note this in
  a comment so the next reader knows the test is deliberately
  subsystem-agnostic.
- **Subsystem-specific tests** (e.g., testing that the native path
  took a specific branch): match the subsystem's specific substring
  from the table above.
- **Regression tests for a specific PR**: match the substring the
  PR introduced, so future refactors that reword the message
  surface the test failure loudly.

## Maintenance

When a Track E PR changes an error message, the PR must update this
skill in the same commit. That's also the rule for the reverse
direction: if this catalogue doesn't name a substring you need,
add a row before the test lands.
