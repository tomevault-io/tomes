# Zstd Implementation Patterns (RFC 8878)

Patterns for implementing the Zstd decompression pipeline in `Zip/Native/`.

## File Layout

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Zip/Native/ZstdFrame.lean` | Frame/block parsing, literals section, sequence header, sequence execution |
| `Zip/Native/ZstdHuffman.lean` | Huffman tree descriptor parsing, weight decoding, symbol decoding |
| `Zip/Native/Fse.lean` | FSE distribution decoding, table construction, backward bitstream, symbol decoding |
| `Zip/Native/XxHash.lean` | XXH64 hash for content checksums |
| `ZipTest/ZstdNativeConformance.lean` | End-to-end conformance matrix (FFI compress + native decompress) |
| `ZipTest/ZstdNativeComponents.lean` | Unit tests for individual Zstd components |
| `ZipTest/ZstdNativeIntegration.lean` | Integration tests for Zstd pipeline |

New Zstd features go in one of these existing files. Only create a new
file if the module is genuinely independent (like XXH64 was).

## Backward Bitstream (MSB-First)

Zstd's ANS coding reads bits **MSB-first** from a backward stream — opposite of
DEFLATE's LSB-first `BitReader`:

| Property | DEFLATE `BitReader` | Zstd `BackwardBitReader` |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Bit order | LSB-first | MSB-first |
| Direction | Forward (start→end) | Backward (end→start) |
| Initialization | Position 0 | Find sentinel bit in last byte |
| Sentinel | None | Highest set bit in last byte consumed on init |

### Sentinel Bit Protocol

The last byte of a Zstd bitstream has a sentinel: the highest set bit.
This bit is **consumed during initialization** (not part of data). The
remaining lower bits in that byte are the first bits to read.

```lean
-- BackwardBitReader.init finds sentinel, masks it out
let mask := (1 <<< sentinelPos.toUInt8) - 1
let maskedByte := lastByte &&& mask
```

If the sentinel is bit 0 (byte value 0x01), the entire last byte is
consumed and reading continues from the previous byte.

### MSB-First Reading

Each `readBits n` call reads `n` bits from highest-available down:

```lean
let bitPos := br.bitsRemaining - 1
let bit := (br.currentByte >>> bitPos.toUInt8) &&& 1
let acc' := (acc <<< 1) ||| bit.toUInt32
```

When `bitsRemaining` hits 0, move to the previous byte (`bytePos - 1`).

## FSE Table Construction

Three-phase algorithm (RFC 8878 §4.1.1):

### Phase 1: Distribution Decoding (`decodeFseDistribution`)

- Variable-width encoding: smaller probabilities use fewer bits
- Special value: probability -1 means "less than 1" (occupies exactly 1 cell)
- Probability 0 triggers a run-length encoding of consecutive zero-probability symbols
- Use `Int32` for probabilities to naturally represent -1

**PITFALL — `readProbValue` bit combination order**: The NCount variable-length
encoding reads a short value (bitsNeeded-1 bits) then conditionally an extra bit.
The bits are LSB-first: the first-read bits are the LOW bits, the extra bit is
the HIGH bit. The correct logic is:
- If `rawBits < lowThreshold`: value = rawBits (short path, no extra bit)
- Else read 1 extra bit:
  - If extraBit == 0: value = rawBits (no adjustment)
  - If extraBit == 1: value = rawBits + threshold - lowThreshold

**WRONG**: `combined = rawBits * 2 + extraBit` (puts rawBits in HIGH position).
The reference `FSE_readNCount_body` uses `bitStream & (threshold-1)` for the
short path and `bitStream & (2*threshold-1)` for the long path, with
`if (count >= threshold) count -= max` — which is LSB-first ordering.

### Phase 2: Position Stepping (`buildFseTable`)

```
step = (tableSize >> 1) + (tableSize >> 3) + 3
```

Three passes through the table:
1. Place -1 probability symbols at the **end** of the table
2. Distribute remaining symbols using the stepping algorithm, skipping occupied positions
3. Compute `numBits` and `newState` for each cell based on symbol frequency

**Important**: The stepping algorithm only produces coprime steps for
`tableSize >= 32`. Smaller tables may need special handling.

### buildFseTable State Assignment

Use the reference formula for computing `numBits` and `newState`:
```
nextState = count + stateIdx
numBits = accuracyLog - log2(nextState)
newState = (nextState << numBits) - tableSize
```
This is simpler than the doubleCells/highBit approach and matches the reference.

### Phase 3: Symbol Decoding (`decodeFseSymbolsAll`)

**Two interleaved states** (matching `FSE_decompress1X`):
1. Initialize state1 by reading `accuracyLog` bits, then state2
2. Loop: decode state1 (lookup, emit, read bits, update), then state2
3. Termination is **overflow-based**: when `totalBitsRemaining < cell.numBits`,
   emit the other state's symbol and break. Do NOT break on `br.isFinished`.
4. The `BackwardBitReader` needs `totalBitsRemaining` to detect this condition.

**WRONG**: Single-state decoding or breaking when the bitstream is "finished".
The reference continues reading until an overflow condition, then emits one
final symbol from the alternate state.

## Sequence Execution (Zstd's LZ77 Equivalent)

Zstd sequences are `(literalLength, matchLength, offset)` triples. The
execution engine (`executeSequences`) is Zstd's equivalent of DEFLATE's
`resolveLZ77`/`copyLoop`.

### Repeat Offset History

Zstd maintains a 3-entry offset history `[off1, off2, off3]`. Raw offset
values 1-3 are **repeat offset codes**, not actual offsets:

| `literalLength > 0` | Code 1 | Code 2 | Code 3 |
|---------------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Yes (normal) | `history[0]` (no update) | `history[1]` (rotate) | `history[2]` (rotate) |
| No (shifted) | `history[1]` (rotate) | `history[2]` (rotate) | `history[0] - 1` (replace) |

Raw offset values >= 4 are actual offsets (value - 3).

### Overlapping Match Copy

`copyMatch` must handle the case where `matchLength > offset` (the match
overlaps with bytes being produced). Copy byte-by-byte from the back:

```lean
for i in [:length] do
  let srcIdx := buf.size - offset
  buf := buf.push buf[srcIdx]!
```

This naturally handles overlap because `buf.size` grows with each push.

## Extra Bits Tables (RFC 8878 §3.1.1.3.2.1)

Literal lengths and match lengths use baseline + extra bits encoding.
Tables are defined as constant arrays (`litLenExtraBits`, `matchLenExtraBits`)
following RFC 8878 Table 15 and Table 17.

`parseSequencesHeader` returns `(numSeq, compressionModes, posAfterHeader)`.
When `numSeq == 0`, modes default to `predefined`. The compression modes
are needed by `resolveSequenceFseTables` to construct FSE decode tables.

## Huffman Tree Descriptor

**CRITICAL: Follow the reference implementation, not the RFC text.**
The RFC 8878 §4.2.1 table describes headerByte < 128 as direct and >= 128
as FSE-compressed. The **actual reference zstd implementation** does the
opposite: headerByte >= 128 means direct (numWeights = headerByte - 127),
headerByte < 128 means FSE-compressed (compressedSize = headerByte).
Always match the implementation for interoperability.

Two modes for Huffman weight tables:
- **Direct representation** (headerByte >= 128): numWeights = headerByte - 127,
  weights packed as 4-bit nibbles (high nibble first). The function takes
  `numWeights` (symbol count), NOT `numWeightBytes` (byte count).
  Bytes consumed = `ceil(numWeights / 2)`.
- **FSE-compressed** (headerByte < 128, headerByte > 0): compressedSize = headerByte bytes

For the flat lookup table, use `Array.replicate (1 <<< maxBits) default`
and fill entries. Trim trailing zero weights from packed representation
for odd symbol counts.

## Implementation Idioms

### `Id.run do` for Pure Mutable State

For mutable accumulators in non-monadic contexts (used in XXH64 `processRemaining`),
`Id.run do` with `let mut` avoids wrapping in `IO`/`Except` when no errors are possible.

### `Inhabited` Instead of `Repr` for ByteArray-Containing Structs

`ByteArray` does not derive `Repr`. Structs containing it must `deriving Inhabited`,
NOT `Repr` (e.g. `BackwardBitReader`).

### Inductive Types for Fixed Enumerations

Use inductives, not numeric encoding, for block types and the RFC 8878 2-bit
compression modes — gives match exhaustiveness, prevents invalid values propagating:

```lean
inductive ZstdBlockType where | raw | rle | compressed | reserved
  deriving Repr, BEq
inductive SequenceCompressionMode where | predefined | rle | fseCompressed | repeat
  deriving Repr, BEq
```

`repeat` is a tactic keyword, so pattern matching on `SequenceCompressionMode.repeat`
must escape it with guillemets — `| «repeat» =>`, not `| repeat =>` (the latter is
parsed as the tactic and errors with `unexpected token 'repeat'`). Same applies to any
constructor whose name clashes with a keyword (`do`, `return`, `match`, `let`, ...).

### Error Messages with RFC Section References

Include RFC section numbers in error messages for debugging:

```lean
throw s!"Zstd: accuracy log {accuracyLog} exceeds maximum {maxAccLog}"
throw "Zstd: compressed literals not yet supported"  -- RFC 8878 §3.1.1.3.1
```

## Testing Patterns

### Sequential Test Numbering

Tests in `ZipTest/ZstdFrame.lean` are numbered sequentially (test1,
test2, ... test73+). Continue the sequence when adding new tests.

### FFI Behavior Variability

FFI-compressed data may use compressed blocks even for simple/constant
input. Tests must accept multiple error messages:

```lean
-- Accept either success or "compressed blocks not yet implemented"
match result with
| .ok data => assert (data == expected)
| .error msg => assert (msg.containsSubstr "compressed blocks" || msg.containsSubstr "sequence decoding")
```

### Test With Hardcoded Data

FSE and sequence execution can be tested independently with hardcoded
inputs — no need to wire up the full compression pipeline:

```lean
-- Test sequence execution with known sequences
let seqs := #[{ literalLength := 4, matchLength := 3, offset := 5 }]
let result := executeSequences literals seqs history
```

### Test Vectors from Reference Implementations

For hash functions (XXH64), compute test vectors independently via a
reference implementation (e.g., Python's `xxhash` package) rather than
depending on FFI round-trips.
