# PR Repair Flow for Pod Repair Agents

`/repair` sessions work on PRs, not feature issues. The job is to salvage
unhealthy PRs (merge conflicts, failed CI, stuck CI) or close them cleanly
when salvage is not worth doing.

## Core Principle: Fix or Abandon

Repair sessions have exactly two terminal outcomes:

1. **Salvaged** — you pushed a green PR and called `coordination mark-pr-salvaged`.
2. **Abandoned** — you called `coordination close-pr-unsalvageable` after a
   bounded number of failed attempts. This removes `has-pr` from the linked
   issue and adds `replan`, so a fresh plan can be produced.

**Repair sessions do not author `directive` issues.** The `directive`
label flows top-down from the project owner; it is not a place agents
escalate to. Complex conflicts become re-implementations via `replan`,
not human tickets. If verification keeps failing, abandon.

## Coordination Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `coordination list-pr-repair` | Read-only list of PRs needing repair, priority-ordered (`conflict` > `failed` > `stuck`). No label writes. |
| `coordination claim-pr-repair N` | Adds `repair-claimed` label + comment, races detected via a short re-read. Fails if already claimed or another session won the race. |
| `coordination mark-pr-salvaged N` | Clears `repair-claimed`, comments salvage summary. Call after a successful push. |
| `coordination close-pr-unsalvageable N "reason"` | Closes PR, adds `unsalvageable`, removes `has-pr` on linked issue, adds `replan`. |

PR repair claims live in a namespace distinct from issue claims. Pod's
housekeeping loop runs `check_dead_pr_claimed_prs` every 10 minutes to
release claims whose owning session has died.

## Step 1: Claim a PR

```
coordination list-pr-repair
```

Pick the top line (priority order is conflict > failed > stuck). Parse the
PR number out of `#<num> [<reason>] <title>` and claim it:

```
coordination claim-pr-repair <pr-number>
```

If the claim output says the PR is already `repair-claimed` or you lost
the race, move to the next candidate. If all candidates are claimed,
exit — another dispatch will handle the work later.

## Step 2: Check Out the PR Branch

```bash
gh pr checkout <pr-number>
```

Do **not** create a new branch. You are working on the existing PR's head
branch. The PR will be updated by force-push when you're done.

## Step 3: Diagnose

Look at one thing at a time, in this order:

1. `gh pr view <N> --json mergeable,statusCheckRollup,headRefName,baseRefName`
2. If `mergeable == "CONFLICTING"`: `git fetch origin && git merge origin/<base>`
   (or rebase) to surface the conflicting files.
3. If any check conclusion is `FAILURE`: `gh pr checks <N>` then read the
   failing job's log via `gh run view --log-failed`.
4. If "stuck": the CI suite has been running past the configured threshold.
   Usually this means a worker is hung or a runner was lost. Re-running
   from a fresh commit (`git commit --allow-empty -m "kick CI"`) is a
   reasonable first fix.

## Step 4: Apply the Minimal Fix

- **Merge conflicts**: resolve and commit. Prefer the cleaner of `merge` or
  `rebase` — both produce the same end state but `merge` preserves the
  original commits and is less fiddly if history is messy.
- **Failing CI**: make the smallest change that makes the test pass. Do
  **not** expand scope to refactoring or unrelated cleanup — that belongs
  in separate issues.
- **Stuck CI**: empty commit to trigger a re-run is usually enough. If it
  sticks again, that's a signal to abandon.

## Step 5: Verify

Run the project's own verification — the same build/test flow a `/feature`
session would run before opening a PR. See the project's top-level
`CLAUDE.md` for the exact commands.

**Verification is the arbiter.** Do not push until it passes locally.

## Step 6: Push or Abandon

**If verification passes:**
```bash
git push --force-with-lease
coordination mark-pr-salvaged <pr-number>
```
Auto-merge (already set by `coordination create-pr`) will squash-merge the
PR once the remote CI reports green. Exit the session.

**If verification fails after at most 3 fix → verify cycles:**
```
coordination close-pr-unsalvageable <pr-number> "<reason>"
```
Valid reasons to abandon:
- verification keeps failing despite targeted fixes
- the branch is so stale that redoing the work is cheaper than conflict surgery
- the implementation direction is wrong or has been superseded by other merged work
- CI repair would require effectively reimplementing the feature from scratch

Be specific in the reason — it goes on the closing comment and on the
linked issue, and a future planner will read it when producing a replan.

## Step 7: Exit

Don't poll CI. Don't wait for auto-merge. The session ends once you've
either marked salvaged or closed unsalvageable.

## Labels You'll See

- `repair-claimed` — set by `claim-pr-repair`, cleared by `mark-pr-salvaged`
  / `close-pr-unsalvageable`, or by the housekeeping reconciler if the
  claiming session dies.
- `unsalvageable` — set by `close-pr-unsalvageable` on the PR for
  observability. Not functional.

There is intentionally no `needs-repair` label. Repair candidates are
computed on demand by `list-pr-repair`; a label would drift out of sync.

## What You Will Not Do

- Open new issues (except as part of a `replan` comment if genuinely
  helpful context).
- Author a `directive` to escalate (directives are owner-issued only).
- Keep trying the same fix with minor variations past the 3-cycle budget.
- Fight healthy in-progress CI (the stuck threshold already filters for
  checks past the configured age).
- Modify the project's top-level `.claude/CLAUDE.md` or roadmap files.
