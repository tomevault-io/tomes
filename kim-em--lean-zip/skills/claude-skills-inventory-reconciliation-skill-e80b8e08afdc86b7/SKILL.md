# Inventory Reconciliation (lean-zip)

Patterns for executing `SECURITY_INVENTORY.md` *Recommended
policy* and *Missing work* bullets as individual PRs.

## Anchor-refresh PRs are forbidden (issue #2345)

**Do not create — and do not claim — any issue or PR whose only
output is a line-number anchor refresh (e.g. *"re-anchor stale
`Zip/Foo.lean:N` to `:M`"*, *"tighten range cite to def-line"*,
*"refresh stale source-line cites"*) in `SECURITY_INVENTORY.md`,
`.claude/skills/**/*.md`, or `plans/**/*.md`.**

Markdown files in this project no longer track source-line
numbers. Citations use stable identifiers (function name,
theorem name, fixture filename, section header) which do not
shift with line edits.

**Worker action**: if you encounter such an issue, post a
comment linking to issue #2345 and run
`coordination skip <N> "anchor-refresh PR forbidden by #2345"`.

**Planner action**: refuse to create such an issue. Do not
generate work whose entire diff is integer changes in markdown
links.

## One bullet per PR (semantic only)

When a PR *executes* a numbered *Recommended policy* item or a
*Missing work* bullet, it lands as its own PR — do not bundle
two unrelated bullets into one PR. This is about preserving the
bullet-to-PR-number 1:1 mapping in `PROGRESS.md`, not about
guarding link-checker warnings (which no longer exist for
line-anchor drift).

**Precedent**: Rec. 1/2/3/4/5 landed as five PRs in the
2026-04-22 audit-completion wave (#1617, #1618, #1623, #1630,
#1631).

## The *Executed — …* past-tense one-liner

When a PR closes a numbered bullet, rewrite that bullet (in
the same PR) from future-tense to past-tense:

- **Before**: `- [ ] Recommend raising native-side default to
  1 GiB to match FFI whole-buffer (Rec. 5).`
- **After**: `- [x] **Rec. 5 executed**: native-side default
  raised to 1 GiB in #1617; see that PR for caller impact.`

Keep the `- [x]` checkbox. Keep the rec. number
(`**Rec. 5 executed**`) so the planner can cross-reference. One
sentence on caller impact with a PR-number link.

## Half-closed two-step

There are two two-step shapes; both keep the inventory honest
during the half-closed window. Pick by what the closing PR is
splitting — a *parameter* (API surface) or a *scaffold* (artefact
shell with a deferred body).

### Parameter variant (parameter-add + default-flip)

Use a *two-step* (parameter-add PR + default-flip PR) when:

- The parameter is *new to a public API* but the existing
  callers are numerous.
- The default flip needs independent caller-impact analysis.
- The param-add touches multiple subsystems but the flip is
  localised.

Use a *one-step* when:

- The parameter has no existing callers (no backwards-compat
  burden).
- The flip's caller impact is trivially bounded.

**Between-step discipline**: during the half-closed window,
the bullet is re-phrased as *"half-closed by #N (parameter
added, default still 0). Flip tracked as #M."* — the
`#M` is the follow-up issue, filed at the same time as the
param-add PR goes up.

**Precedent**: #1610 (half-closed, default `0`) → #1631
(default-flip) was the 2026-04-22 Rec. 2 execution. #1630 is
the counter-example (new param, no callers, one-step).

### Scaffold variant (scaffold + body fill-in)

Use a *two-step* (scaffold PR + body fill-in PR) when:

- The artefact has a host / toolchain prerequisite that not
  every worker host satisfies (e.g. nightly Rust, Linux-only
  sanitizer runtime, GPU, network credentials).
- The skeleton can be **structurally complete** (env-guard +
  usage block + Missing-work forward-pointer) on any host,
  with the body deferred to a host-gated follow-up.
- A load-bearing env-guard is the right way to signal "host
  ineligible" cleanly (exit code distinct from "skeleton not
  yet implemented" — see PR #2383's two disjoint exit-2 vs
  exit-1 diagnostics).

Use a *one-step* when:

- The recipe body is self-contained and runnable on the worker
  host minting the PR.
- No host-gating is needed.

**Between-step discipline**: during the half-closed window:

- The *Missing work* bullet is **edited in place** with a
  forward-pointer to the new artefact (NOT flipped to *Recent
  wins* yet — the body is still TODO). The `- [ ]` checkbox
  stays unchecked.
- A sibling *Current local guardrails* bullet records the
  half-state with a *"scaffolded but not yet executed"*
  qualifier so a future reader of either bullet can tell that
  the work is *partially executed*.
- The body fill-in is tracked as a separate `agent-plan`
  `feature` issue, filed at the same time as the scaffold PR
  goes up (or by the paired-review of the scaffold PR,
  whichever comes first).
- The follow-up issue carries a host-gating preamble naming
  the toolchain prerequisite and the macOS-style `coordination
  skip` pattern from #2366 / #2369, so worker hosts that
  cannot satisfy the prerequisite release the claim cleanly
  without churning the queue.

**Precedent**: PR #2383 (scaffold —
`scripts/sanitize-rust-ffi.sh` skeleton + Sanitizer recipe
inventory paragraph) → issue #2392 (body fill-in) is the
2026-04-29 Track E miniz_oxide TCB execution. The parameter
variant (#1610 → #1631) remains canonical for *parameter*
splits; this variant is for *artefact-shell* splits and
lives alongside it.

## Single author per wave

If two inventory-reconciliation bullets are claimed
concurrently, the second-to-merge pays rebase cost on
`SECURITY_INVENTORY.md`. Planner should throttle to ≤ 2
*edits-inventory* concurrent (per the #1600 meditate's §7
heuristic) and prefer *sequential* bullets over parallel ones.

## Terminal-closure tightening cadence

When a *Recent wins* bullet covers a per-slot fixture family with a
shared guard (e.g. the post-#1928 UStar interior-NUL family — five
slots `name`/`linkname`/`prefix`/`uname`/`gname`, all under the
same `containsNul` reject), each per-slot landing **rewrites the
same bullet's residual-coverage carve-out**, shrinking the
residual-statement by exactly one slot — keeping the bullet honest
as the family closes.

**Per-step shape**: each PR in the wave touches exactly one bullet
in `SECURITY_INVENTORY.md` *Recent wins* — the bullet for the
shared guard. The PR's `SECURITY_INVENTORY.md` diff is one
carve-out paragraph rewrite (no new bullet, no row reorder), with
the carve-out's slot list shrinking by one entry. The new entry
in *Recent wins* (the per-slot fixture itself) goes elsewhere in
the file (typically the per-format inventory rows), not as a new
bullet — the bullet is the *family* anchor, not the per-slot
anchor.

**Closure-of-sub-arm vs terminal-closure-of-family**: the cadence
distinguishes two carve-out endings.

- **Closure of a sub-arm** leaves the bullet's carve-out paragraph
  in *partial* form, naming the still-open arm. Example phrasing:
  *"… filesystem-reaching arm fully closed (3/3); defense-in-depth
  arm pending (uname/gname)."* The bullet still acknowledges
  residual work.
- **Terminal closure of the whole family** rewrites the carve-out
  to a *terminal-closure form*: *"fully closed N/N — no more
  sibling per-slot fixtures expected"* (or equivalent). The
  bullet stops promising future tightenings. After terminal
  closure, future per-slot work on the same guard would be a
  *different family* (different guard, different bullet), not a
  6th tightening of this one.

**5-step precedent (post-#1928 UStar interior-NUL wave, terminal)**:

1. [#1880](https://github.com/kim-em/lean-zip/pull/1880) — slot
   `name`; carve-out introduced ("4 of 5 slots remain to land as
   sibling per-slot fixtures").
2. [#1934](https://github.com/kim-em/lean-zip/pull/1934) — slot
   `linkname`; carve-out shrunk to "3 of 5 remain
   (prefix/uname/gname)".
3. [#1937](https://github.com/kim-em/lean-zip/pull/1937) — slot
   `prefix`; carve-out shrunk to "filesystem-reaching arm fully
   closed (3/3); defense-in-depth arm pending (uname/gname)".
4. [#1944](https://github.com/kim-em/lean-zip/pull/1944) — slot
   `uname`; carve-out shrunk to "4/5; gname remaining" (sub-arm
   not fully closed yet).
5. [#1957](https://github.com/kim-em/lean-zip/pull/1957) — slot
   `gname`; carve-out **rewritten to terminal-closure form**
   ("fully closed 5/5 — no more sibling per-slot fixtures
   expected").

Step 3 is a *closure of a sub-arm* (filesystem-reaching arm); step
5 is the *terminal closure of the family*. The two phrasings are
not interchangeable — using terminal-closure phrasing at step 3
would mis-promise that no defense-in-depth siblings are coming;
using sub-arm phrasing at step 5 would falsely keep the bullet
open.

**When the cadence is appropriate**:

- The bullet covers a **per-slot fixture family with a shared
  guard** (all slots throw the same error wording family,
  differing only in slot-name suffix), and
- The fixture wave proceeds **one slot per PR** (per the
  *one-bullet-per-PR* cadence above), and
- The **slot count is known up front** (so terminal closure has a
  well-defined endpoint).

**When it is not**:

- One-shot bookkeeping PRs (placeholder substitutions,
  PR-number sweeps) — these touch the inventory but
  do not tighten a carve-out.
- Paired-review entries — these record observations on a landed
  PR; they do not modify the carve-out.
- Defense-in-depth extensions to a *different* guard family — a
  new family gets its own bullet, not a 6th tightening of the
  closed one.

## Per-slot fixture-naming asymmetry

Per-slot fixtures in a family with a shared guard come in two
flavours, distinguished by **whether the slot smuggles into its
own field or into the path slot**. The fixture-name suffix
encodes the distinction.

**Filesystem-reaching arm — single-`name` suffix**: the slot's
value transforms into the path before the guard fires (e.g. the
UStar `prefix` slot is concatenated with `name` by `splitPath`
before the path-validation guard runs). The fixture name uses a
**single** `name` suffix because the smuggled NUL byte ultimately
lands in the *path* slot:

    ustar-<slot>-nul-in-name.tar

The slot identifier names the writer-side smuggle vector; the
`-in-name` half names the post-transform smuggle target.

**Defense-in-depth arm — doubled-`SLOT` suffix**: the slot's value
is written verbatim to its own header field with no path
transform (e.g. UStar `uname` and `gname` are owner-metadata
fields that never reach the filesystem path). The fixture name
uses a **doubled** slot suffix because the smuggled NUL byte
lands directly in the slot's own field:

    ustar-<slot>-nul-in-<slot>.tar

The slot identifier names *both* the writer-side smuggle vector
and the smuggle target — they are the same field.

**5-slot precedent (post-#1928 UStar interior-NUL family)**:

| Slot       | Arm                  | Fixture filename                  |
|------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `name`     | filesystem-reaching  | `ustar-name-nul-in-name.tar`      |
| `linkname` | filesystem-reaching  | `ustar-linkname-nul-in-name.tar`  |
| `prefix`   | filesystem-reaching  | `ustar-prefix-nul-in-name.tar`    |
| `uname`    | defense-in-depth     | `ustar-uname-nul-in-uname.tar`    |
| `gname`    | defense-in-depth     | `ustar-gname-nul-in-gname.tar`    |

The `name` slot is the degenerate filesystem-reaching case where
slot and target collide — the fixture is `ustar-name-nul-in-name.tar`
because both the writer-side vector and the smuggle target are
literally the `name` field, but the *arm* is filesystem-reaching
(the field reaches the filesystem path).

**Smuggle-target invariant**: the suffix encodes the field that
**actually receives** the smuggled NUL byte in the on-disk
header — the attack surface, not just the slot name.

Cross-reference: `malformed-fixture-builder` covers the
*builder-script* side of the same asymmetry — the `pathOverride`
hook (filesystem-reaching arm) versus the verbatim-write pattern
with no override (defense-in-depth arm).

Origin: paired-review #1963 §E.8.e and §E.8.f flagged both
observations after the post-#1928 wave's terminal closure.

## Scope — what this skill does not cover

- Does not cover *new* top-level inventory sections (that's a
  planner-design call, not a reconciliation shape).
- Does not cover the prose of the docstring changes themselves —
  those follow the #1573 template, documented in
  `error-wording-catalogue`.
