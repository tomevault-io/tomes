description: Use when executing a summarize-wave PR — covers the post-issue-creation tail deferral pattern (PRs that land between the planner's issue creation and the wave block's submission stay out of wave scope and roll into the next wave). Sibling skill to `agent-worker-flow` (which covers the generic claim/branch/verify/publish lifecycle) and `inventory-reconciliation` (which shares the issue-body-as-source-of-truth invariant via its *Half-closed two-step* section).

# Summarize Flow (lean-zip)

Patterns specific to the *summarize* worker session — i.e. the
PR that appends a wave block to `PROGRESS.md` for a defined
range of merged PRs.

The generic claim/branch/verify/publish lifecycle lives in
[`agent-worker-flow`](../agent-worker-flow/SKILL.md). This file
captures only the patterns that are summarize-specific because
the issue body enumerates a *fixed PR list* — a contract shape
no other worker session has.

## Post-issue-creation tail deferral

**Rule**: PRs that land **between the planner's issue-creation
timestamp and the wave-block PR's submission timestamp** are
**out of wave scope**. The wave block stays faithful to the
issue body's deliverables enumeration; tail PRs are flagged in
a *"What remains (for the next summarize)"* sub-section and
queued for the next wave block.

**Why — issue-body-as-source-of-truth invariant**: the issue
body is the contract between planner and summarize-worker. Its
deliverables enumeration fixes both the wave's PR list and its
title's PR-count number. Silently absorbing tail PRs breaks
that contract: the audit trail becomes non-reproducible (a
reader cannot tell from the issue alone which PRs the wave
covers) and the title's count drifts from the body. (The
cross-skill analogue is inventory-reconciliation's
[*Half-closed two-step*](../inventory-reconciliation/SKILL.md).)

**Mechanism** — the wave block should:

- close the enumerated PR list at the tail of the body's
  enumeration **as written**, not the tail of `git log` at
  PR-submission time;
- call out each tail PR by number with a rationale (typically
  *"queued-at-wave-close cleanup landed after issue creation"*
  or *"meditate skill update landed after issue creation"*) in
  the *"What remains (for the next summarize)"* paragraph;
- leave the tail PRs' wave assignment to the next planner,
  who absorbs them at the start of the next wave's enumeration.

**Boundary**: summarize-only. Feature/review/repair/meditate
issues have single-PR scope and no wave aggregation, so there
is no tail to defer; their analogous failure mode (unrelated
changes in a single-issue PR) is the PR-scope rule in
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

## Worked precedent — post-#1931 wave (issue #1964 → PR #1971 → PR #1990)

The pattern was first explicitly applied at the boundary
between the post-#1931 and post-#1971 waves on 2026-04-25:

- **Issue [#1964](https://github.com/kim-em/lean-zip/issues/1964)**
  was created at **2026-04-25T07:38:48Z**. Its body enumerated
  15 PRs (the 1932–1963 inclusive range, plus the post-#1904
  carryover paired-review #1932).
- **PRs [#1967](https://github.com/kim-em/lean-zip/pull/1967),
  [#1968](https://github.com/kim-em/lean-zip/pull/1968),
  [#1969](https://github.com/kim-em/lean-zip/pull/1969)**
  merged at **07:45:32Z, 07:50:37Z, 08:07:51Z** respectively
  — all between issue creation (07:38Z) and the wave PR's
  submission. Two were queued-at-wave-close cleanups (#1967 a
  test-list registration follow-up to PR #1865; #1968 a
  placeholder-PR substitution for the post-#1957 wave); one
  (#1969) was a meditate skill update.
- **PR [#1971](https://github.com/kim-em/lean-zip/pull/1971)**
  was submitted at **08:23:34Z** and merged at 08:24:42Z. Its
  wave block kept the 15-PR enumeration as written in the
  issue body and explicitly **deferred** #1967 / #1968 /
  #1969 to the next wave, with the rationale recorded at
  [`progress/20260425T082152Z_1f65eccf-summarize-post-1931.md`](/home/kim/lean-zip/progress/20260425T082152Z_1f65eccf-summarize-post-1931.md).
- **PR [#1990](https://github.com/kim-em/lean-zip/pull/1990)**
  (next wave, post-#1971) absorbed the three tail PRs at the
  start of its 11-PR enumeration. The wave-count audit-trail
  is fully reproducible from the two waves' issue bodies plus
  this deferral note.

## Wave-block paragraph templates

When deferring tail PRs, the wave block's *"What remains (for
the next summarize)"* paragraph should follow this template:

> **Post-issue-creation tail** (out of wave scope): PRs #N1,
> #N2, #N3 landed at HH:MMZ–HH:MMZ, after the issue was
> created at HH:MMZ. The wave block calls these out as
> [one-line per-PR rationale] but defers them to the next
> wave block.

The next wave's issue body should absorb the deferred tail at
the start of its enumeration, e.g.:

> *Tail-deferred from prior wave (PRs #N1, #N2, #N3 — landed
> 07:45–08:08Z, deferred by PR #M per
> `progress/.../...md` (search for "tail-deferred" header)).*

Both halves of the deferral are PR-numbered and timestamped,
so the audit trail closes without any silent scope expansion.

## When the cadence is appropriate

Apply post-issue-creation tail deferral when **all** of:

- the issue body enumerates a fixed PR list (every summarize
  issue does), and
- one or more PRs merge to master after issue creation but
  before the wave block PR is submitted, and
- the new PRs would, if absorbed, change the wave's PR-count
  number or its enumeration shape.

PRs already in the issue body's enumeration (e.g. an in-flight
PR the issue lists as expected) are not "tail" PRs, just
late-merging in-scope PRs — they belong in the wave. The
deferral pattern applies only to PRs the issue body did
**not** anticipate.

## Cross-references

- [`agent-worker-flow`](../agent-worker-flow/SKILL.md) — the
  generic claim/branch/verify/publish lifecycle that wraps
  every summarize session. Read first.
- [`inventory-reconciliation`](../inventory-reconciliation/SKILL.md)
  — *Half-closed two-step* section; same
  issue-body-as-source-of-truth invariant.

## Scope — what this skill does not cover

- Does not cover the wave block's *content* shape (PR
  enumeration sub-sections, family-closure tables,
  quality-metrics-at-end-of-wave block) — those follow the
  per-wave precedent of the prior `PROGRESS.md` block being
  appended to.
- Does not cover the *meditate* worker's reflective skill
  updates, which can land at any time and are separately
  enumerated in summarize waves as their own sub-section.
