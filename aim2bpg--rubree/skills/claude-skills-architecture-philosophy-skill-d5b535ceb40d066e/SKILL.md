# Architecture Philosophy

This is not a generic Rails pattern — it is a direction this project reached on purpose, through
review and iteration. If you are about to suggest `app/services/` or `app/forms/` because that is
the common pattern in Rails tutorials and most training data, **stop and read this first**. It
describes the considered, forward direction for this project — not just a snapshot of its history.

## Put domain logic in ActiveModel-based models, in `app/models`

**The rule**: when you need an object that is not backed by a database table — a calculation, a
coordinator that pulls data from several sources, an input object for a multi-step form — write a
plain Ruby class that includes `ActiveModel::Model`, give it `attr_accessor`/`validates` like any
other Rails model, and place it in `app/models/` (namespaced under a related domain class where
one exists). This is what every non-AR domain object in Rubree already looks like:

```ruby
# ✅ app/models/regular_expression/substitution.rb — a PORO that behaves like a Rails model
class RegularExpression
  class Substitution
    include ActiveModel::Model

    attr_accessor :regular_expression, :test_string, :substitution_string
    attr_reader :substitution_result

    validates :regular_expression, presence: true
    validates :test_string, presence: true
    validate :validate_capture_references

    def initialize(regular_expression:, test_string:, substitution_string:)
      @regular_expression = regular_expression
      # ...
      run_substitution if @regexp && !substitution_string.nil?
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby
# ❌ what this would look like as a "service object" — a separate concern, a separate
# directory, a separate convention for the team to remember and keep aligned on
class Services::SubstitutionService
  def initialize(regular_expression, test_string, substitution_string)
    # ... no validations, no ActiveModel::Errors, no shared Rails idiom — reinvents
    # what ActiveModel already gives a model for free
  end

  def call
    # ...
  end
end
```

**Do not** create `app/services/` or `app/forms/` directories for new code. Both ideas are
already covered by the same technique:

- A "service object" is, in most cases, logic that fits directly on (or next to) an
  ActiveModel-based model — Rails already gives you validations, callbacks, and attributes there
- A "form object" *is* an ActiveModel-based PORO by definition — see
  [speakerdeck.com/expajp/an-introduction-to-formobject](https://speakerdeck.com/expajp/an-introduction-to-formobject):
  it is defined as "a Ruby object not backed by a database table, built by including
  `ActiveModel::Model`". There is no separate pattern to reach for; `app/models` is already where
  it belongs

**Why this is the direction, not just a habit it fell into**: Rubree used to have both
`app/services` and `app/forms`. During an external code review (Oct 2025), the reviewer
pointed out that ActiveModel-based models conventionally live in `app/models` — citing
[Rails Guides → Active Model Basics](https://railsguides.jp/active_model_basics.html) — and that
most of the `app/services` logic could be modeled the same way. The maintainer then consolidated
everything into `app/models`; that consolidation *is* the current architecture
(`RegularExpression`, `RegularExpression::RailroadDiagram`, `RegularExpression::Substitution`,
and so on).

This also lines up with what experienced Rails developers have converged on after years of
leaning on service objects — see
[joker1007, "今改めてServiceクラスについて考える"](https://speakerdeck.com/joker1007/jin-gai-meteservicekurasunituitekao-eru-arurailskai-fa-zhe-no10nian):
his conclusion, after a decade of recommending service classes, was that the difficulty of
keeping a whole team aligned on "where logic should live" rarely pays for itself — and that
leaning on `ActiveRecord`/`ActiveModel` plus a clear domain model gets further with less
overhead.

## Name classes after what they are, not what they do

```ruby
# ✅ nouns — what the object is (the actual classes in app/models/regular_expression/)
RegularExpression::RailroadDiagram
RegularExpression::Substitution
RegularExpression::Example
RegularExpression::Reference

# ❌ verb-shaped — what the object does; this is the shape service-object naming pulls toward
RegularExpression::BuildRailroadDiagram
RegularExpression::GenerateExample
RegularExpression::PerformSubstitution
```

This came directly out of review feedback on this project. Noun names keep a class's
responsibility legible at a glance, and steer away from the "do-something" naming that
service-object thinking tends to produce.

## When splitting a class up, optimize for readability, not file count

`RailroadDiagram` was refactored into modules with its case-when label logic grouped per
`Regexp::Expression` class — but the maintainer deliberately stopped there after trying to go
further:

> 一時、さらにクラス・ファイルを細分化したりと試行錯誤してみましたが、逆に構造が断片的となって
> 処理を追うのが大変になりそうな気がしましたので、このくらいの粒度でベタに case-when の処理が
> 並んでいてもいいのかな
>
> ("I experimented with splitting it into even more classes and files, but that left the
> structure feeling fragmented and harder to follow — so I think it's fine to leave a flat
> case-when at roughly this grain.")

Treat that as the working default: a few well-named, slightly larger modules beat many small ones
if the split makes the flow harder to trace.

## Make test quality visible, not just enforced

Coverage is visualized through octocov (see the `testing-guidelines` skill) because — in the
maintainer's words — "without seeing coverage, it was hard to tell whether the tests were
actually good" (整備にあたっては、カバレッジを意識しなければ良し悪しがよく分かりませんでした).
The percentage is not the point; the point is giving a future reader — human or AI — a way to
*see* whether the suite actually exercises the paths that matter.

## Use modules for static lookups, classes for stateful domain objects

Within `app/models/regular_expression/`, there are two distinct shapes of object:

```ruby
# ✅ module_function — no instance state; pure lookup or data mapping
#    (Example, Reference, RailroadDiagramBuilder)
class RegularExpression
  module Example
    module_function

    def categories   # reads i18n YAML, returns a hash — no state to hold
      ...
    end
  end
end

# ✅ class + include ActiveModel::Model — holds a result, runs validations
#    (Substitution, RubyCode, RailroadDiagram)
class RegularExpression
  class RailroadDiagram
    include ActiveModel::Model
    attr_reader :error_message
    validate :check_for_lazy_or_possessive_quantifiers

    def generate   # produces a result stored on self
      ...
    end
  end
end
```

The rule: reach for `module_function` when the object is a pure lookup or transform with no
per-request state. Reach for a class with `include ActiveModel::Model` when the object holds a
result (`attr_reader :substitution_result`), runs validations, or has a lifecycle tied to a
request. Don't flip the choice just because a module grows large — size alone is not the signal.

## A note for Claude specifically

An AI agent will, on average, suggest the generic Rails pattern — service objects, form objects
as separate concerns — because that is what most training data favors. That is a pull toward the
*statistically common* answer, not necessarily the *right* one for this project. This document
exists so that pull does not quietly bring `app/services`/`app/forms` back over time. If you find
yourself about to propose one, re-read the first section before you do.

## Review checklist

When reviewing a PR or diff — whether via `/code-review`, `/code-review --comment`, or a manual
pass — work through these before commenting. They encode the things most likely to drift in a
near-solo project where there is no second human reviewer to catch them.

### Architecture

- [ ] New domain logic lives in `app/models/` as an ActiveModel-based PORO — no `app/services/`
  or `app/forms/` introduced
- [ ] New class names are nouns (`RegularExpression::Foo`), not verb-shaped
  (`PerformFoo`, `FooService`)
- [ ] If a class was split further, the split makes the flow *easier* to trace — not just smaller
  files

### Client-side philosophy

See the `frontend-patterns` skill for the full checklist.

### Tests

See the `testing-guidelines` skill for the full checklist — spec layer choice, description style,
mocking patterns, `data-*` selector rule, and the octocov coverage/ratio/time thresholds.

### Security

See the `ci-cd-pipeline` skill — Brakeman (SAST) and Gitleaks (secret scan) both run on
`pre-commit` and in CI. If either fails locally, fix the root cause rather than skipping the hook.
