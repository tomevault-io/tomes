# Frontend Patterns

## Alpine.js vs Stimulus

Both are used in this project. The distinction is what the state represents:

- **Alpine.js** — use for purely client-side state that does not survive a Turbo navigation and
  has no server interaction. In Rubree this covers the `wrap`/`showInvisibles` toggles in the
  results panel (persisted in `localStorage`) and the `show`/`hide` toggle in the Ruby code
  snippet. Alpine initialises inline with `x-data` and reacts without a separate controller file.

- **Stimulus** — use for anything that coordinates with Turbo events, reads the DOM on
  `connect`/`disconnect`, or calls back to the server. In Rubree this covers form submission
  (`regexp-form`), the diagram modal (`diagram-modal`), clipboard copy, permalink generation,
  and the examples panel (`regexp-examples`).

```erb
<%# ✅ Alpine for localStorage-persisted toggle — co-located, no controller file needed %>
<div x-data="{ wrap: localStorage.getItem('wrap') !== 'false',
               init() { this.$watch('wrap', v => localStorage.setItem('wrap', v)) } }">

<%# ✅ Stimulus for Turbo event coordination — needs connect/disconnect lifecycle %>
<form data-controller="regexp-form" data-action="input->regexp-form#submit">
```

Don't reach for Stimulus just because something is interactive — if the state is local and
ephemeral (or only needs `localStorage`), Alpine keeps the logic co-located with the markup.

## Turbo Frame and form submission flow

The entire results area lives inside a single Turbo Frame named `regexp`:

```erb
<%= turbo_frame_tag "regexp" do %>
  <%# match results, diagram, substitution, ruby code — all re-rendered on submit %>
<% end %>
```

The form's `data-turbo-frame="regexp"` directs the response back into that frame on submit, so
only the results panel updates — no full page reload.

**Form submission is debounced:** `regexp-form` controller calls `requestSubmit()` after a
200 ms delay on each keystroke, preventing the WASM runtime from being flooded while typing.

**Loading overlay is delayed 300 ms:** the spinner only appears if the response takes longer
than 300 ms (`regexp_form_controller.js` sets a `setTimeout(..., 300)` before showing the
overlay). Fast WASM responses complete before the timer fires, so there is no spinner flash on
typical inputs. The timeout is cancelled on `turbo:frame-render` for the `regexp` frame.

## ERB whitespace in preformatted output

When a container is styled with `whitespace-pre` or `font-mono`, the `<%= %>` tag must be placed
flush against the opening element's closing `>` with **no intervening newline or space**. ERB
emits any surrounding whitespace verbatim, and `whitespace-pre` renders it as a leading blank
character or extra line in the browser:

```erb
<%# ✅ ERB flush against the opening tag — no leading whitespace in the rendered output %>
<div class="whitespace-pre font-mono ..."><%= regular_expression.substitution_result %></div>

<%# ❌ newline before ERB tag — visible as a leading blank line inside the preformatted box %>
<div class="whitespace-pre font-mono ...">
  <%= regular_expression.substitution_result %>
</div>
```

For the same reason, the match-span highlighting loop in `_match.html.erb` is written as a
single semicolon-separated expression starting immediately after the `>` of the container
`<div>`. Breaking it across lines would inject whitespace before the first highlighted character.
ERB Lint may flag these as "line too long" — this is acceptable for preformatted output blocks.
Do not reformat them.

## Helper methods defined inside ERB templates

`escape_invisibles` — which converts `\n`, `\t`, `\r` to visible symbols like `⏎`, `⇥`, `␍`
— is defined with a bare `def` inside the ERB template rather than in `app/helpers/`. This is
intentional: the function is only needed within the two `<template x-if="showInvisibles">` blocks
of a single partial, and adding it to `ApplicationHelper` would pollute the global helper
namespace for a purely local concern. The inline `def` creates a method in the template's binding
scope.

If `escape_invisibles` ever needs to be shared across multiple partials, move it to
`app/helpers/regular_expressions_helper.rb` at that point.

## SVG output is sanitized — do not bypass it

`RailroadDiagram#diagram_svg` passes the generated SVG through
`ActionController::Base.helpers.sanitize(...)` with an explicit allowlist before returning it.
The result is an `ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer` (html-safe), which is why `<%= diagram_svg %>` in
the view renders without double-escaping.

Do not call `raw(...)` or `.html_safe` on unsanitized SVG. A crafted regex pattern could
otherwise inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript via the SVG output.

```ruby
# ✅ what RailroadDiagram.sanitize_svg does — narrow allowlist, returns SafeBuffer
ActionController::Base.helpers.sanitize(
  raw_svg,
  tags: %w[svg g path rect circle line text style defs title desc],
  attributes: %w[d fill stroke x y cx cy r width height viewBox xmlns class type
                 transform text-anchor font stroke-width rx ry]
)

# ❌ never do this — bypasses XSS protection on user-influenced SVG content
raw(regular_expression.diagram_svg)
```

## Review checklist — frontend

When reviewing a PR or diff that touches the client-side layer:

### Client-side philosophy

- [ ] No server-side dependency introduced — the app remains deployable as a static site to
  GitHub Pages (no runtime external API calls that require a backend, no new server-rendered
  endpoints that break in the WASM context)
- [ ] If gem dependencies or Rails internals changed, verify the WASM build still works
  (`bin/rails wasmify:build` or check the CI Deploy job) — gems that don't compile to WASM will
  silently break the browser app

### Browser compatibility

- [ ] Behavior is Chrome/Edge-only — no assumption that Safari or Firefox will work; new Web APIs
  must be in Chrome stable. (Safari/Firefox fail due to WebAssembly asyncify / Service Worker
  incompatibilities — see README → Browser Compatibility for the full explanation)
