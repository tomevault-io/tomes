# Open Changed Files Review

## Contract

Prereqs:

- `zsh` available on `PATH`.
- Optional: VSCode CLI `code` (missing → script no-ops).
- `$AGENT_HOME/skills/tools/devex/open-changed-files-review/scripts/open-changed-files.zsh` available.

Inputs:

- File paths touched in the current run (preferred).
- Optional: `CODEX_OPEN_CHANGED_FILES_MAX_FILES` to cap opened files.

Outputs:

- Opens the requested files in VSCode (best-effort).
- If VSCode/tool unavailable: silent no-op (still provides a paste-ready command in chat when used manually).

Exit codes:

- `0`: success or no-op
- non-zero: invalid usage or unexpected runtime failure

Failure modes:

- VSCode CLI `code` not installed or not on `PATH`.
- Input paths do not exist (script filters to existing files).

Use this skill when Codex has edited files and you want to immediately open the touched files in Visual Studio Code for human review.

## Inputs

- A list of file paths that were modified/added in this Codex run (preferred; does not require git).

## Workflow

1. Build a de-duplicated list of existing files from the touched paths.
2. Determine the cap:
   - Default: `CODEX_OPEN_CHANGED_FILES_MAX_FILES=50`
   - If there are more files than the cap: open the first N and mention that it was truncated.
3. Prefer running:
   - `$AGENT_HOME/skills/tools/devex/open-changed-files-review/scripts/open-changed-files.zsh --max-files "$max" --workspace-mode pwd -- <files...>`
4. If VSCode CLI `code` (or the tool) is unavailable: silent no-op (exit `0`, no errors), but still print a paste-ready manual command plus
   the file list for the user.

## Paste-ready command template

```zsh
$AGENT_HOME/skills/tools/devex/open-changed-files-review/scripts/open-changed-files.zsh --max-files "${CODEX_OPEN_CHANGED_FILES_MAX_FILES:-50}" --workspace-mode pwd -- <files...>
```
