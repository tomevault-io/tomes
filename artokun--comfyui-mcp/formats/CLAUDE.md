## Usage

Add this to your project's CLAUDE.md to activate this skill:

```
Read and follow the instructions in .claude/skills/comfyui-mcp/SKILL.md
```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:

# Development Notes

## Local Testing with npm link

The developer uses `npm link` so that `npx comfyui-mcp` resolves to the local build at `C:\Users\klutt\code\comfyui-mcp\dist\`.

**DO NOT modify `plugin/.mcp.json`** to point to a local path. It must stay as:
```json
{
  "comfyui": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "comfyui-mcp"]
  }
}
```
This works for both:
- **Public users**: `npx` downloads from npm
- **Developer**: `npm link` makes `npx` resolve to the local build

After code changes: `npm run build` then `/mcp` reconnect in Claude Code.

## Plugin File Sync

The plugin runs from cached copies, not the source tree. After changing files in `plugin/`:
- Cache: `~/.claude/plugins/cache/comfyui-mcp/comfy/0.1.0/`
- Marketplace: `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/comfyui-mcp/plugin/`

Copy changed files to both locations, then restart Claude Code for hooks or `/mcp` for MCP tools.
