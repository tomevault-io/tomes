description: Independent plan execution orchestrator -- User selects execution mode (in-session / subagent / cli), orchestrator controller rule set (11 semantic rules, shared across three modes). cli mode delegates to cli-driven-development; in-session/subagent mode Reads the corresponding upstream skill. Use when this capability is needed.

# OS Executing-Plans

Master orchestrator for executing written plans. Three modes chosen by the user.

## Rules

### Rule: Read Upstream

Resolve upstream based on user-selected mode (resolution priority + unavailability fallback same as [Rule: Read Upstream](../brainstorming/SKILL.md#rule-read-upstream)):
- **in-session** -> resolve `executing-plans` SKILL.md path, Read as baseline (when available)
- **subagent** -> resolve `subagent-driven-development` SKILL.md path, Read as baseline (when available)
- **cli** -> [cli-driven-development](../cli-driven-development/SKILL.md) (Skill-invoke delegation, do not Read upstream)

### Rule: Mode Selection

At startup, use `AskUserQuestion` to let the user choose a mode (in-session | subagent | cli). After selection, call `cdd-session-activate.mjs minimal <session_key> <repo_root> --mode <mode>` to write `pending.mode`.

### Rule: Task Complexity

Classify each task first: touches 1-2 files + mechanical implementation -> **Simple**; 3+ files / cross-module / requires design judgment / user requests thoroughness -> **Complex**. Affects diff scope, test gate, model tier.

### Rule: Confirm Once

spec+plan complete -> cheapest implementer tier; confirm once before first dispatch.

### Rule: Fix Loop

`CHANGES_REQUESTED` -> fix -> scoped review -> repeat until `APPROVED` or **5 rounds** (exceeded -> STOP + escalate).

### Rule: Confirm Seams

Before dispatching a tdd implement worker, the orchestrator confirms test boundaries (seam) with the user in-session, writing the confirmation result `CONFIRMED_SEAMS: <...>` into the task brief. cli mode is fire-and-forget print-mode CLI that cannot block -- `templates/cdd/implement.md` applies non-blocking ("if brief contains `CONFIRMED_SEAMS`, apply it"), seam confirmation is exclusive to the orchestrator layer.

### Rule: Per-Task Review

Per-task review gate: read handoff.json driven (plan_conflicts -> STOP; CHANGES_REQUESTED -> Fix Loop; NEEDS_CONTEXT/unverifiable -> STOP). cli mode worker review runs inside the CLI subprocess; in-session/subagent mode review gate runs in-session. Discipline: see [controller-handoff.md](../../docs/controller-handoff.md) H1-H5.

### Rule: Quality Invariants

1. Test evidence gate (task-N-test-evidence.json)
2. plan_conflicts[] -> human adjudication
3. unverifiable[] non-empty -> BLOCKED
4. handoff NEEDS_CONTEXT -> STOP

### Rule: Orchestrator Checklist

The orchestrator's three-phase loop per plan (shared skeleton across three modes; cli mode differences noted in Per-task parentheses):

**Setup (once):** in-session/subagent -> `sdd-workspace`; cli -> delegate workspace to [cli-driven-development](../cli-driven-development/SKILL.md) (built inside cdd-run.mjs H6 chain). Unified follow-up: ledger -> read plan once -> `plan-constraints.md` -> pre-flight -> todo per task.

**Per-task:** Rule: Task Complexity → Rule: Confirm Once → Rule: Confirm Seams (before tdd implement dispatch) → append `TASK_BASE: <sha>` to brief → execution chain (cli mode shell H6 chain: implement → review → fix per Rule: Fix Loop; in-session/subagent mode in-session implementation + review) → Read `handoff.json` only → Rule: Per-Task Review + Rule: Quality Invariants → `APPROVED` → ledger. cli mode **Never** edits repo deliverables in this session — H6 CLI only。

**Final:** `requesting-code-review` whole-branch in-session -> clean -> `finishing-a-development-branch`.

### Rule: D6 Aggregation

After all tasks APPROVED, aggregate deferred items (grep `deferred` substring, including no-jq fallback line `deferred not enumerated -- jq missing`) -> **present to user** -> **user decision gate** (all defer / name specific ones to fix) -> if fix requested then **bounded final fix wave (one pass)**: one fix agent + scoped re-review.

End semantics:
- re-review clean -> done, handoff `status` stays `APPROVED` (**not rewritten**), ledger keeps complete line (may append a line noting K items fixed)
- new blocker exposed -> still one fix wave, then **unconditionally report to the user** (clean or not) -- **no cross-task fix loop**; remaining items are not silently dropped, report ends
- **round cap 5 applies only to single-task fix loop, not to cross-task final fix wave**

Mode B: user reads ledger after run ends to aggregate deferred; shell side has no extra end-of-run print.

### Rule: Ledger

Only `APPROVED` appends `Task N: complete` to `CDD_LEDGER`.

## Red Flags

- "CLI is available so skip mode selection" -> all three modes must be asked (Rule: Mode Selection)
- "in-session also uses cdd-run.mjs" -> in-session is in-session implementation, no CLI (Rule: Read Upstream)
- "Shove orchestrator decisions into cli-driven-development" -> engine only handles execution (Rule: Read Upstream — cli branch)
