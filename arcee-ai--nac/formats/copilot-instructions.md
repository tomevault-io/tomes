# NAC repository guide

NAC is a Rust coding-agent harness with a React web client. It supports three
immutable session behaviors: the established orchestrator/worker topology, a
persistent direct coding agent with traditional child sessions, and a direct
agent that can launch separate managed orchestrator sessions. Managed-host
deployment is additive and opt-in.

Read the nearest nested `AGENTS.md` before changing a subsystem. This root file
defines repository-wide constraints; nested guides add ownership-specific
rules. Durable architectural decisions live in `docs/architecture/`. Historical
work ledgers and local notebooks are evidence, not a substitute for current code
and tests.

## Dependency direction

Dependencies point inward:

```text
React clients
    -> HTTP/OpenAPI/MCP delivery (nac-server)
        -> focused application services and composition ports
            -> nac-core durable harness       nac-managed product context
                -> shared contracts/infrastructure adapters <-
```

- Domain and application contracts must not depend on Axum, React, provider
  wire types, or deployment wiring.
- `nac-managed` does not depend on `nac-server` or the agent harness. The server
  composes its ports with core/project services.
- Provider, filesystem, database, Git/process, sandbox, and HTTP clients are
  adapters around inward contracts; do not move transport types into domain
  APIs.
- Model-visible tool exposure, authorization, hard safety policy, and the
  already-selected execution backend are separate decisions. Approval never
  changes or escapes the backend.
- Prefer private modules and narrow exports. Add a crate only for a real
  dependency boundary, not to increase crate count.

See [dependency boundaries](docs/architecture/0001-dependency-boundaries.md)
and [generated API contract](docs/architecture/0002-generated-api-contract.md).

## Product and compatibility invariants

- Persisted session behavior is immutable. Preserve the public values
  `orchestrator`, `direct`, and `direct-with-orchestrator`; omitted legacy values
  still default to `orchestrator`.
- Traditional child sessions and managed orchestrators are distinct durable
  topologies. Do not collapse them into worker roles or a new public taxonomy.
- Preserve prompts, defaults, thread/workset behavior, MCP semantics, API
  shapes, configuration values, and supported migrations unless a deliberate
  product decision changes them.
- Durable inbox, goals, transcripts, relationships, leases, recovery,
  cancellation, and completion delivery must remain restart-safe and
  generation-aware.
- Preserve revision-checked atomic mutation, no-follow path handling, retained
  terminal output, cancellation/process-tree cleanup, rich results, event
  emission, and workspace ownership.
- Permission ordering, hard denials, canonical resource binding, remembered
  grant scope, and headless fail-closed behavior are safety contracts. Tool
  visibility is never authorization.
- Local, SSH, and optional Podman are construction-time backend choices.
  Authorization cannot select a different backend or grant sandbox escape.
- Managed credentials and Exa credentials retain exact-value redaction and
  ownership isolation. Managed features remain absent/inert when not enabled.

Read neighboring tests before changing a safety, durability, schema, recovery,
or concurrency seam. Add characterization coverage with the change.

## Repository map

- `crates/nac-core/` — durable harness, model/runtime loop, tools, permissions,
  sessions, persistence, workspace and execution backends.
- `crates/nac-managed/` — harness-independent managed-host bounded context.
- `crates/nac-server/` — application composition plus HTTP/OpenAPI/MCP delivery
  and the `nac-web` binary.
- `crates/nac-server/web/` — React/Vite client and production-embedded E2E.
- `crates/nac-contracts/` — narrow shared domain/port contracts.
- `crates/nac-credential-store/` — hardened private credential persistence.
- `crates/nac-process/` — shared process supervision and cleanup.
- `docker/managed/` — managed image and entrypoint contract.
- `docs/` — user documentation and tracked architecture decisions.
- `scripts/` — release, contract generation, and image checks.

## Commands

In every fresh worktree, run `make setup` before development or verification.
Run it again after either lockfile changes. It fetches the locked Rust dependency
graph, installs the locked web dependency tree, and ensures Playwright Chromium
is available for the production E2E lane. Rust/Cargo and Node/npm are host
prerequisites; the target reports a direct installation hint when either is
missing.

Use locked Cargo commands and targeted checks while iterating:

```sh
make setup
make build
make check
make crate-check CRATE=nac-core
make crate-test CRATE=nac-core
make format-check
make lint
make test
make test-source-size
make ci
make test-durability
make test-assets
make test-e2e
make test-managed-image-contract
```

`make test-managed-image` additionally requires Docker or Podman. Treat missing
container infrastructure as an explicit coverage gap, not a passing result.

## Generated files and single writers

- Rust routes and `utoipa` schemas are the API source of truth.
  `make generate-api-contract` is the sole writer for
  `crates/nac-server/web/openapi.json` and
  `crates/nac-server/web/src/app/types/openapi.generated.ts`. Never edit the
  generated TypeScript by hand; `make test-api-contract` checks drift.
- The web build is the sole writer for committed
  `crates/nac-server/assets/dist/`. Commit source and rebuilt assets together;
  `make test-assets` fails on drift.
- Keep `Cargo.lock` consistent with workspace manifests. Do not hand-edit it.
- `nac-catalog-gen` is the sole writer for
  `crates/nac-core/src/model/catalog/data/catalog.json` and
  `catalog.manifest.json`; see its nested guide before regeneration.

## Change discipline

- Preserve unrelated dirty worktree state. Stage exact paths, inspect staged
  and unstaged diffs, and avoid destructive Git operations.
- Keep production modules around 500 lines where ownership permits. A cohesive
  module over 800 lines needs an ownership explanation in its nearest guide.
  Every tracked human-authored source/configuration/guide file must remain at
  or below 2,000 physical lines (`make test-source-size`). A rare cohesive
  exception may be at most 3,000 lines and must name its durable ownership
  reason in the guard; the current repository has no exceptions. Machine-owned
  generated artifacts and lockfiles use their existing single-writer/drift
  checks instead. Do not game either target with empty wrappers, numbered
  fragments, include-only shards, or one-call indirection.
- Put tests next to their owner, using sibling test modules when inline tests
  obscure production responsibilities.
- Backward-compatible migrations only unless an explicit decision authorizes a
  break. Never rewrite stored identity or public vocabulary incidentally.
- Avoid new dependencies when the standard library or workspace crates are
  adequate. Importing code or changing licenses requires explicit review.

## Reference repositories

External/local harness checkouts may be inspected read-only for behavioral and
architectural ideas. Verify their revision before relying on them. They are not
portable build inputs: never add path dependencies, copy implementations, or
adopt licenses without an explicit dependency/license decision. NAC's code and
settled behavior remain authoritative.
