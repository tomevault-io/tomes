name: elaborate
description: Write implement-ready code into ONE phase of a synthesized plan — read the whole plan plus the real code the phase touches, then emit a code-bearing replacement for that single `## Phase N:` section to .rpiv/artifacts/elaborations/. Single-pass, no subagents, no self-review, no questions. Dispatched once per phase by an elaborate fanout after synthesize; the per-phase elaborations are folded back into the plan by the deterministic `stitch-elaborations` script, and the grade panel judges the stitched plan. Use as a fanout unit, not standalone. Use when this capability is needed.

# Elaborate

You write **implement-ready code into one phase** of a synthesized plan, in isolation, and emit it as a per-phase elaboration doc. One pass. You do **not** redesign the phase, write any other phase's code, or self-review — `synthesize` already reconciled the cross-phase seams and the workflow's grade panel judges the spliced result. You turn one phase's contract-level "what to change" into the actual code to apply.

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` — `<plan-path> Phase N: <title>` (exactly the unit shape a phase fanout dispatches):

- The first token is the path to a plan under `.rpiv/artifacts/plans/`.
- The remainder (`Phase N: <title>`) names the **single** phase to elaborate. Parse `N` from `Phase (\d+)`.

Elaborate **only** that phase. The other phases are owned by sibling lanes — never write their code.

If the plan path is missing or `Phase N` can't be parsed, print an error and stop — it's a dispatch error, not a failing phase.

## Metadata

```!
node "${SKILL_DIR}/../_shared/now.mjs"
echo
node "${SKILL_DIR}/../_shared/git-context.mjs"
```

Copy values verbatim. `<iso>` is the first tab-separated field (use as `date`); ignore the second.

## Steps

1. **Read the plan fully** (no limit/offset). Note its `## Synthesis Notes` (the reconciled seams — conflict resolutions, shared locals, integration order) and locate the `## Phase N:` section you own: its `### Changes` (the files/symbols to touch) and its `### Success Criteria`. Skim the **other** phases' sections too — to know what they own and what interfaces they expose — but never implement them.
2. **Ground in the live code.** For every file the phase's `### Changes` names, Read/Grep the cited `path:line` in the **current** tree. The plan may have been written against a slightly older state — anchor the code you write to what is actually there now (signatures, imports, surrounding style).
3. **Write the code for this phase only.** For each file in the phase's Changes, emit a concrete, paste-ready code block: the full function/section to add, or the exact edit (enough that `implement` applies it without guessing). Match the surrounding code's conventions. Where the phase depends on a sibling phase's symbol, reference it by the shape the plan/Synthesis Notes already fixed — do not redefine it.
4. **Carry the success criteria.** Preserve the phase's `### Success Criteria` (Automated + Manual), tightening a check only if your code makes it more concrete. Do not drop or weaken a criterion.
5. **Resolve ambiguity yourself.** Decide from the plan, the Synthesis Notes, and the real code. This skill is **non-interactive** — if a genuine blocker can't be settled from those inputs, make the most defensible call, record it under `## Notes / Deferred`, and let the grade panel catch a bad call. Do **not** ask the user (N lanes run concurrently).
6. **Write the elaboration doc** (below), `status: ready`. Its filename pairs to the plan so the splice can fold it back deterministically — see Output document.
7. **Print the path**, then a one-line summary: `Phase N elaborated: <k> files, <m> code blocks`.

## Output document

Path: `.rpiv/artifacts/elaborations/<plan-basename>__phase-<N>.md`, where `<plan-basename>` is the plan filename **without** the `.md` extension. Example: for `.rpiv/artifacts/plans/2026-06-24_17-13-09_full-width-boxed-workflow-preview.md`, Phase 2 → `.rpiv/artifacts/elaborations/2026-06-24_17-13-09_full-width-boxed-workflow-preview__phase-2.md`.

The body **must** contain exactly one `## Phase <N>: <title>` section — verbatim heading text matching the plan (same `N`, same title). The `stitch-elaborations` script swaps the plan's `## Phase N:` section for this one, so the heading is the splice anchor: do not rename it or change `N`.

## Phase <N>: <title>

### Changes

#### `path/to/file.ts`
<one line: what and why>
```ts
<implement-ready code — the function/section to add, or the exact edit, grounded in the current file>
```

#### `path/to/other.ts`
<one line>
```ts
<code>
```

### Success Criteria
#### Automated Verification:
- [ ] <command / assertion, carried from the plan>
#### Manual Verification:
- [ ] <check>

## Notes / Deferred
<only if a blocker forced an assumption — otherwise omit this section>
```

## Hard rules

- **One phase only.** Never write code for a file another phase owns; reference its interfaces by the shape `synthesize` already fixed.
- **Implement-ready code, grounded in the current tree.** Read the cited files first; emit code blocks, not prose hand-waving ("handle appropriately", "etc.").
- **Repo-root-relative, verifiable citations.** Every `file:line` your elaboration emits — in prose or in code comments — uses the **repo-root-relative** path (`packages/billing/src/invoice.ts:42`), never a subdirectory-relative form (`src/invoice.ts:42`) or a bare basename, and must be verifiable at the current revision: cite what you actually read; if you can't verify a line number, cite the path alone and omit the `:line`. Your elaboration is spliced into the plan and passes the deterministic `code-cite-check` floor — one unbacked or ambiguous citation fails the gate and buys the whole run a code-fix loop.
- **Body is exactly one `## Phase N: <title>` section** with the verbatim heading — the deterministic splice folds it back by phase number. Don't rename the heading or change `N`.
- **Write the doc, not the code.** You only write your elaboration artifact; reading the codebase to ground the code is required, editing it is out of scope — `implement` applies the code later, after the splice.
- **No subagents. No self-review. No `ask_user_question`.** Decide, record any deferral in Notes, write — the grade panel is the validation.
