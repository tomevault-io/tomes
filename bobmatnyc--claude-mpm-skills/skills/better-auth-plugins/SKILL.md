# Better Auth Plugins

## Goals
- Add server plugins to extend auth features.
- Add client plugins for matching client methods.
- Apply schema changes when plugins add tables.

## Quick start
1. Import the plugin from `better-auth/plugins` and add it to `plugins`.
2. Run migrations (`generate` or `migrate`) when required.
3. Add the client plugin from `better-auth/client/plugins`.

### Example: Two-factor authentication
```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { twoFactor } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [twoFactor()],
});
```

```ts
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
import { twoFactorClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins";

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
  plugins: [twoFactorClient({ twoFactorPage: "/two-factor" })],
});
```

## Migration reminder
Run the CLI when a plugin adds tables:

```bash
npx @better-auth/cli generate
```

```bash
npx @better-auth/cli migrate
```

## Guardrails
- Add server and client plugins together to keep APIs aligned.
- Keep `nextCookies` (if used) last in the server plugin list.
- Review plugin docs for required schema and env variables.
