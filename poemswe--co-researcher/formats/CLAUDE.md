## How to use in Gemini CLI

Gemini automatically discovers these agents when you run it from this directory. You can invoke them by name:

```bash
gemini "Use the literature-review skill to find recent papers on room temperature superconductors"
gemini "Ask the critical-analysis skill to review my methodology in proposal.md"
```

The CLI reads the context from `agents/` and this `GEMINI.md` file automatically.
It also has access to the specialized skills in the `skills/` directory.
