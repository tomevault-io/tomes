# STPA Step 4: Identify Loss Scenarios

## Objective

For each Unsafe Control Action (UCA) identified in Step 3:
1. Trace back through the control structure to find **why** it might occur
2. Identify **causal factors** at each level
3. Develop **recommendations** to prevent or mitigate

## Announce at Start

"I'm using the STPA Step 4 skill to identify loss scenarios. We'll trace each UCA back through the control structure to understand what could cause it."

## Two Types of Scenarios

### Scenario Type 1: Why the UCA occurs

The controller issues an unsafe control action because of:
- **Incorrect process model**: Controller has wrong understanding of system state
- **Inadequate control algorithm**: Logic errors or missing conditions
- **External factors**: Environmental interference, component failures
- **Communication issues**: Commands lost, delayed, or corrupted

### Scenario Type 2: Why the control action is improperly executed

Even if the correct control action is issued:
- **Actuator failure**: The mechanism can't execute the command
- **Delayed execution**: Action happens too late
- **Process doesn't respond**: Physical constraints prevent action
- **Conflicting controls**: Another controller countermands

## Causal Factor Categories

For each UCA, consider these causal categories:

### Controller-Related

1. **Unsafe control algorithm**
   - Missing or incorrect logic
   - Race conditions
   - Unhandled edge cases

2. **Incorrect process model**
   - Wrong assumptions about system state
   - Stale information
   - Missing information
   - Incorrect understanding of physics/behavior

3. **Inadequate feedback**
   - Feedback not received
   - Feedback delayed
   - Feedback incorrect
   - Feedback misinterpreted

### Path-Related

4. **Control action not executed**
   - Command lost in transmission
   - Actuator failure
   - Conflicting commands

5. **Feedback not provided**
   - Sensor failure
   - Communication failure
   - Feedback suppressed

### Process-Related

6. **Process behavior**
   - Unexpected process response
   - External disturbances
   - Component failures within process

## Analysis Process

### For Each High-Priority UCA

**Step A: State the UCA**
```
UCA-X: [Controller] [action context] leading to [H-X]
```

**Step B: Ask "Why might this happen?"**

Walk backward through the control loop:

1. **Why might the controller issue this UCA?**
   - What must the controller believe for this to seem correct?
   - What information might it be missing?
   - What could go wrong with its decision logic?

2. **Why might the controller have wrong information?**
   - How does feedback reach the controller?
   - What could corrupt or delay this feedback?
   - What assumptions does the controller make?

3. **Why might the action not execute correctly?**
   - What could prevent proper execution?
   - What could delay execution?
   - What could cause partial execution?

**Step C: Document each causal pathway**

### Scenario Template

```markdown
### UCA-X: [description]

**Scenario 1: [Brief name]**
[Controller] [reason for issuing UCA] because [root cause].
The controller's process model was incorrect because [specific gap].

**Recommendation:** [Mitigation measure]

**Scenario 2: [Brief name]**
Even though correct command was issued, [reason execution failed] because [root cause].

**Recommendation:** [Mitigation measure]
```

## Example Analysis

### UCA-2: Auth Service issues token when credentials are invalid

**Scenario 1: Credential Check Bypassed**
Auth Service issues token without proper verification because the validation logic contains a short-circuit that skips checks under high load conditions. The controller's algorithm prioritizes availability over security.

**Recommendation:** Remove short-circuit logic; ensure all credential validation is mandatory regardless of load. Add circuit breaker that fails closed (denies access) rather than fails open.

**Scenario 2: Cached Valid Status**
Auth Service issues token because it uses a cached "valid" status from a previous request, not realizing the credentials were revoked. The process model is stale.

**Recommendation:** Implement cache invalidation on credential revocation. Add freshness checks before using cached authentication status.

**Scenario 3: Response Confusion**
Auth Service issues token because response from identity provider was corrupted in transit and misinterpreted as "valid". Communication path has no integrity checking.

**Recommendation:** Add checksum/signature verification on all identity provider responses. Implement retry with fresh request on verification failure.

## Questions to Guide Analysis

For each UCA, work through:

**Q1: What must be true in the controller's model for this UCA to happen?**
(Identify the incorrect belief or assumption)

**Q2: How could the controller's model become incorrect?**
- Feedback never received?
- Feedback received but wrong?
- Feedback received but misinterpreted?
- Process model never updated?

**Q3: What could prevent proper execution of the correct action?**
- Actuator issues?
- Timing problems?
- Interference?

**Q4: What would prevent/detect each scenario?**
(These become your recommendations)

## Recommendation Categories

### Prevention (Eliminate the scenario)
- Design changes to make scenario impossible
- Adding missing feedback paths
- Fixing control algorithm logic

### Detection (Catch it when it happens)
- Monitoring and alerts
- Redundant checks
- Anomaly detection

### Mitigation (Reduce impact when it occurs)
- Fallback behaviors
- Graceful degradation
- Recovery procedures

## Output Template

Record in .sgai/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md:

```markdown
### Step 4: Loss Scenarios

#### UCA-1: [description]

**Scenario 1: [Name]**
[Controller] [behavior] because [cause].
The [aspect] was [incorrect/missing/delayed] because [root cause].

**Recommendation:** [Mitigation]

**Scenario 2: [Name]**
[Description of causal pathway]

**Recommendation:** [Mitigation]

#### UCA-2: [description]

[Repeat for each high-priority UCA]

### Recommendation Summary

| ID | Recommendation | Addresses | Priority |
|----|---------------|-----------|----------|
| R-1 | [recommendation] | UCA-1, UCA-3 | High |
| R-2 | [recommendation] | UCA-2 | Medium |
```

## Completing the STPA Analysis

When all scenarios are documented:

1. **Summarize in GOAL.md:**

```markdown
## STPA Findings
- [X] STPA analysis completed on [date]
- Key hazards identified: [count]
- Unsafe control actions found: [count]
- Loss scenarios analyzed: [count]
- Critical recommendations:
  - R-1: [brief description]
  - R-2: [brief description]
```

2. **Update .sgai/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md** with complete analysis

3. **Set status: "agent-done"** to return control

## Iteration

STPA is iterative. If during Step 4 you discover:
- New hazards → Return to Step 1
- Missing control paths → Return to Step 2
- New UCAs → Return to Step 3

Document any iterations and the insights that triggered them.
