# Code Review

Review one immutable diff against:

- **Standards** — repository instructions and documented coding standards.
- **Spec** — the originating issue, PRD, or acceptance criteria.

## Prepare

1. Pin the requested input. Resolve committed endpoints to SHAs; if staged or working-tree changes are included, capture one patch snapshot. Give every reviewer that same immutable diff. Stop on invalid or empty input.
2. Find the spec from commit references, a user-provided path, or matching files under `docs/`, `specs/`, or `.scratch/`. If none exists, mark the Spec axis unavailable.
3. Find applicable repository instructions and standards such as `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `CODING_STANDARDS.md`.
4. Inventory the complete diff: files, hunks, additions, deletions, renames, and binary files. Never rely on one possibly truncated diff output.

## Review

- Inspect every added, changed, and deleted line in every file, including tests, docs, configuration, migrations, lock/generated files, renames, and binaries. Read surrounding code and call sites where needed.
- Maintain a file-and-hunk checklist against the inventory. Inspect file by file or in smaller batches so output cannot hide lines through truncation. Do not finish with an unchecked line or hunk.
- Report only issues introduced by the diff. A blocker requires evidence of an acceptance, correctness, security, data-loss, compatibility, or explicit required-standard violation. Style preferences, generic code smells, speculative hardening, optional refactors, and unrelated debt are non-blocking advisories.
- For findings, provide severity, `file:line`, the violated spec/rule or invariant, a concrete failure scenario, evidence, and the smallest valid fix. Do not report vague possibilities.
- Return `PASS` or `CHANGES NEEDED`, then blockers, advisories, and coverage totals. `PASS` means zero blockers, not zero possible improvements.

Compare both coverage reports with the inventory. If anything is missing, review only the missing batches before reporting; an incomplete review cannot pass.

## Report

- Present `## Standards` and `## Spec` separately. End with blocker and advisory counts per axis. Do not let advisories change a pass into failure.
- Also when presenting, each findings should have severity, High, Medium, Low and clarify which ones must be fixed before proceeding.
- Recommend `FIX BEFORE PROCEEDING`, `CONSIDER FIXING`, or `PROCEED` from the evidenced severity, confidence, and risk, and name the findings that drive the recommendation. The review is read-only: the user decides whether to fix. Ask for that decision and do not edit or dispatch a fixer without explicit approval.
- Do not report advisories unless user asks for them.
- Provide a TL;DR section in the end in short in a table
