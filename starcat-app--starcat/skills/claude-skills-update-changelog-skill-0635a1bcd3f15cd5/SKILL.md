# Update Starcat Changelog

Read ALL git commits from the main Starcat project since the last version tag, then update
`CHANGELOG.md` (English) and `CHANGELOG-ZH.md` (Chinese) in `supports/starcat-pro/`.

## File Locations

| File | Path |
|------|------|
| Changelog (EN) | `supports/starcat-pro/CHANGELOG.md` |
| Changelog (ZH) | `supports/starcat-pro/CHANGELOG-ZH.md` |
| Git repo (source) | Starcat root (the Xcode project) |

---

## Step 0: Ask for Version Number (MANDATORY — Do This FIRST)

**This is a blocking step.** Before reading any git log or touching any file, you MUST
know the target version number. If the user did not provide one in their invocation,
immediately ask:

> "Which version number should I use for this changelog entry? (e.g., `1.2.0`, `1.1.1`)"

Do NOT proceed to Step 1 until the user answers. Do NOT guess or assume a version number.

If the user's invocation already includes a version number (e.g., "update changelog for 1.2.0"),
validate that it matches `X.Y.Z` format. If it doesn't, ask the user to provide a valid format.

The version number must be in `X.Y.Z` format (semantic versioning) because `release-direct.sh`
requires this format.

---

## Step 1: Determine Commit Range

```bash
# Latest tag
git tag --sort=-creatordate | head -1

# All commits since that tag (NO filtering, NO skip)
git log <latest-tag>..HEAD --oneline --no-merges

# Count
git log <latest-tag>..HEAD --oneline --no-merges | wc -l
```

If no tag exists, start from the first commit.

If there are 0 commits since the latest tag, stop and tell the user:
"No new commits since <latest-tag>. There's nothing to add to the changelog."

---

## Step 2: Read EVERY Commit Message (Do NOT Skip Any)

```bash
# Full messages for ALL non-merge commits — every single one
git log <latest-tag>..HEAD --format="---COMMIT---%n%h%n%s%n%b" --no-merges
```

**Critical rule**: Read EVERY commit first. Then in Step 3a, filter out non-user-facing
changes. Don't skip commits at read time — some commits with non-standard prefixes may
still describe user-visible changes. The filtering happens AFTER reading, based on content.

---

## Step 3: Filter and Categorize

### 3a: EXCLUDE Non-User-Facing Changes First

**The changelog is for end users.** Before categorizing, filter OUT commits that have
zero user-visible impact. These commits are NOT included in the changelog at all:

| Exclude | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Internal documentation | `docs:` commits, 审查报告, 进度文档, 专项 checklist |
| Build/config tooling | appcast.xml updates, CI scripts, .gitignore changes, sync scripts |
| Developer-only changes | Test fixes, worktree recovery, project file tweaks, code review artifacts |
| Meta/process commits | 回填进度, 记录验证, 补充审查, 落档方案, 同步口径 |

**Test**: "Would a Starcat user notice this change when using the app?" If no → exclude.

### 3b: Categorize Remaining Commits

Read the full message (subject + body) and classify into one of THREE categories:

| Category | How to recognize |
|----------|-----------------|
| **New** | New feature, new capability, new UI element, new workflow — something the user couldn't do before |
| **Improved** | Enhancement, optimization, polish, refactor, style improvement — something that got better but existed before |
| **Fixed** | Bug fix, correction, restoration — something that was broken and now works |

**Classification by Chinese keywords** (most commits use Chinese messages):

| Keywords | → Category |
|----------|-----------|
| `新增` `添加` `实现` `支持` `接入` `集成` `创建` `扩展` `放开` | **New** |
| `优化` `改进` `增强` `调整` `重构` `统一` `收敛` `简化` `完善` `升级` `迁移` `拆分` `还原` `隐藏` | **Improved** |
| `修复` `修正`(bug) `恢复`(误删) `解决` `避免` | **Fixed** |

**When the prefix and content disagree**, trust the content.

**For English-prefix commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `style:`):
- `feat:` → **New**
- `fix:` → **Fixed**
- `refactor:` `perf:` `style:` → **Improved**

---

## Step 4: Group Related Commits into Topic Bullets

This is the most important step. Don't write one bullet per commit — **merge related commits
into a single, comprehensive bullet point** that tells a coherent user story.

### How to group

1. Scan all commits and identify topic clusters (e.g., "Onboarding flow", "Agent workbench",
   "Landing page / DMG", "RAG workbench", "Sidebar / navigation")
2. For each cluster, write ONE bullet that synthesizes all related commits
3. A cluster typically has 2-8 commits; merge them into 1-2 bullets

### Example: multiple commits → one bullet

```
Commits:
  - feat(starcat): 新增新手引导返回功能及流程优化
  - feat(starcat): 新增调试模式下主窗口新手引导开关及流程优化
  - feat(starcat): 优化新手引导流程与分享指引交互
  - feat(starcat): 重构新手引导流程并扩展详情页与分享步骤

→ ONE bullet:
  EN: Onboarding flow: Back navigation, debug-mode controls, share guidance, and extended detail-page and sharing steps.
  ZH: 新手引导流程：支持返回导航、调试模式开关、分享指引，并扩展详情页与分享步骤。

Contrast — too technical and verbose (DON'T do this):
  ❌ EN: Implemented retreatStep method with spring animation for decrementing current step
         index, added DebugFlags.gettingStartedGuide persistence via Debug menu, introduced
         notification center event-driven mechanism for cross-component guide state sync,
         and refactored TagManagementView Sheet presentation to fix SwiftUI nesting re-render
  ❌ ZH: 实现 retreatStep 方法配合弹簧动画递减当前步骤索引，在 DebugFlags 中新增
         gettingStartedGuide 配置项通过 Debug 菜单持久化控制，引入通知中心事件驱动机制
         跨组件同步引导状态，并重构 TagManagementView 的 Sheet 呈现逻辑
```

### Bullet writing rules

写法以主规范为准：[`docs/5-规范/Changelog-更新规范.md`](../../../docs/5-规范/Changelog-更新规范.md) 第 4 节（App 更新说明友好）。摘要：

- **短标题 + 冒号 + 说明**：中文用全角 `：`；英文用半角 `: `（冒号后必须有空格）。不要靠第一个逗号拆标题；新条目不要用 em dash。
- **不要**以 `Added` / `Improved` / `Fixed` 或「新增 / 优化 / 修复」开头——分区标题已表达类别。
- **One idea per bullet**：短、可扫读；不写实现细节、文件路径、测试过程。
- **User-facing language**：写用户能感知的结果，像 App Store What's New。
- **Every non-excluded commit must be accounted for**：分组后确认 Step 3a 通过的 commit 都落在某条里。

→ 推荐形态：

```
EN: Repository pinning in Manage: Pin / Unpin, most-recently-pinned ordering, and a card-corner indicator.
ZH: Manage 仓库置顶：支持 Pin / Unpin，按最近置顶优先排列，卡片左上角显示置顶标识。
```

Contrast — too technical and verbose (DON'T do this):
  ❌ EN: Implemented retreatStep method with spring animation for decrementing current step
         index, added DebugFlags.gettingStartedGuide persistence via Debug menu...
  ❌ ZH: 实现 retreatStep 方法配合弹簧动画递减当前步骤索引...

## Step 5: Format and Insert into Both Files

Insert the new version section after the opening paragraph (the description line under the title)
and before the first existing `## <version>` section.

### English format

```markdown
## <version>

### New

- Short title: User-facing detail covering related changes.
- Another short title: Another detail.

### Improvements

- Short title: What got better for the user.

### Fixes

- Short title: What was broken and now works.
```

### Chinese format

```markdown
## <version>

### 新增

- 短标题：用户能懂的说明，可涵盖一组相关变更。

### 优化

- 短标题：体验或性能上的改进。

### 修复

- 短标题：已修好的问题。
```

分区标题必须用上表词（`New` / `Improvements` / `Fixes` 与 `新增` / `优化` / `修复`），不要写成 `Improved`、`Changed`、`改进`、`Bug Fixes`。完整约束见主规范第 4 节。

### Rules
- Categories with no entries → omit the section entirely
- Blank line between sections and between bullets
- Bullets start with `- ` (dash + space)
- Bullets use `短标题：说明`（中文全角冒号）或 `Short title: detail`（英文冒号+空格）；不要句首分类动词、不要用 em dash
- The version link reference goes at the bottom of the file（starcat-pro 渠道若在用）

---

## Step 6: Add Version Link Reference

At the bottom of each file, insert BEFORE the previous version's link:

```markdown
[<version>]: https://github.com/starcat-app/starcat-pro/releases/tag/<version>
```

Maintain reverse chronological order (newest first).

---

## Step 7: Verify Before Writing

Before touching any file, present the complete proposed changelog to the user:

1. Show the version number
2. Show ALL bullets under each category (EN + ZH side by side)
3. Confirm the count: "Total N commits → M user-facing bullets (X New, Y Improved, Z Fixed), K excluded (docs/tooling/internal)"

**Do NOT write files until the user explicitly approves the proposed content.**

After writing, verify:
- Both files have identical bullet counts per category
- Version number matches across both files
- Format matches existing entries exactly
- Version link references are present and in correct order

---

## Step 8: Offer to Create Git Tag

After both changelog files have been written and verified, ask the user:

> "Changelog updated. Would you like me to create a git tag `v<version>` for this release?"

Use the exact version number from Step 0. Do NOT create the tag without explicit confirmation.

If the user says yes:

```bash
git tag -a v<version> -m "v<version>"
```

Verify the tag was created:

```bash
git tag -l "v<version>"
```

---

## Step 9: Offer to Run Release Script

After the tag is created (or skipped by user), ask:

> "Would you like me to run the Direct release script (`scripts/release-direct.sh`) to publish this version?"

**Do NOT run the script without explicit confirmation.**

If the user says yes, present the script's requirements and parameters for confirmation:

### Script: `scripts/release-direct.sh <version>`

**Prerequisites:**
- Must be on `main` branch (or set `STARCAT_RELEASE_SKIP_BRANCH_CHECK=1`)
- Must have clean working tree (or set `STARCAT_RELEASE_SKIP_DIRTY_CHECK=1`)
- Requires: `git`, `python3`, `rsync`, `ssh`, `curl`

**Key parameters to confirm with user:**

| Parameter | Purpose | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| `STARCAT_NOTARIZE=1` | Enable notarization | Required for production release |
| `STARCAT_RELEASE_SKIP_TAG=1` | Skip tag creation | Set if tag was already created in Step 8 |
| `STARCAT_RELEASE_DRY_RUN=1` | Dry run (no actual changes) | Suggest for first run to verify |
| `STARCAT_RELEASE_HOST=<host>` | SSH host for upload | Default: `aliyun` |
| `STARCAT_RELEASE_SKIP_NGINX=1` | Skip nginx deploy | Optional |
| `STARCAT_RELEASE_SKIP_SITE=1` | Skip site deploy | Optional |

**Ask the user:**
1. Is this a production release? (Yes → `STARCAT_NOTARIZE=1`)
2. Run dry-run first to verify?
3. Confirm SSH host (default: `aliyun`)
4. Any steps to skip?

After confirming all parameters, construct and execute the command:

```bash
# Example — actual command depends on user's answers
STARCAT_NOTARIZE=1 STARCAT_RELEASE_SKIP_TAG=1 ./scripts/release-direct.sh <version>
```

**Note**: This script pushes tags to `origin`, deploys nginx config and site pages, packages the DMG,
signs it for Sparkle, uploads all artifacts to the remote server, and verifies remote URLs.
It is a full production release pipeline — make sure the user understands the scope.

---

## Important Constraints

1. **User-facing only** — exclude internal docs, build tooling, test fixes, review reports,
   appcast updates, sync scripts, and developer-only changes. Test: "Would a user notice this?"
2. **Read ALL commits first, filter later** — don't skip at read time; filter based on content in Step 3a
3. **Merge aggressively** — one bullet covers a topic cluster, not one commit
4. **User perspective** — describe what changed for the user, not the code
5. **Don't fabricate** — only include changes actually present in the git log
6. **Don't duplicate** — don't repeat changes already listed in earlier versions
7. **Preserve history** — never modify existing version sections
8. **Bilingual 1:1** — every EN bullet must have a corresponding ZH bullet
9. **Ask first, write later** — always show the proposed content and get approval
