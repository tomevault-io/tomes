# Counterfact Repository Basics Skill

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when you need quick repository orientation, command references, or issue-proposal workflow rules.

## What Counterfact is

Counterfact is a TypeScript-based mock server generator that turns OpenAPI/Swagger specs into live, stateful mock APIs with hot reload, a REPL, and Swagger UI.

```bash
npx counterfact@latest https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json api
```

## Repository structure

```text
src/
  app.ts                      # Main entry point; generation + server + REPL orchestration
  server/                     # Koa server, dispatcher, registry, hot-reload internals
  typescript-generator/       # OpenAPI parsing and TypeScript generation
  counterfact-types/          # Public API types exposed to route-handler authors
  repl/                       # Interactive terminal for runtime state control
  migrate/                    # Helpers for migrating generated route files
  client/                     # Built-in dashboard/docs page templates
  util/                       # Shared utilities
bin/
  counterfact.js              # CLI entry point
test/                         # Jest unit tests
test-black-box/               # Python black-box integration tests
templates/                    # Generator scaffold templates
```
