# Scenario Skill

## Purpose

Create scenario files that seed and manipulate runtime data for Counterfact
mocks.

## Where scenario files live

- Put scenario modules in `scenarios/`.
- Keep `scenarios/index.ts` as the primary export surface.
- Use `startup` in `scenarios/index.ts` for automatic boot-time seeding.

## Scenario function API

A scenario is a function receiving `$` and using it to access context and route
helpers.

```ts
// Path is relative to the scenarios directory at the generated project root.
import type { Scenario } from "../types/_.context.js";

export const startup: Scenario = ($) => {
  $.context.createThing({ name: "example" });
};
```

Typical `$` usage in scenarios:

- `$.context` for state changes
- `$.route("/path")` for calling routes from scenario setup flows

## Required rules

- Keep reusable business operations in contexts; scenarios orchestrate calls.
- Keep scenarios focused on setup flows and fixtures.
- Do **not** create unit tests in this skill; scenario behavior should be checked
  through end-to-end route behavior and manual/acceptance flows.
