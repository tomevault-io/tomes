## What Are Agent Personas?

Agent personas are pre-defined identities in `.agents/agents/` that specialize an AI agent for a specific domain. Each persona defines:

- **Domain (EXCLUSIVE)** — what the agent is responsible for
- **Boundaries (DO NOT CROSS)** — what the agent must never do
- **Skills** — which skills to load from `.agents/skills/`
- **Workflow** — step-by-step process for the agent's work
- **Parallel Dispatch** — how to run multiple instances safely

Personas are consumed by the `/workflow-team` pipeline manager, which dispatches them as sub-agents. They enforce **MECE** (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) boundaries — every agent knows exactly what it owns and what it must not touch.

## How Agents Collaborate

### Handoff Patterns

Agents reference each other explicitly for handoffs:

- **Discovery → Flagging → Elimination:**
  `@scout` discovers anti-patterns → `@reviewer` flags them with severity → `@refactoring-specialist` eliminates them

- **Research → Design → Build:**
  `@scout` gathers context → `@architect` produces contracts → `@backend-engineer` implements

- **Review → Fix:**
  `@reviewer` produces findings → engineering agents fix issues

- **Profile → Analyze → Optimize:**
  `@performance-engineer` profiles → `@reviewer` reviews data → `@performance-engineer` implements fixes

### Parallel Dispatch

Each agent persona includes a `Parallel Dispatch` section defining:
- **Scope Axis** — how to partition work (by feature, by concern, by module)
- **Write Scope** — files the agent instance owns exclusively
- **Shared Reads** — files the agent can read but not write
- **Constraint** — what prevents cross-instance conflicts
- **Integration** — how parallel results are reconciled

This enables multiple instances of the same agent type to work in parallel without file conflicts.
