# Performance Optimization Skill

## When to Use

- User provides profiling data (pprof, flamegraph, py-spy, Chrome DevTools, Dart DevTools)
- User asks to analyze or optimize performance of a specific component
- A benchmark regression is detected
- After deploying a new feature that touches a hot path

## Core Methodology

    P6 -->|No| P3
```

### Step 1: Profile

Collect profiling data using the language-appropriate tool. Load the relevant `languages/*.md` module for exact commands.

**Output:** Raw profiling data (CPU profile, heap profile, or trace).

### Step 2: Analyze

Read the profile. Focus on these principles (universal across all runtimes):

1. **Focus on `cum` (cumulative):** The total resources consumed by a function AND everything it called. This finds the expensive architectural flows.
2. **Contextualize `flat`:** Resources consumed by the function itself only. If a runtime function (GC, malloc, syscall) has high flat time, trace it UP the call chain to find the user-land code that triggered it.
3. **Ignore runtime noise:** Scheduler overhead (`runtime.mcall`, `runtime.systemstack`, GC workers) will always appear. Note if GC pressure is high, but don't try to "fix" the scheduler.
4. **Separate benchmark artifacts from production cost:** Test harness allocations (e.g., `httptest.NewRequest`, `ResponseRecorder`) inflate heap profiles but don't exist in production.

**Output:** Structured analysis document in `docs/research_logs/{component}-perf-analysis.md`.

### Step 2b: Opportunity Scan

**Scope:** Apply this checklist ONLY within the hot paths identified by the profiler in Step 2. Do NOT scan the entire codebase — that leads to premature optimization. The profiler pointed you at specific modules; now systematically scan those modules for these categories of waste.

**Concurrency & Parallelism:**
- Sequential I/O calls that could run concurrently (parallel fetch, gather, join)
- Task/goroutine/thread spawn overhead exceeding the work itself
- Locks held across I/O boundaries (database calls, network, file system)
- Unbounded queues or channels causing memory pressure under load
- CPU-bound work running on an async/event-loop runtime instead of a worker pool

**Memory & Allocation:**
- Heap allocations inside hot loops (new objects per iteration)
- Missing pre-sized collections (growing arrays/maps from zero)
- Unnecessary copies where borrowing, referencing, or copy-on-write suffices
- Temporary objects that could be reused across iterations (buffer pools)
- Large structures passed by value instead of by reference

**Data Structures & Algorithms:**
- Linear scans (O(n)) where hash-based lookups (O(1)) would work
- Nested iterations creating O(n²) behavior replaceable with single-pass or hash-based approaches
- Missing early returns or short-circuit evaluation skipping unnecessary work
- Redundant sorting of already-sorted data or where ordering is not required
- Inefficient string building (concatenation in loops instead of buffered writes)

**Serialization & I/O:**
- Full deserialization when only a subset of fields is needed
- Missing buffered I/O on file or network streams
- Repeated serialization of the same unchanged data (cache the serialized bytes)
- Synchronous/blocking I/O on an async runtime
- Excessive debug/trace logging in hot paths without level gating

**Caching & Lazy Initialization:**
- Repeated expensive computations with identical inputs (regex compilation, template parsing, config loading)
- Missing lazy initialization for rarely-used resources
- Redundant work that could be memoized or pre-computed at startup

**Output:** Append opportunity scan findings to the analysis document. Each finding must reference the profiler evidence that led to the hot path.

### Step 3: Prioritize

Rank fixes by **impact/risk ratio**:

| Priority | Criteria |
|---|---|
| Do first | Low risk, high impact (caching, pre-allocation, fast-reject) |
| Do second | Medium risk, high impact (library swap, algorithm change) |
| Do last | High risk, high impact (major refactor, custom implementation) |
| Skip | Any risk, low impact (micro-optimization below noise floor) |

**Rule:** If a fix requires more than 1 day AND saves < 20% on the hot path, defer it.

### Step 4: Optimize

Implement one fix at a time. For each fix:
1. Write tests FIRST (TDD — Red → Green → Refactor)
2. Implement the fix
3. Add `PERF:` inline comments explaining the optimization rationale — what the profiler showed and why the new approach is faster. Without these, a future developer may "clean up" the optimization thinking it's unnecessary complexity.
4. Run all existing tests to verify no regression
5. Benchmark immediately
6. Run quality checks (formatter, linter, security scanner)
7. Commit independently using the structured format below

**Never batch multiple optimizations into one commit.** Each fix must be independently verifiable and revertable.

**Commit format:**

```
perf(scope): one-line description

What: <the optimization implemented>
Why: <what the profiler showed — the performance problem it solves>
Impact: <expected improvement, e.g., "Eliminates ~500 allocations per request">
Measurement: <how to verify, e.g., "Run BenchmarkX, compare allocs/op">
```

**Size guidance:** Each fix should be a focused, minimal change. If a fix requires > ~100 lines of changes or touches > 3 files, re-evaluate whether it's actually a refactor in disguise — and if so, use the `/refactor` workflow instead. Performance commits are surgical; architectural restructuring is a separate concern.

### Step 5: Benchmark

Compare before/after with the **exact same benchmark configuration** (same `-benchtime`, same `-count`, same machine load). Report:
- `ns/op` (latency)
- `B/op` (memory per operation)
- `allocs/op` (heap allocations per operation)

### Step 6: When to Stop

**Stop optimizing when any of these are true:**
- Remaining CPU is in hardware-optimized assembly (AES-NI, P-256, SIMD) — you cannot beat the hardware
- Remaining allocations are from the language runtime itself (GC, goroutine stacks, HTTP server internals)
- The fix requires a custom implementation of a well-audited library — the security/maintenance risk outweighs the perf gain
- The measured improvement is < 5% and within benchmark noise
- The remaining optimization requires a large architectural refactor (> 3 files, > 100 lines) — defer to a dedicated `/refactor` session with its own testing and verification

> **Documenting failures:** Record optimizations that were **tried but didn't work** in the
> research log (`docs/research_logs/{component}-perf-analysis.md`). For each failed or skipped
> optimization, document: (1) what was tried, (2) expected improvement, (3) actual result,
> and (4) why it didn't work. This prevents future sessions from repeating the same failed
> experiments. Also note any surprising profiler findings that reveal codebase-specific
> performance characteristics.

## Optimization Pattern Catalog

These are generic, language-agnostic patterns. Apply them when the profiling data shows the corresponding symptom.

### Pattern: Result Caching

**Symptom:** Same expensive computation repeated with identical inputs (crypto verification, JSON parsing, regex compilation).

**Fix:** Cache results keyed by input hash. Use bounded LRU with TTL to prevent memory exhaustion.

**Safety invariant:** When caching security-sensitive results (auth tokens, permission checks):
- ALWAYS re-validate expiry/revocation on cache hit
- ALWAYS bound cache size (DoS protection)
- ALWAYS set TTL shorter than the security credential's validity period

### Pattern: Pre-allocation

**Symptom:** High `allocs/op` from repeatedly constructing the same objects (option structs, config slices, header maps).

**Fix:** Build the object once at init time, share it read-only across requests. Safe for concurrent use if the object is immutable after construction.

### Pattern: Fast-Reject / Short-Circuit

**Symptom:** Expensive validation path runs even for clearly invalid inputs.

**Fix:** Add a cheap structural pre-check before the expensive path. Examples: check string length before regex, count delimiters before parsing, check content-type before deserialization.

### Pattern: Library Swap

**Symptom:** High allocation count or CPU in a third-party library's internal parsing/serialization.

**Fix:** Replace with a library that uses lower-allocation strategies (manual scanners vs `encoding/json.Decoder`, zero-copy parsing, arena allocation).

**Safety invariant:** When swapping security-critical libraries (JWT, TLS, crypto):
- Explicitly restrict accepted algorithms (prevent algorithm confusion attacks)
- Verify the replacement library is well-audited and actively maintained
- Run the full existing test suite — no behavioral change allowed

### Pattern: Pooling

**Symptom:** High GC pressure from many short-lived objects of the same type being allocated and discarded rapidly.

**Fix:** Use an object pool (sync.Pool in Go, object pool in Java, arena in Rust) to reuse allocations.

**Caveat:** Only effective when objects are uniform in size and have a clear acquire/release lifecycle. Misuse creates subtle bugs.

### Pattern: Batching

**Symptom:** Many small I/O operations (DB queries, HTTP calls, file writes) dominating wall-clock time.

**Fix:** Batch operations into fewer, larger calls. Examples: batch INSERT, pipeline Redis commands, buffer writes.

### Pattern: Artifact Partitioning by Change Frequency

**Symptom:** Deploying a small change invalidates a large cached artifact (JS bundle, Docker image, compiled binary), forcing consumers to re-download/rebuild the entire thing.

**Fix:** Partition build artifacts by change frequency so that stable layers survive volatile deploys:
- **Stable layer**: dependencies, vendor libraries, base images — changes rarely
- **Volatile layer**: application code — changes on every deploy

**Examples across stacks:**
- **JS/Bundler**: Vite `manualChunks` / Webpack `splitChunks` to isolate vendor libraries into separate chunks
- **Docker**: multi-stage builds with `COPY go.mod` + `RUN go mod download` BEFORE `COPY . .` — dependency layer caches across builds
- **Monorepo**: separate packages by change frequency so CI only rebuilds what changed

**Safety invariant:** Total artifact size stays the same or slightly increases (chunk overhead). The benefit is on **repeat consumption** — stable layers serve from cache.

**When NOT to apply:** One-shot artifacts with no caching benefit (single-use CI, ephemeral environments).

### Pattern: Dependency Discovery Parallelization

**Symptom:** Sequential resource discovery creates waterfalls — each resource is discovered only after the previous one completes (download → parse → discover next → download → ...).

**Fix:** Declare dependencies as early as possible so the system can fetch them in parallel:
- Move resource declarations upstream (earlier in the boot/parse sequence)
- Use explicit hints to bypass sequential discovery chains

**Examples across stacks:**
- **Browser**: `<link rel="preconnect">` to establish connections before CSS/JS requests them; move CSS `@import` to HTML `<link>` for parallel discovery
- **Go**: `go mod download` before build to prefetch modules
- **DB**: connection pool warm-up at startup instead of on first query
- **DNS**: `dns-prefetch` hints for domains the app will contact

**Safety invariant:** Only pre-declare resources you WILL use. Unused preconnects/prefetches waste resources (TCP connections, DNS queries, module downloads).

### Pattern: Concurrent-Fetch Dedup

**Symptom:** Network tab shows two identical API calls fired at the same time. Multiple UI components mount simultaneously and each independently calls the same fetch function.

**Fix:** Add a loading-state guard (semaphore) at the store/service layer:

```
async function fetchData() {
    if (isLoading) return    // ← drop duplicate in-flight request
    isLoading = true
    try { data = await api.getData() }
    finally { isLoading = false }
}
```

**When to apply:** When the same data store is used by multiple co-mounted components (e.g., a navigation bar and a page view both calling `fetchProfile()` on mount).

**Caveat:** This is a simple semaphore, not request dedup. If the data needs refreshing after the in-flight call completes, the caller should retry. For advanced use cases, consider a proper request dedup cache (e.g., TanStack Query's `staleTime`).

## Anti-Patterns (Things NOT to Do)

1. **Don't optimize runtime internals.** If `runtime.mallocgc` or `runtime.gcBgMarkWorker` is high, fix the USER CODE that triggers allocations — don't try to tune the GC directly.
2. **Don't replace battle-tested crypto with custom implementations.** The performance ceiling of ECDSA/RSA is in the math. Accept it.
3. **Don't optimize based on gut feeling.** Always profile first. Premature optimization is the root of all evil.
4. **Don't combine multiple optimizations into one commit.** If a combined commit causes a regression, you can't isolate which fix is at fault.
5. **Don't disable security features for performance.** Algorithm restriction, input validation, and expiry checks are non-negotiable.
6. **Don't profile without a stable baseline.** Run benchmarks with fixed parameters (`-benchtime`, `-count`, same machine load). Without a reproducible baseline, before/after comparisons are meaningless noise.
