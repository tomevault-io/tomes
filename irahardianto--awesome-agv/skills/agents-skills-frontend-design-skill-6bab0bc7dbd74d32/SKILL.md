# Frontend Design Skill

This skill guides creation of **distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces** that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Follow the phased workflow below. Each phase has concrete reference material — use it, don't invent from scratch.

---

## Phased Workflow

### Phase 1: Design Direction

Before touching any code, commit to a clear aesthetic direction. Answer these:

**Context questions:**
- What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- What's the one thing someone will remember about this design?
- What aesthetic direction fits? (Choose ONE — don't blend randomly)

**Aesthetic directions to pick from:**
Brutally minimal · Maximalist chaos · Retro-futuristic · Organic/natural · Luxury/refined · Playful/toy-like · Editorial/magazine · Brutalist/raw · Art deco/geometric · Soft/pastel · Industrial/utilitarian · Sci-fi/cyberpunk

**CRITICAL:** Every generation must make a fresh choice. Never default to the same direction twice. Vary light/dark themes, fonts, and palettes across generations.

**Deliverables from Phase 1:**
- ✓ Named aesthetic direction (e.g., "editorial luxury, dark theme")
- ✓ Font pairing selected from `references/typography.md`
- ✓ Color palette selected from `references/color-palettes.md`
- ✓ Layout composition(s) selected from `references/layout-compositions.md`

---

### Phase 2: Token System

Set up the design token foundation before writing any component code.

1. Copy `examples/design-tokens.css` into the project
2. Override the palette primitives with your chosen palette's HSL values
3. Override `--font-display` and `--font-body` with your chosen font pairing
4. Add the Google Fonts `@import` to your HTML `<head>` (with preconnect hints)

```html
<!-- Always preconnect BEFORE the font stylesheet -->
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[your @import from typography.md]">
```

**Deliverables from Phase 2:**
- ✓ `design-tokens.css` (or equivalent) in place with chosen palette/fonts
- ✓ All colors, spacing, typography, shadows, and motion defined as CSS variables
- ✓ No hardcoded color values or magic numbers anywhere in component code

---

### Phase 3: Build

Load the framework module for your target and implement components using design tokens.

**Framework modules — load the relevant one:**

| Target | Module |
|---|---|
| Vue 3 (`<script setup>`) | `frameworks/vue.md` |
| HTML + Vanilla CSS/JS | `frameworks/html-css.md` |

**Build principles:**
- Implement components from the layout compositions you chose
- Apply motion patterns from `references/motion-patterns.md` at high-impact moments: page load, scroll reveals, hover states
- Use only `transform` and `opacity` for animations — never `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`
- Every interactive element needs a hover state AND a focus-visible state
- Stagger entrance animations for groups of elements (cards, list items)

**Mobile responsive (load `references/mobile-responsive.md`):**
- Write CSS mobile-first: base styles for phone, `min-width` queries for larger screens
- Every tap target: ≥ 44×44px (`min-height: 44px; min-width: 44px`)
- Use `100svh` not `100vh` for full-screen sections (iOS Safari compatibility)
- Add `env(safe-area-inset-*)` padding on fixed bottom elements
- Test at 375px, 768px, and 1280px minimum — use the decision matrix in the module

**PWA readiness (load `references/pwa-checklist.md` for production apps):**
- Add `manifest.json` with correct `name`, `icons` (192 + 512 + maskable), `theme_color`
- Add PWA meta tags to `<head>` (theme-color, apple-mobile-web-app-capable, apple-touch-icon)
- Register a service worker with appropriate caching strategy
- Create an offline fallback page (`offline.html`)
- For Vite projects: prefer `vite-plugin-pwa` over manual SW

### Phase 4: Polish & Verify

**Visual polish checklist:**
- [ ] Typography: Are display and body fonts visually distinct and harmonious?
- [ ] Color: Is the palette cohesive? Do accents draw the eye to the right places?
- [ ] Spacing: Is there enough breathing room between sections? (minimum `--space-20` between major sections)
- [ ] Motion: Does the page feel alive on load? Are hover states immediate and satisfying?
- [ ] Backgrounds: Is there depth, texture, or gradient — or is it a flat color?
- [ ] Responsive: Does it look great at 375px? 768px? 1280px? No horizontal overflow?
- [ ] Touch: Are all interactive targets ≥ 44px? Does navigation work on mobile?
- [ ] PWA (if applicable): Does Lighthouse PWA score 100? Is offline fallback working?

**Accessibility verification:**
```bash
# Run the visual audit after starting your dev server
bash .agents/skills/frontend-design/scripts/visual-audit.sh http://localhost:[port]
```

The audit checks:
- Color contrast violations (WCAG AA minimum — 4.5:1 for text)
- Missing alt text, accessible names, and ARIA labels
- Skip link presence
- Semantic heading structure (one `<h1>` per page)
- Font loading performance (CLS)
- `prefers-reduced-motion` override presence

**Fix all CRITICAL issues before marking the task complete.** Warnings are acceptable if documented.

## Anti-Pattern Catalog

These are the most common ways agents produce generic output. Identify and avoid them.

| Anti-Pattern | What It Looks Like | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Gradient Soup** | Purple-to-blue gradient on white cards everywhere | Use one deliberate gradient for ONE element (hero BG, accent bar). Source from `color-palettes.md`. |
| **Font Stack Collapse** | Entire page in Inter, Roboto, or system fonts | Pick a pairing from `typography.md`. Always use 2 distinct fonts with clear display/body roles. |
| **Shadow Boxing** | `box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)` on every card | Use `--shadow-sm` for resting, `--shadow-md` for hover. Never apply the same shadow everywhere. |
| **Animation Scatter** | Random `transition: all 0.3s ease` on dozens of elements | Use `--transition-all-interactions` only for interactive elements. Apply entrance animations sparingly. |
| **Whitespace Desert** | Cramped layout with 16px gaps between everything | Section padding minimum `--space-16`. Hero sections minimum `100svh`. Let content breathe. |
| **Button Rainbow** | 5 different button colors across a single page | One `--primary` button, one `--secondary`, one `--ghost`. That's the system. |
| **Flat Backgrounds** | Solid `#1a1a2e` with nothing else | Add texture: gradient mesh, noise overlay, subtle pattern, or a layered radial gradient. |
| **Generic Layout** | Centered content, full-width rows, constant padding | Use a layout composition from `references/layout-compositions.md`. Break the grid deliberately. |
| **Hover Nothing** | No state change on hover for interactive elements | Every card, button, and link needs a hover state. Minimum: color change. Better: lift + shadow. |
| **One-Size Typography** | Body text size used for everything | Use the full type scale. Hero in `--text-hero`, section headings in `--text-3xl`, body in `--text-base`. |
| **Desktop-First CSS** | `max-width` breakpoints everywhere, mobile layout breaks | Write base styles for mobile. Layer up with `min-width`. See `mobile-responsive.md`. |
| **Tiny Tap Targets** | 24px buttons, links with no padding on mobile | Minimum 44×44px interactive area. Expand with padding or `::after` pseudo-element. |

## Reference Modules

Load these when implementing. Don't rely on memory — read the module.

| Module | When to Load |
|---|---|
| `references/typography.md` | Choosing fonts — 30 curated pairings |
| `references/color-palettes.md` | Choosing colors — 15 named palettes, light + dark |
| `references/motion-patterns.md` | Implementing animations — entrance, hover, scroll, micro |
| `references/layout-compositions.md` | Structuring pages — 15 named compositions |
| `references/mobile-responsive.md` | Mobile-first methodology, touch targets, viewport units, navigation patterns |
| `references/pwa-checklist.md` | Manifest, service worker, offline fallback, install prompt, Lighthouse PWA |
| `frameworks/vue.md` | Building in Vue 3 |
| `frameworks/html-css.md` | Building in HTML/CSS |
| `examples/design-tokens.css` | Starting a token system |

---

## Rule Compliance

Before marking complete, verify:
- **Project Structure** — component organization follows `project-structure.md`
- **Testing** — component tests follow `testing-strategy.md`
- **Security** — XSS prevention, no `innerHTML` with unescaped user data (`security-principles.md`)
- **Accessibility** — WCAG AA contrast, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML (`accessibility-principles.md`)
- **Audit script** — visual-audit.sh passes with no CRITICAL failures

**IMPORTANT:** Implementation complexity must match the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs require elaborate animation. Minimalist designs require meticulous spacing precision. Both fail if executed without care.

Remember: you are capable of extraordinary creative work. These references exist to ground your output in concrete, actionable choices — not to constrain your creativity. Use them as a launching pad.
