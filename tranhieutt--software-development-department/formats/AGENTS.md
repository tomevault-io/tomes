# Claude Code Software Development Department

Software development managed through specialized Claude Code subagents.
Each agent owns a specific domain, enforcing separation of concerns and quality.

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES (Must obey on every turn)
- **NO AUTOPILOT:** Every task follows **Question -> Options -> Decision -> Draft -> Approval**.
- **CONFIRM BEFORE PROACTIVE WRITES:** If the agent decides to create/edit a file *outside* the explicitly requested scope, MUST ask "May I write this to [filepath]?". If the user explicitly named the file or `acceptEdits` mode is active, skip the question.
- **NO COMMITS WITHOUT PERMISSION:** Multi-file changes require explicit approval for the full changeset.
- **GIT SNAPSHOT WARNING:** The Internal Git status is a STALE SNAPSHOT! You MUST run `git status` or `git diff` via BashTool before making git operations or tracking git state.
- **SAFETY TIERS & RISK ASSESSMENT:** Before editing code or executing commands, assign a Risk Tier (Low: reversible; Medium: shared code, needs rollback plan; High: destructive/prod, requires explicit approval).
- **TOOL CONSTRAINTS (READ BEFORE WRITE/EDIT):** You MUST read a file's contents before writing to or editing it. For edits, strictly adhere to string replacement uniqueness constraints.
- **ANNOTATION PROTOCOL:** When you discover unexpected API behavior, undocumented caveats, version bugs, or non-obvious workarounds — **immediately** add a dated entry to `.claude/memory/annotations.md` via `/annotate`. Do NOT wait to be asked. Knowledge that is not persisted is lost.

## 🧭 Implicit Workflow Commands (Process Shields)
If the user invokes these short commands, or if the task context implies them, YOU MUST trigger the corresponding skill:
- **`/plan`**: ALWAYS trigger the `planning-and-task-breakdown` skill first for complex epics. Output an atomic markdown task checklist. **Do NOT write code yet.**
- **`/spec`**: ALWAYS trigger the `spec-driven-development` skill before writing logic for a task. Secure explicit blueprint/architecture approval from the user.
- **`/tdd`**: ALWAYS trigger the `test-driven-development` skill when writing the source. Write failing tests, check CMD outputs (🔴 RED), implement, and pass (🟢 GREEN). **Never claim success without terminal test logs.**
- **`/context`** or **`/memory`**: ALWAYS trigger the `context-engineering` skill. Diagnose context stuffing, optimize persistent vs episodic knowledge, and enforce the Research-Plan-Reset-Implement cycle using `mcp_supermemory` tools.
- **`/diagnose`**: ALWAYS trigger the `diagnose` skill for complex, non-obvious failures. Use sequential Investigator -> Verifier -> Solver logic.
- **`/vertical-slice`**: ALWAYS trigger the `vertical-slicing` skill when planning fullstack features. Divide work into functional end-to-end units.
- **`/ui-spec`**: ALWAYS trigger the `ui-spec` skill. Transform PRDs and prototypes into rigorous technical UI specifications with state matrices.

> **Commands vs Skills precedence:** Workflow commands trên đây là **gates** (xác định stage của task); skills là **domain expertise** (cung cấp content). Commands CHỨA skills, không thay thế.

## Project Durable Memory

@.claude/memory/MEMORY.md

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Shell (Bash), JavaScript (Node.js), PowerShell
- **Frontend Framework**: none (CLI Infrastructure)
- **Backend Framework**: Model Context Protocol (MCP), Git Bash Hooks
- **Database**: Filesystem (Markdown/JSONL), Supermemory MCP
- **Deployment**: Shell installation scripts (`init-sdd.sh`, `init-sdd.ps1`)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (planned)

> **First session?** If no stack has been configured yet, run `/start` to begin
> the guided onboarding flow.
