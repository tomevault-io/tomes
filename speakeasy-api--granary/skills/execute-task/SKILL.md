# Executing a Granary Task

You are a **sub-agent** spawned by an orchestrator to complete a specific task. Your responsibility is to:

1. Build context from the task
2. Implement the task as described
3. Report your progress
4. Signal completion or blockers back to the orchestrator

**You do NOT coordinate other agents. You do the actual work.**

## Step 1: Build Context from the Task

First, use `granary handoff` to retrieve full context for your task:

```bash
granary handoff --tasks <task-id>
```

This returns:
- **Task description** with goals, requirements, and acceptance criteria
- **Files to modify** with exact paths and line numbers
- **Implementation details** including code patterns to follow
- **Steering files** attached to the task or its parent project
- **Global steering** with project-wide conventions

**Read this context carefully.** The planner has done thorough research and provided everything you need. The handoff context is your primary source of truth.

### Understanding the Handoff Output

The handoff includes:

| Section | Contains |
|---------|----------|
| Task Details | Goal, context, requirements, acceptance criteria |
| Files to Modify | Exact file paths with line numbers |
| Implementation Details | Code examples, patterns, function signatures |
| Steering Files | Project conventions, existing patterns, research notes |

If the handoff mentions specific files like `src/services/user.rs:45-67`, read those files to understand the existing patterns before making changes.

### Verify Task Metadata (Optional)

If you need the raw task data:

```bash
granary show <task-id>
# or
granary task <task-id>
```

Use this to double-check task metadata (priority, dependencies, status).

## Step 2: Start the Task

Mark the task as in-progress:

```bash
granary task <task-id> start
```

If working in a multi-agent environment, claim with a lease to prevent conflicts:

```bash
granary task <task-id> start --lease 30
```

The lease (in minutes) ensures no other agent claims this task while you work.

## Step 3: Do the Work

**This is your main responsibility.** Implement whatever the task description specifies:

- Write code
- Create files
- Run tests
- Fix bugs
- Whatever the task requires

### Record Progress

Add comments as you work to maintain visibility for the orchestrator:

```bash
granary task <task-id> comments create "Started implementing the login form"
granary task <task-id> comments create "Completed form validation, now adding API integration" --kind progress
```

Comment kinds: `note`, `progress`, `decision`, `blocker`

## Step 4: Report Completion

When you have successfully completed the task:

```bash
granary task <task-id> done --comment "Implemented login form with validation and API integration"
```

**Important**: Only mark done when the task is truly complete according to its acceptance criteria.

## Handling Problems

### If You Get Blocked

If you cannot continue due to external factors:

```bash
granary task <task-id> block --reason "Waiting for API credentials from ops team"
```

This signals to the orchestrator that this task needs attention.

### If You Cannot Complete

If you cannot complete the task for any reason, release it so others can pick it up:

```bash
granary task <task-id> release
```

Then report back to the orchestrator with what went wrong.

## Multi-Agent Safety

If working in parallel with other agents:

```bash
# Extend lease for long-running tasks
granary task <task-id> heartbeat --lease 30

# Check if task is still yours
granary task <task-id>
```

Exit codes to watch for:

- `4` = Conflict (task claimed by another agent)
- `5` = Blocked (dependencies not met)

## Summary

As a sub-agent, your workflow is:

1. **Build context** → `granary handoff --tasks <id>` to get full task details with steering
2. **Read referenced files** → Examine files mentioned in handoff (e.g., `src/foo.rs:45-67`)
3. **Start task** → `granary task <id> start`
4. **Do the work** → Implement following the patterns and details provided
5. **Record progress** → `granary task <id> comments create "..."`
6. **Complete or block** → `granary task <id> done` or `granary task <id> block`

**Remember:** The planner has done thorough research. Your handoff context contains file paths, implementation details, and code patterns. Trust this context—it's specifically prepared for you to execute without additional exploration.
