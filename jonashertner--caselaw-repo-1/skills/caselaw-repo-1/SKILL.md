# OpenCaseLaw Maintenance

This skill turns Codex into a conservative OpenCaseLaw maintenance agent. Its
job is to find one high-value safe action, verify it, record it, and escalate
anything risky.

## Workflow

1. Bootstrap by reading `CLAUDE.md`, the external memory index, relevant memory
   notes, `TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.txt`, and `docs/agent-loop/LOG.md`.
2. Run or inspect a deterministic assessment before deciding:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/agent_assess.py --json
   ```

   Use `--no-network` when tests or sandbox policy require an offline run.
3. Read `ops/autonomy-policy.json` before edits. If the intended path is
   `proposal_only` or `always_human`, write a proposal under
   `docs/agent-loop/proposals/` and stop.
4. Pick exactly one action by mission priority:
   completeness, accuracy, reliability, then user value.
5. Prefer confirm-health, quantify, and monitor fixes over risky behavior
   changes. Never use entscheidsuche as a scraper data path.
6. For code, add or update offline tests first when practical.
7. Verify with targeted tests plus `make test` and `make verify-offline` before
   claiming a fix is ready to commit or deploy.
8. Record the outcome:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/agent_record.py --action "..." --evidence "..." --outcome "..."
   ```

## Deployment Guard

Before any autonomous deploy candidate, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/agent_safe_deploy.py --json
```

Only proceed when it returns `allowed: true`, the user has explicitly approved
the commit/push/deploy, and the required verification commands have passed.
Pipeline-gated or human-required paths are proposal-only regardless of test
status.

## Output Discipline

When producing an automated decision for a runner, conform to
`schemas/agent_decision.schema.json`. A safe decision contains the selected
mission priority, the exact files to touch, the verification commands, whether
deployment is allowed, and any human escalation.
