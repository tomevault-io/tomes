# EDA PCB Skill

PCB layout, component placement, and routing.

## Auto-Activation Triggers

This skill activates when:
- User asks to "layout PCB", "place components", "route traces"
- User is working with `.kicad_pcb` files
- User asks about placement, routing, copper pours, vias
- Project has schematic but no PCB layout
- User mentions DFM, trace width, or clearance

## Context Requirements

**Requires:**
- `hardware/*.kicad_sch` - Completed schematic with netlist
- `docs/component-selections.md` - Component details
- `docs/design-constraints.json` - Board size, layer count, etc.
- `datasheets/` - For placement/routing recommendations

**Produces:**
- `hardware/*.kicad_pcb` - KiCad PCB file
- `docs/pcb-status.md` - Layout progress tracking

## Workflow

### 1. Load Context
```
@docs/design-constraints.json
@docs/component-selections.md
@docs/schematic-status.md
@datasheets/ (for placement guidance)
```

### 1.5 Pre-Layout Validation

**Before starting layout, verify:**

| Check | Source | Action if Missing |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Schematic ERC clean | schematic-status.md | Complete schematic first |
| Layer count decided | design-constraints.json | See `LAYER-COUNT-DECISION.md` |
| Stackup selected | design-constraints.json | See `STACKUP-DECISION.md` |
| Board dimensions | design-constraints.json | Define constraints |
| Critical interfaces | design-constraints.json | USB, SPI speeds, etc. |
| Thermal budget | design-constraints.json | Power dissipation known |

**Extract key constraints:**
```json
{
  "board": {
    "layers": 4,
    "thickness": 1.6,
    "dimensions": {"width": 50, "height": 40}
  },
  "dfmTargets": {
    "manufacturer": "JLCPCB",
    "minTraceWidth": 0.15,
    "minClearance": 0.15,
    "impedanceControl": true
  },
  "interfaces": {
    "usb": true,
    "highSpeedSpi": false
  },
  "thermal": {
    "maxPowerDissipation": 2.5
  }
}
```

**Architecture Validation Warnings:**

| Condition | Warning |
|-----------|---------|
| USB + 2-layer board | Cannot achieve 90Ω impedance |
| Buck converter + no ground plane | EMI issues likely |
| WiFi/BLE + 2-layer | Antenna performance degraded |
| High-speed SPI (>20MHz) + long traces | Signal integrity risk |
| No thermal plan + >1W dissipation | Thermal issues likely |

### 2. Initialize PCB
1. Create PCB file or open existing
2. Import netlist from schematic
3. Set board outline per constraints
4. Configure layer stackup
5. Set design rules

### 3. Configure Design Rules
Set rules appropriate for manufacturer:

```
JLCPCB standard:
- Min trace width: 0.127mm (5mil)
- Min clearance: 0.127mm (5mil)
- Min via drill: 0.3mm
- Min via annular ring: 0.13mm
```

### 4. Place Components

**Priority order:**
1. **Fixed position items** - Connectors (edge), mounting holes
2. **MCU/Main IC** - Central location
3. **Crystal/oscillator** - Within 5mm of MCU
4. **Power components** - Near input, thermal considerations
5. **Decoupling capacitors** - Adjacent to IC power pins
6. **Sensitive analog** - Away from noisy digital
7. **Remaining components** - Grouped by function

See `reference/PLACEMENT-STRATEGY.md` for detailed guidelines.

### 5. Route Critical Signals First

**Priority:**
1. Power delivery (wide traces, pours)
2. Crystal/oscillator (short, guarded)
3. USB differential pairs (90Ω impedance)
4. High-speed signals (length matching)
5. Sensitive analog (away from digital)
6. General signals

See `reference/ROUTING-RULES.md` for trace width and clearance guidelines.

### 6. Create Copper Pours
- GND pour on bottom layer (2-layer)
- Or GND on layer 2, power on layer 3 (4-layer)
- Thermal relief on pads
- Stitch vias for plane continuity

### 7. Route Remaining Signals
- Follow schematic groupings
- Minimize vias
- Avoid acute angles (use 45°)
- Keep trace lengths reasonable

### 8. DRC Check
- Run design rule check
- Fix violations
- Document intentional exceptions

### 9. Visual Review
- Generate board images
- Check silkscreen readability
- Verify component orientation marks
- Review for manufacturing issues

### 10. Pre-Manufacturing Review

**Validation checklist before ordering:**

| Category | Check | Reference |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| DRC | 0 errors, 0 warnings | `DRC-VIOLATIONS-GUIDE.md` |
| Clearances | Meet manufacturer minimums | `DFM-RULES.md` |
| Via sizes | Drill ≥ 0.3mm (JLCPCB std) | `DFM-RULES.md` |
| Annular rings | ≥ 0.13mm (1oz copper) | `DFM-RULES.md` |
| Trace widths | Power traces sized for current | `ROUTING-RULES.md` |
| USB traces | 90Ω impedance, length matched | `HIGH-SPEED-ROUTING.md` |
| Silkscreen | Not on pads, readable | Visual check |
| Board outline | Closed shape, proper clearance | `DFM-RULES.md` |

**Thermal verification:**
- [ ] Power components have thermal relief
- [ ] Thermal vias under QFN/thermal pads
- [ ] Heat sink areas connected to copper pour
- [ ] No thermal bottlenecks (narrow traces for high current)

**Signal integrity verification:**
- [ ] High-speed signals over solid ground
- [ ] Return paths not broken by splits
- [ ] Crystal area guarded, no traces crossing
- [ ] Antenna keep-out respected (if applicable)
