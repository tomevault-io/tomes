# Fragno Integration

Note: All file paths referenced in this document are relative to this `SKILL.md` file.

## Overview

Fragno is a framework-agnostic, type-safe full-stack TypeScript toolkit that enables building
portable full-stack libraries called "fragments". Fragments include backend routes, (optional)
client hooks and (optional) database integration.

Important: Before integrating any first-party fragment, fetch the published docs with `curl` when
they exist. Use the search endpoint to find the right page, then fetch the full Markdown docs. For
fragments that do not yet have published Markdown docs (currently Pi, Resend, and GitHub App), use
this skill's local reference files plus the package README and repo examples.

- `curl -s "https://fragno.dev/api/search?query=forms"`
- `curl -L "https://fragno.dev/docs/forms/quickstart" -H "accept: text/markdown"`

This skill will aid you to integrate a Fragment into an application. To do this we have to mount the
Fragment's backend routes, migrate/generate the database schema, and initialize the client-side
hooks.

## Example user request

### "Integrate the Forms fragment into the application."

In this case you will first start by reading the Forms fragment specific reference file.

## High-level Workflow

1. Install the Fragment
2. Mount the Fragment's backend routes
3. Initialize the client-side hooks
4. (Optionally) Database integration
5. (Optionally) Setup middleware for Fragment-defined routes (based on the user's authentication
   system)
6. (Optionally) Create a custom fetcher for the Fragment (e.g. for authentication headers)
7. Integrate the Fragment into frontend and backend where it makes sense

## Integration Workflow

### 1. Install the Fragment Package

Install the Fragment package via the user's npm-compatible package manager.

### 2. Create a Server-Side Fragment Instance

1. Find the most logical place, usually a central module in the application. If the user is already
   using Fragments, follow the same patterns.
2. Find the Fragment's main entrypoint function, e.g.
   `import { createFormsFragment } from "@fragno-dev/forms";`
3. Pass the Fragment-specific config (API keys, callbacks, etc.)
4. Determine if the Fragment needs a database: this is the case when the main function requires a
   `DatabaseAdapter` parameter.

### 3. Initialize the Database (If Required)

1. Determine the user's database system (should be any of the following, otherwise tell the user
   that installation WILL NOT be possible):
   - PostgreSQL (or PGLite), MySQL, SQLite (or Cloudflare Durable Objects)
   - Kysely, Drizzle, Prisma, (or no ORM)
2. Install `@fragno-dev/db` and `@fragno-dev/cli`.
3. Create a `databaseAdapter` in a central place.
   1. Import Dialect from `@fragno-dev/db/dialects`
   2. Import DriverConfig from `@fragno-dev/db/drivers`
4. Determine the method of migration generation:
   - For Drizzle and Prisma, schemas can be generated for use with the ORM's own migration tool.
   - For Kysely or no ORM, SQL migrations can be generated for use with the Fragno CLI.
5. Use the Fragno CLI to generate the schema file or migrations: (note that input can be more than
   one file)
   - `npx fragno-cli db generate lib/comment-fragment-server.ts --output migrations/001.sql`
   - `npx fragno-cli db generate lib/comment-fragment-server.ts --format drizzle --output schema/fragno-schema.ts`
   - `npx fragno-cli db generate lib/comment-fragment-server.ts --format prisma --output prisma/schema/fragno.prisma`
6. Integrate the schema with the ORM (e.g. by updating the Drizzle config)

### 4. Mount the Fragment's Backend Routes

Fragment's use web standard Request/Response objects, so they can be mounted in any framework that
supports them. There is also the framework-specific `handlersFor` function.

1. Determine what the Fragment's mount route is. The default is usually `/api/${fragmentName}`.
2. Determine the framework-specific way to mount the backend routes in the right location (example
   below)

Next.js example:

```ts title="app/api/example-fragment/[...all]/route.ts"
// This uses the Next.js file-based routing pattern.
import { createExampleFragmentInstance } from "@/lib/example-fragment-server";

const exampleFragment = createExampleFragmentInstance();
export const { GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE } = exampleFragment.handlersFor("next-js");
```

React Router v7 (Remix) example:

```ts title="app/routes/api/example-fragment.tsx"
import type { Route } from "./+types/example-fragment";
import { createExampleFragmentInstance } from "@/lib/example-fragment-server";

export async function loader({ request }: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  return await createExampleFragmentInstance().handler(request);
}

export async function action({ request }: Route.ActionArgs) {
  return await createExampleFragmentInstance().handler(request);
}
```

For Node.js (Express/Node.js) a separate package is required: `@fragno-dev/node`.

### 5. Create a Client-Side Integration

1. Create a client-side integration module in a central location.
2. Import the client creator from the fragment's **framework-specific export** (e.g. `/react`,
   `/vue`, `/svelte`, `/solid`, `/vanilla`).
3. If the backend routes are mounted on a non-default path, pass `mountRoute` to the client creator:
   ```typescript
   ...
   export const exampleFragment = createExampleFragmentClient({
      baseUrl: "/",
      mountRoute: "/custom/api/example-fragment",
   });
   ```
4. Use the fragment hooks/composables in UI components.

### 6. Optional steps

1. Create Fragno Fragment-specific route middleware to implement authentication (or other features).
   See `./references/middleware.md`.
2. Create a custom fetcher for the Fragment (e.g. for authentication headers). See
   `./references/client-customization.md`.
3. Configure a durable hooks dispatcher for fragments that use durable hooks (background retries,
   scheduled hooks). See `./references/dispatchers.md`.

### 7. Present options to user

- Determine what frontend hooks are available
- Determine what backend routes are available
- Determine what service methods are available

Present these to the user to come up with a plan for further deep integration into their
application.
