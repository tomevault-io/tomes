Use this skill only for Phase 2 solver and guidance optimization.

1. Read `solver/evaluate.py` carefully before proposing edits.
2. Infer what the evaluator is rewarding, penalizing, or constraining.
3. Identify the smallest high-leverage changes to `solver/candidate.py` and any supporting guidance notes.
4. Prefer concrete task-specific improvements over process commentary.
5. Keep edits local and score-oriented.
