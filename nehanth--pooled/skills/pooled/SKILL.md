# Pooled room

When the model is `pooled/...`, answers come from a Pooled room: this machine and the user's other
devices (Macs, PCs, phones) each hold part of the model on their GPUs and talk over WebRTC.

## Checking the room

- The user runs `/pooled` in the chat to see the room: devices, how much memory each lends, whether
  they hold the model, who is waiting to join, and the model download. You can't run it for them.
- `/pooled allow` lets a waiting device in, `/pooled deny` turns it away, `/pooled link` shows the
  invite link, `/pooled pledge <GB>` changes how much GPU memory this machine lends.
- For details, read `pooled/status.json` in the OpenClaw state directory (`$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`,
  default `~/.openclaw`): the room code, the model, the devices and their layers, who is waiting,
  and recent events. Its `link` field holds the room's invite key: never repeat it in the chat. Tell
  the user to run `/pooled link` instead.
- Never read or print `pooled/room.json`: it holds the room's keys and passes.

## "Pooled" notices

Messages that start with **Pooled**, the room code and a few words (`**Pooled** · \`4TK-G9P\` ·
waiting for devices`) come from the room, not the model. Older versions started them with
`⚠️ Pooled:`. Tell the user what they say and what to do:

- waiting for the host to let this device in: the host runs `/pooled allow`, or the user joins with
  the invite link instead of the code;
- waiting for devices, or not enough memory: another device joins (open the invite link on it), or
  a device lends more with `/pooled pledge <GB>`;
- downloading the model: wait, then ask again;
- a device left while it held layers: the room waits for it, then deals the layers again;
- the host doesn't allow API clients, or runs an older Pooled: the room's host has to change that.

When the conversation outgrows the room's context, OpenClaw compacts it and asks again.

## Don'ts

- Don't change `plugins.entries.pooled.config` or restart the gateway unless the user asks. Setup is
  `openclaw onboard`, then pick Pooled.
- Small models (the Qwen3 1.7B) are slow with OpenClaw's prompts and tools. If turns are slow or
  loop, suggest the Qwen3.6 35B MoE when the user's devices can hold it.
