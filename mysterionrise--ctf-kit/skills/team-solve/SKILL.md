# CTF Team Solve

Orchestrate a team of 3 specialized teammates to solve a CTF challenge in parallel.

## When to Use

Use this when:

- A challenge is complex or multi-layered
- Initial triage shows mixed signals or low confidence
- You want to try multiple approaches simultaneously
- Time pressure demands parallel investigation
- The challenge has multiple files or stages

Do NOT use when:

- The challenge is straightforward (single encoding, obvious category)
- You already know exactly what tool to run
- Agent teams are not enabled

## Prerequisites

Agent teams must be enabled. Verify `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is set in `.claude/settings.json` or environment.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Triage the Challenge

Run the triage pipeline first to determine the category:

```bash
bash scripts/triage-for-team.sh $ARGUMENTS
```

Or use the analyze skill's triage:

```bash
# From the ctf-kit plugin
bash scripts/triage.sh $ARGUMENTS
```

Read the JSON output. Key fields: `category`, `confidence`, `secondary_categories`.

### Step 2: Decide Team Composition

Based on triage results, select the appropriate 3-teammate composition from the category tables below. If triage shows mixed signals (confidence < 70% or multiple secondary categories), use the **Cross-Category Team** composition.

### Step 3: Spawn the Team

Create an agent team with 3 teammates. For each teammate:

1. **Name** them by role (e.g., "rsa-specialist", "hash-cracker")
2. **Set the prompt** using the role description and the challenge context
3. **Set plan approval** for teammates using offensive tools (web, pwn, osint)
4. **Create initial tasks** in the shared task list — one per teammate

Example spawn prompt to the lead:

```text
Create an agent team with 3 teammates to solve this crypto challenge.

Teammate 1 — "classical-analyst":
  Focus on classical ciphers and encoding chains.
  Tools: frequency analysis, dcode.fr patterns, CyberChef recipes.
  Start by running: bash scripts/identify-hash.sh and bash scripts/run-decode.sh

Teammate 2 — "rsa-specialist":
  Focus on RSA and asymmetric crypto attacks.
  Tools: RsaCtfTool, openssl, sage/python for math.
  Start by extracting any RSA parameters (n, e, c, p, q).

Teammate 3 — "symmetric-cracker":
  Focus on XOR, AES, and hash cracking.
  Tools: xortool, hashcat, john.
  Start by running: bash scripts/run-xortool.sh on any binary files.

Each teammate should broadcast findings to others when they discover something
that changes the understanding of the challenge. If a teammate finds a flag,
broadcast immediately and all teammates should verify.
```

### Step 4: Coordinate

- **Let teammates self-claim tasks** after their initial assignment
- **Monitor progress** — check in if a teammate is stuck for more than a few minutes
- **Broadcast discoveries** — tell a teammate to broadcast when they find something that shifts the approach
- **Synthesize** — once 2+ teammates have findings, combine and identify the solution path
- **Shut down early** — if one teammate solves it, shut down the others

## Communication Patterns

### When teammates should broadcast

- Found a flag or flag fragment
- Discovered a new file or layer (e.g., extracted an embedded file)
- Identified the challenge type with high confidence
- Hit a dead end — other teammates should deprioritize this approach
- Found a password, key, or credential that others might need

### When the lead should intervene

- Two teammates are pursuing the same approach (redirect one)
- A teammate has been stuck for >3 minutes
- New information changes the strategy (reassign tasks)
- One teammate solved it (shut down others)

## Permissions Model

### Tier 1 — Auto-allow (local analysis)

All teammates get these automatically:

```text
file, strings, xxd, binwalk, foremost, exiftool, hashid, xortool,
zsteg, steghide, volatility3, tshark, checksec, ropgadget, radare2,
python3, zbarimg, ctf (CLI)
```

### Tier 2 — Plan approval (connects to targets)

Teammates using these tools must have plan approval enabled:

```text
sqlmap, gobuster, ffuf, nikto, pwntools (remote), nmap,
sherlock, theHarvester, curl/wget to targets
```

The lead reviews the plan before the teammate executes.

### Tier 3 — User confirmation (resource-heavy or destructive)

These should prompt the user:

```text
hashcat --gpu (resource-intensive), any write to target systems
```

## Example Full Workflow

```text
User: /ctf-kit:team-solve challenge.zip

Lead:
1. Runs triage → category=crypto, confidence=65%, secondary=stego
2. Low confidence → uses Cross-Category Team
3. Spawns:
   - "crypto-analyst" with crypto skill focus
   - "stego-analyst" with stego skill focus
   - "generalist" running broad analysis
4. Creates tasks:
   - Task 1: Crypto analysis of challenge files (crypto-analyst)
   - Task 2: Stego analysis of any images found (stego-analyst)
   - Task 3: Deep file analysis and strings search (generalist)
5. Generalist finds hidden PNG inside challenge file → broadcasts
6. Stego-analyst claims the PNG → finds LSB-encoded text
7. LSB text is a key → crypto-analyst uses it to decrypt
8. Flag found → broadcast → team shutdown
```
