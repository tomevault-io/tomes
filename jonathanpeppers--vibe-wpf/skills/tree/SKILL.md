# Vibe Visual Tree Skill

This skill retrieves the complete WPF visual tree as JSON, showing all UI elements, their types, names, and hierarchy.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Inspecting the structure of the WPF UI
- Finding element names for automation or testing
- Debugging layout or control hierarchy issues
- Understanding how controls are nested
- Verifying that elements exist in the visual tree

## Prerequisites

The WPF application must be running with the VibeServer extension. Start it with:
```powershell
cd MyWpfApp
dotnet watch run
```

## Usage

Run the script from the repository root:
```powershell
.\.github\skills\vibe-tree\get-tree.ps1
```

## Output

Returns a JSON representation of the visual tree with:
- Element type (e.g., `Button`, `TextBlock`, `Grid`)
- Element name (x:Name attribute)
- Child elements (nested hierarchy)

Example output:
```json
{
  "Type": "MainWindow",
  "Name": "mainWindow",
  "Children": [
    {
      "Type": "Grid",
      "Name": "rootGrid",
      "Children": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Workflow Integration

Use this skill alongside vibe-screenshot to:
1. Capture a screenshot to see the visual appearance
2. Get the tree to understand the element structure
3. Make targeted XAML changes based on element names
