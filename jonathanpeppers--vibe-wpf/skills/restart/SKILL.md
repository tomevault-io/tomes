# Vibe Restart Skill

This skill triggers a restart of the WPF application via dotnet watch, allowing changes to be applied without manually pressing Ctrl+R.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- You've made changes to XAML files that didn't hot reload
- You've made changes to C# code that require a restart
- The application state needs to be reset
- You want to see changes take effect after editing files

## Prerequisites

The WPF application must be running in watch mode with the VibeServer extension:
```powershell
cd MyWpfApp
dotnet watch run
```

**Important**: The `dotnet watch run` process must be running in a separate terminal for the restart to work.

## Usage

Run the script from the repository root:
```powershell
.\.github\skills\vibe-restart\restart-app.ps1
```

## How It Works

1. Sends a shutdown signal to the running app via the `/restart/` endpoint
2. Waits briefly for the app to close
3. Touches `MyWpfApp\App.xaml.cs` to trigger `dotnet watch` to rebuild and restart

## Workflow Integration

Typical iteration workflow:
1. Make XAML or C# changes
2. Run this restart script
3. Wait 2-3 seconds for restart to complete
4. Use vibe-screenshot to verify the changes

Quick iteration command combining restart and screenshot:
```powershell
.\.github\skills\vibe-restart\restart-app.ps1; Start-Sleep -Seconds 3; .\.github\skills\vibe-screenshot\get-screenshot.ps1
```

## Notes

- WPF XAML hot reload is limited and often requires a restart for changes to apply
- The restart is graceful - it allows the app to shut down cleanly before restarting
- If the app is not running, you'll see an error message
