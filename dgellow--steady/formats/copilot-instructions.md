# Steady

OpenAPI 3 mock server built with Deno. Validates SDKs against OpenAPI specs with
clear error attribution (SDK bug vs spec issue).

## Commands

**ALWAYS use the scripts in `scripts/` directory.

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap   # Install dependencies, setup environment
./scripts/test        # Run all tests
./scripts/lint        # Lint code
./scripts/format      # Format code
```

These scripts handle all the necessary flags and environment setup
automatically.

```

**Test specs**: Real-world specs live in `sdk-tests/` (e.g.,
`sdk-tests/cloudflare-python/openapi-spec.yml`). When looking for a spec file,
search the whole repo with glob, not just `test-fixtures/`.

**Submodule**: Run `git submodule update --init` to fetch test fixtures.

## Key Technical Details

**Stack**: Deno 2.x, TypeScript strict mode, no frameworks

**JSON Pointer (RFC 6901)**:

- Only `~0` (tilde) and `~1` (slash) escaping - NO percent encoding
- Percent-decoding happens at URI fragment layer (ref-resolver.ts:171)
- Array indices must be exact: "0", "1", "10" - reject "01", "1.5", "-1"

**JSON Schema**: 91.6% compliance (1151/1257 tests). Missing: `$dynamicRef`,
`$dynamicAnchor`. Full support for `unevaluatedProperties`/`unevaluatedItems`.

**$ref Resolution**: Handles URI fragment encoding. `#/$defs/User%20Name`resolves
to key`"User
Name"` (percent-decoded before JSON Pointer parsing).

## Code Rules

1. **Read before modify** - Never change code you haven't read
2. **No type hacks** - No `as`, no `!` assertions to silence errors
3. **No silent failures** - Never swallow errors or return fake success
4. **Test with red-green** - Write failing test first, then fix
5. **Fail loudly** - Invalid input = error, not silent pass
6. **No hacky solutions** - Use standard libraries (e.g., `@std/cli` for arg
   parsing), don't reinvent the wheel with brittle manual implementations
7. **No chained bash commands** - When running commands (not writing scripts),
   never use `|`, `&&`, or `||`. Run each command as a separate, distinct
   invocation
8. **No em-dashes** - Never use `—` (U+2014) anywhere in the codebase: comments,
   strings, messages, or docs. Em-dashes are non-ASCII and cause ByteString
   crashes when diagnostic messages flow into HTTP headers via `Headers.set()`.
   Use normal punctuation instead (periods, commas, semicolons). Two sentences
   are better than one long sentence joined by an em-dash.
9. **Raw at the edges, structured in the logic** - Parse untyped inputs
   (strings, JSON, HTTP bodies) once at the boundary into a domain type, and
   pass the domain type through all internal logic. Format back to raw form only
   at the outgoing boundary. Never thread a raw string through recursion and
   re-parse or string-concat it inside the logic. If a primitive you need for
   the domain type does not exist, add it to the owning package (e.g. pointer
   manipulation belongs in `@steady/json-pointer`, schema composition in
   `@steady/json-schema`). Never open-code a local helper that duplicates
   something the owning package should provide, and never introduce a second
   implementation of a primitive that already exists. Search the owning package
   first.

## Skills

### /design-review

Review a design/spec document by finding real-world patterns that stress it. Use
with: `/design-review docs/diagnostics-spec.md`

See `.claude/skills/design-review/SKILL.md` for full process.

### /steady-dev

Project context and working conventions. Read this before making changes.

See `.claude/skills/steady-dev/SKILL.md` for architecture, design philosophy,
and common task guides.

### /user-experiment

Simulate being a real SDK developer to find UX friction in Steady. Use with:
`/user-experiment sink-python`

See `.claude/skills/user-experiment/SKILL.md` for the full methodology.

## Investigation Standards

**INVESTIGATE BEFORE IMPLEMENTING**: Always research the correct behavior first.

1. **Research specifications** - Check OpenAPI spec, RFCs, and official docs
2. **Test actual behavior** - Run code to see what happens, don't assume
3. **Verify assumptions** - If uncertain, write a test to confirm behavior
4. **No hand-waving comments** - Don't add comments like "intentional" or
   "future use" without verifying the behavior is correct
5. **No ignore flags as shortcuts** - Never mark tests as `ignore: true` without
   first verifying if the feature actually works

**When behavior is undefined by spec:**

- Research how PHP, Rails, Node.js, and other frameworks handle it
- Document the actual behavior differences
- Make an informed decision and document why
- Consider making it configurable if behavior varies significantly

**Comments must be accurate:**

- Don't claim behavior is "intentional" unless you verified it's correct
- Don't claim something is "for future use" - either use it or remove it
- Comments should explain WHY, not paper over uncertainty

## Testing Approach

**RED-GREEN TESTING IS MANDATORY**: Always write a failing test BEFORE fixing
any issue - bugs, behavioral changes, or improvements found in code review.

1. Write a test that exposes the issue (should fail - RED)
2. Run the test to confirm it fails
3. Implement the fix
4. Run the test to confirm it passes (GREEN)
5. Run all tests to ensure no regressions

This applies to:

- Bug fixes
- Behavioral changes (e.g., fixing RNG determinism)
- Edge case handling improvements
- Any change that modifies observable behavior

```bash
# Run all tests
./scripts/test

# Run specific test file
./scripts/test packages/json-pointer/json-pointer.test.ts

# Run with filter
./scripts/test --filter "RFC 6901"
```

Tests must pass before committing. Use `./scripts/test` to verify.

### Snapshot Testing

Use Deno's built-in snapshot testing for asserting complex structured output.

**File snapshots** (`assertSnapshot`): Store reference values in
`__snapshots__/{test_file}.snap` next to the test file. Requires
`Deno.TestContext` as the first argument.

```ts
import { assertSnapshot } from "@std/testing/snapshot";

Deno.test("example", async (t) => {
  await assertSnapshot(t, { hello: "world", n: 123 });
});
```

**Inline snapshots** (`assertInlineSnapshot`): Store the expected value directly
in the test source as a template literal string. No `TestContext` needed.

```ts
import { assertInlineSnapshot } from "@std/testing/unstable-snapshot";

Deno.test("example", () => {
  assertInlineSnapshot(
    { hello: "world", n: 123 },
    `
{
  hello: "world",
  n: 123,
}
  `,
  );
});
```

**Updating snapshots**: Run tests with `-- --update` to regenerate snapshots
that have changed. For inline snapshots, the test source file itself is
rewritten in place (requires `--allow-read`, `--allow-write`, `--allow-run`).
Pass `-- --update --no-format` to skip `deno fmt` after updating inline
snapshots.

```bash
./scripts/test -- --update
```

**When to use which**: Prefer `assertSnapshot` (file-based) for large or
frequently changing output. Prefer `assertInlineSnapshot` for small values where
seeing the expected value next to the assertion is clearer. Both are already
used in this codebase (see `tests/integration/`).

## Error Messages

Errors must include:

- WHAT failed (specific validation/parsing error)
- WHERE (file:line or JSON path)
- WHY (root cause)
- HOW to fix (actionable suggestion)

## Commit Style

```
fix: Description of bug fix
feat: New feature
docs: Documentation only
test: Test additions/changes
refactor: Code restructuring
```

## Current Status

Working:

- HTTP server with path matching
- JSON Schema validation (runtime-validator.ts)
- Response generation from schemas/examples
- RFC 6901 JSON Pointer operations
- OpenAPI 3.x parsing

Test coverage gaps:

- response-generator.ts (limited tests)
