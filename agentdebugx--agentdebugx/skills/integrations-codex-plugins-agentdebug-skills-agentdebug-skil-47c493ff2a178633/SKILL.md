# AgentDebugX Debug Skill

Use the locally installed `agentdebug` CLI to diagnose the current captured
host session or an explicitly supplied trajectory. Prefer DeepDebug: it is the
advocated AgentDebugX workflow and combines LLM-backed global analysis,
structure-guided localization, candidate adjudication, and fix guidance.

For the current session, run:

```bash
agentdebug run --current --profile deep --json
```

For a supplied trajectory or stored trace ID, run:

```bash
agentdebug run <input> --profile deep --json
```

Deep mode requires configured LLM credentials. Use `quick` only when the user
asks for a fast deterministic check or LLM access is unavailable; use
`standard` when the user explicitly prefers local attribution and guidance.

Read references as needed:

- `references/setup.md` before first use, when `agentdebug` is missing, or
  when LLM-backed diagnosis fails due to missing credentials.
- `references/cli_reference.md` for batch processing, lower-level commands,
  output files, exit codes, LLM configuration, and store usage.
- `references/formats.md` before converting a raw host export or when the
  input format is unclear.
- `references/analysis.md` after diagnosis when interpreting evidence,
  final-answer failures, or confidence.
- `references/recovery.md` when the user wants next-run guidance, repair
  suggestions, verifier ideas, or recovery planning.

## When To Use

Use this skill only when the user explicitly asks for AgentDebug, AgentDebugX,
or the `$agentdebug` skill. Handle generic debugging requests normally.

## Select The Target

- Use `--current` for this agent's current, latest, or just-completed captured
  session. Never substitute the newest trace from the store.
- If `--current` fails because capture is inactive, fall back to the host's own
  transcript instead of stopping. `run` ingests them directly:
  - Codex: the rollout named by `$CODEX_THREAD_ID` under
    `~/.codex/sessions/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/rollout-*-$CODEX_THREAD_ID.jsonl`. This
    identifies the session exactly.
  - Claude Code: `~/.claude/projects/<cwd with each / and . replaced by ->/`,
    which holds one `<session-id>.jsonl` per session for this project. The
    current session is not identified there, so pick the most recently modified
    file, say which file you chose, and ask the user to confirm when more than
    one was written recently.
  Then run `agentdebug run <transcript>.jsonl --profile deep --json`. Say that
  the target came from the transcript rather than a captured trace, and note
  that the in-flight turn may not be flushed yet. Mention that enabling capture
  makes `--current` exact, but do not enable it yourself.
- Use an explicit path or trace ID when supplied. Read `references/formats.md`
  if its format is unclear.
- If a past session is ambiguous, present candidates and ask the user to choose.
- Read `references/cli_reference.md` before processing a collection. A JSONL
  event stream may be one trajectory, so do not infer batch mode from its suffix.
- Use `--profile gui --format osworld` for one OSWorld trajectory. GUI RCA
  collections use the separate `python -m agentdebug.gui` workflow.

Invoke one primary `agentdebug run`. Preserve explicit format, profile,
diagnoser, attributor, or recovery choices. Add `--ui` only when the user asks
for interactive inspection.

## Read The Result

Read `status`, run/trace/report IDs, `resolved_pipeline`,
`candidate_root_cause`, `top_evidence`, `warnings`, and `errors`. Report them
compactly, then interpret the evidence for the user's objective:

```text
Status: <status>
Run: <run_id>
Trace: <trace_id>
Report: <report_id>
Candidate root cause: <summary or unavailable>
Evidence: <top evidence or unavailable>
Warnings/errors: <only when present>
```

Do not dump the full report JSON unless the user asks. Preserve the distinction
between trajectory facts, deterministic findings, LLM conclusions, recovery
proposals, and externally supplied labels.

For a current-session target, frame the diagnosis as self-reflection: identify
what this agent should change in its reasoning, verification, or next attempt.
Do not assume an AgentDebugX or host-framework code defect. For an external or
custom-agent target, connect findings to the relevant agent code, prompt,
skill, tool, or runtime only when the evidence supports that connection.

## Boundaries

- Let `agentdebug run` own ingest, diagnosis, and persistence. Do not invoke
  `ingest` or `diagnose` again after a successful run.
- Do not treat a diagnosis-only request as authorization to retry, patch, or
  mutate. Recovery output is a proposal unless the user asks to apply it.
- Always say "candidate root cause" or "likely" rather than claiming ground
  truth. Heuristic and DeepDebug reports intentionally omit confidence.
