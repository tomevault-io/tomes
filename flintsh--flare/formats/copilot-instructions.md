# Working on Flare

Flare’s documentation is part of the product. A feature is not complete until its
documentation, examples, and relevant visual walkthroughs describe the behavior
that ships. Apply this requirement to **every feature and every commit that changes
observable behavior**, including fixes, removals, defaults, limits, and permissions.
Do not defer documentation to another task or release.

## Documentation location and boundaries

- The public handbook lives in `docs/site/`, an independently built VitePress site.
- Keep it in this repository so implementation and documentation ship together.
- Preserve automatic version/commit provenance on every page and in
  `build-info.json`. Never hardcode a release label or conceal uncommitted changes.
- Preserve the handbook’s creator credit linking to `https://fl1nt.dev`, its
  official 88×31 button, and xNefas’s icon attribution. Follow the
  [credit and asset guidance](docs/site/contributing.md#project-credits-and-the-author-button).
- The existing `docs/*.md` files are historical engineering notes and linked
  references. Keep any affected live references accurate; put new public guidance
  in the handbook, and cross-link rather than create a second canonical guide.
- Keep docs tooling out of Flare’s runtime dependencies and Docker image. Run
  `npm ci --prefix docs/site`; the docs have their own lockfile.
- Do not commit generated site output, dependency directories, copied screenshots,
  copied recordings, or caches. `prepare-assets.mjs` generates optimized assets
  from the existing source assets. Add only new visual evidence that is necessary.

## Required workflow for every change

1. **Map the impact before coding.** Read the current relevant guide and actual
   implementation. Identify affected personas (user, administrator, operator,
   integration author), defaults, access rules, failure cases, configuration,
   migrations, API requests/responses, and webhook events.
2. **Implement and document together.** Update all affected handbook pages in the
   same commit as the behavior change. Include what people can do, where to find
   controls, steps, expected results, important limits, and recovery instructions.
   Explain changes to existing installations and old integrations, not just fresh
   setup. Remove obsolete instructions. Update the feature explorer and sidebar
   when a capability or page is added, moved, or removed.
3. **Update executable contracts.** API changes require the endpoint inventory,
   relevant API guide, `public/openapi.json`, working request examples, and any
   affected request-builder controls. Webhook changes also require the event JSON
   Schema, signing examples, retry/ordering/deduplication guidance, and operator
   settings. Never imply named tokens authorize session-only or admin endpoints.
4. **Show real behavior.** If a visible workflow changes, capture or refresh its
   screenshots and/or recording using the real rendered application with isolated
   demonstration data. Inspect every image for stale controls, credentials, and
   private data. Update the tour/lab/feature explorer if affected. Label simulations
   as simulations. Do not fabricate app screenshots or present a simulation as a
   real server operation. Supply useful alt text and written video transcripts.
5. **Validate before committing or shipping.** Run the checks below, inspect changed
   pages at desktop and mobile sizes, follow important links, and actually execute
   changed commands/API examples against disposable fixtures when feasible. Build
   under a non-root base path too when changing navigation or assets. Review the
   docs diff against the implementation diff. No placeholder pages or TODO-only
   instructions count as coverage.
6. **Report the evidence.** In the PR or final delivery, name the affected guides,
   examples, visual evidence, and checks. Include real limitations. For changes
   with no user-visible effect, explain that conclusion in the PR and verify the
   relevant docs still match; do not make meaningless prose edits just to satisfy
   a check. The CI coverage gate still requires review of affected documentation
   areas for source changes; a short useful clarification or source verification
   note can record that review.

## Coverage matrix

| Change                                                                | Required documentation review/update                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Uploads, previews, sharing, files, tags, folders, pastes, short links | Relevant `guide/` pages, feature explorer, screenshots/tour, affected API references                        |
| Profile or account behavior, tools, preferences                       | Relevant `guide/` pages; token and email references where relevant                                          |
| Setup, instance settings, branding, access, moderation                | Relevant `admin/` pages; deployment and user guides if behavior crosses personas                            |
| Storage, runtime, Docker, proxy, migrations, environment, workers     | Relevant `hosting/` pages, defaults/precedence, backup/restore/upgrade guidance                             |
| HTTP route, auth, DTO, token scopes                                   | `api/endpoint-inventory.md`, relevant `api/` guide, OpenAPI, example client; relevant access/privacy guides |
| Webhook events, delivery policy, signatures, queues                   | `api/webhooks.md`, event schema, receiver example, configuration and operations                             |
| Any new capability                                                    | `features.md` / `FeatureExplorer.vue`, discoverable navigation, practical guide and visual evidence         |

These are overlapping requirements. A single feature can need changes in every
area. CI checks presence and structural consistency; **the agent remains responsible
for complete semantic coverage**, including behavior that a path-based check misses.

## Checks

### Local visual testing with Meticulous

Flare no longer uses Meticulous CI or paid hosted test runs. Keep the Meticulous
CLI, installed skills, recorder support, and disposable test image available for
local visual testing. For frontend changes, use the local simulation and diff
steps automatically when suitable recorded sessions are available; see the
[visual testing guide](docs/site/contributing.md#local-visual-testing-with-meticulous).

Repository policy takes precedence over the installed skills' cloud-test steps:
do not upload builds, trigger hosted test runs, ensure cloud baselines, or wait for
a Meticulous CI check unless the user explicitly asks to re-enable hosted testing.
Use `meticulous simulate` against the local app for relevant sessions, inspect the
screenshots/diffs, and fix unintended changes. A simulation without a base replay
is a visual inspection, not a verified zero-diff result. If authentication, session
access, or service limits prevent simulation, use available local browser tests
and report the coverage gap; do not fall back to a paid run. Local simulations
still require Meticulous authentication and network access and upload replay
artifacts to the service; do not treat them as offline tests.

### Documentation checks

```sh
npm ci --prefix docs/site
npm run check:coverage --prefix docs/site
npm run build --prefix docs/site
# First browser-test run on a machine:
cd docs/site
npx playwright install chromium
npm test
```

`check:coverage` compares every implemented API route to the endpoint inventory,
named-token routes to OpenAPI operations/scopes, supported environment variables
to the configuration reference, and the canonical webhook schema to its download.
CI also runs `check:changes -- --base <base SHA>` to require documentation changes
in the appropriate areas for the code diff. `build` rejects broken internal links,
anchors, missing assets, and invalid OpenAPI references. Use repository tests
appropriate to the implementation change in addition to these docs checks.

## Writing and examples

- Write for the person doing the task. Use real UI labels and exact routes/options.
- Verify against source, not memory or marketing copy. Document actual defaults,
  inheritance, units, roles, visibility rules, and limitations explicitly.
- Keep secrets out of URLs, screenshots, committed examples, and browser storage.
  Use environment variables/placeholders. Do not add real network calls to the
  docs playground without an explicitly designed and reviewed security model.
- Prefer a runnable minimal example followed by options and troubleshooting.
- Keep cross-links relative or base-aware. Use `withBase` for Vue-rendered links
  and assets. The site must work at `/` and under a repository subpath.
- Follow [the docs contribution guide](docs/site/contributing.md) for publishing,
  asset handling, testing, and the definition of complete coverage.
