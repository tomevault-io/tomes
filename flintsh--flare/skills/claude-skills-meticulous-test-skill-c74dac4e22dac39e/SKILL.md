description: Run a Meticulous test run after implementing a frontend change, then hand off to the `meticulous-review` skill to classify each visual change as intended or unintended. Uploads the build once — the same build can be re-triggered against different bases without rebuilding — and it works with uncommitted changes. Use when implementing a feature autonomously end-to-end before creating a PR. Use when this capability is needed.

To test a frontend change using Meticulous, follow the workflow below step by step, using the CLI or MCP commands as described.

> Before starting, run the `meticulous-cli-update` skill to ensure the Meticulous CLI and skills are up to date — unless it has already run earlier in this conversation, in which case skip it.

If you are already given a test run id, skip to Step 4.

## Step 1 -- Build the frontend

1. Find out what build artefact Meticulous expects by checking your CI config for the corresponding step:
   - GitHub: `.github/workflows/*.yml` for `uses: alwaysmeticulous/report-diffs-action/upload-assets@v1` (build assets) or `upload-container@v1` (docker image)
   - GitLab: `.gitlab-ci.yml` (or an included `.gitlab/ci/*.yml`) for `npx @alwaysmeticulous/cli ci upload-assets` (build assets) or `ci upload-container` (docker image)
   - Bitbucket: `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` for the same `npx @alwaysmeticulous/cli ci upload-assets` / `ci upload-container` step
2. Build the frontend following the same instructions as used in that CI config.

## Step 2 -- Upload the build

Register the build as a reusable deployment with `agent upload-build`. This uploads the artefact and prints a `deploymentId` to stdout — it does **not** trigger a run yet.

```bash
# CLI
meticulous agent upload-build --appDirectory <path-to-build>     # assets
meticulous agent upload-build --localImageTag <image-tag>        # container

# MCP (not 1:1 — request an upload URL, upload the artifact yourself, then register it)
request_asset_upload(size=<zipByteSize>)      # or request_container_upload() — no required args
# ... upload the zip/image to the returned URL/registry yourself ...
register_asset_build(uploadId="<id>", commitSha="<sha>")      # or register_container_build(uploadId="<id>", commitSha="<sha>")
```

- `--appDirectory` points to the build output directory (e.g. a `dist/` subfolder); `--localImageTag` is the local Docker image tag. The build mode is auto-detected.
- The build's commit defaults to the local git HEAD. If the working tree is dirty, it is captured as an **ephemeral commit** (printed as `commitSha (local, ephemeral due to dirty working tree): …`) — see the uncommitted-changes note below.
- Untracked files are rejected (they can't be captured) — `git add` them first.
- Capture the `deploymentId` from stdout (pass `--verbose` to also see progress on stderr).

## Step 3 -- Trigger a test run

Trigger a run for the deployment, comparing against a base. Run it from the repo directory to infer both the base (merge-base with the origin default branch) and the git diff automatically:

```bash
# CLI
meticulous agent trigger-test-run --deploymentId <deploymentId>

# MCP (never infers `baseSha`/`gitDiffOutput` — pass them explicitly — and always returns immediately without waiting for the run to finish)
trigger_test_run(deploymentId="<deploymentId>", baseSha="<sha>")
```

- A base is **required**. It's auto-inferred from the current directory, or pass `--baseSha <sha>` (and optionally `--gitDiffOutput`) to set it explicitly.
- Omit `--deploymentId` to use the most recent deployment already uploaded for the local HEAD commit instead — this requires a clean working tree (no uncommitted changes).
- The command **blocks until the run finishes** by default and prints the `testRunId` to stdout; the final status is `Failure` when visual differences were detected (a normal completed verdict, not an error). Pass `--dontWaitForTestRunToComplete` to return as soon as the run is triggered.
- **One build, many bases:** the same `deploymentId` can be re-triggered against different bases — just run `agent trigger-test-run` again with a different `--baseSha`. No rebuild or re-upload needed.

Note the `testRunId` from the output.

## Step 4 -- Review the visual changes

Follow the `meticulous-review` skill, passing the `testRunId` from Step 3. It fetches the diff summary, inspects representative screenshots / DOM diffs / timelines, and produces a final report classifying each visual change as intended or unintended.

> **Uncommitted changes:** if you built/tested with a dirty working tree, the run is recorded against an ephemeral commit that is not your HEAD (and isn't pushed). Commands that resolve a run from the local checkout — `meticulous-review` / `agent test-run-diffs` run with no `--testRunId` — won't find it by commit, so **always pass the explicit `--testRunId`** to the review step in that case.
