# Gas Compare

Compare per-test gas between the current branch and a base branch.

## When to Use

- Before opening a PR, to check gas impact of your changes
- After refactoring router/executor/vault code
- To benchmark gas improvements across protocol integrations
- To catch gas regressions early

## Prerequisites

- `forge` installed (Foundry)
- Repo must be a git repository with a `crates/tycho-execution/contracts/` directory containing `foundry.toml`
- `RPC_URL` environment variable or `crates/tycho-execution/contracts/.env` file (auto-loaded). Required — most tests fork mainnet. The script will error if missing.
- **Run from the repo root** (not from `crates/tycho-execution/contracts/`). The script auto-detects the foundry dir.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine parameters

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- `--base-branch <branch>`: base branch to compare against (default: `main`)
- `--save`: save the report to `crates/tycho-execution/.gas-compare/` in the repo

If no arguments, use defaults.

### Step 2: Ensure test_metadata.json exists

Check whether `crates/tycho-execution/.gas-compare/test_metadata.json` exists in the repo root.

**If it exists**: proceed to Step 3.

**If it does not exist**: build it now by reading each high-level router test file in `crates/tycho-execution/contracts/test/`:
- `TychoRouterSingleSwap.t.sol`
- `TychoRouterSequentialSwap.t.sol`
- `TychoRouterSplitSwap.t.sol`
- `TychoRouterFees.t.sol`
- `TychoRouterVault.t.sol`
- `TychoRouterProtocolIntegration.t.sol`

For each `function test...` in these files, record:
- `"test"`: the function name
- `"file"`: the filename (not the full path)
- `"router_function"`: the TychoRouter entry-point called — one of `singleSwap`, `singleSwapPermit2`, `singleSwapUsingVault`, `sequentialSwap`, `sequentialSwapPermit2`, `sequentialSwapUsingVault`, `splitSwap`, `splitSwapPermit2`, `splitSwapUsingVault`, `exposedSplitSwap`, `exposedSequentialSwap`
- `"protocols"`: sorted, deduplicated list of protocol names used — infer from executor variable names (`usv2Executor` → `UniswapV2`, `usv3Executor` → `UniswapV3`, `usv4Executor` → `UniswapV4`, `balancerv2Executor` → `BalancerV2`, `balancerv3Executor` → `BalancerV3`, `curveExecutor` → `Curve`, `ekuboExecutor` → `Ekubo`, `rocketpoolExecutor` → `Rocketpool`, `bebopExecutor` → `Bebop`, `erc4626Executor` → `ERC4626`, `wethExecutor` → `WETH`) or from calldata file names loaded via `loadCallDataFromFile`
- `"skipped"`: `true` if the test uses `vm.skip(true)` (omit otherwise)

Exclude:
- Tests that contain `vm.expectRevert` — error-path tests, not benchmarks
- Tests that do not call any router entry-point (pure admin/config tests, vault deposit/pause tests, and tests in `TychoRouter.t.sol` that only test access control)

Write the result to `crates/tycho-execution/.gas-compare/test_metadata.json` in this format:

```json
{
  "last_updated": "<today's date>",
  "note": "High-level TychoRouter swap tests only. Excluded: tests that expect a revert, admin/config tests, vault deposit/pause tests, and GasTest.t.sol.",
  "tests": [
    {
      "test": "testSingleSwapPermit2",
      "file": "TychoRouterSingleSwap.t.sol",
      "router_function": "singleSwapPermit2",
      "protocols": ["UniswapV2"]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

We assume protocols have not changed between branches, so there is no need to regenerate this file when switching to the base branch for comparison.

### Step 3: Run the comparison

The script runs `forge test --gas-report --json --match-test <testName>` **one test at a time**. For each test, it extracts the gas for the specific router function that test calls. This gives the exact gas cost of the swap — no setUp or test body overhead (deal, approve, assertions).

This is slower than running all tests at once (~5-10 minutes per branch for ~40 tests), but produces accurate per-test gas.

```bash
python3 <skill_dir>/scripts/gas_compare.py \
    --foundry-dir ./crates/tycho-execution/contracts \
    --metadata crates/tycho-execution/.gas-compare/test_metadata.json \
    --base-branch main \
    --save-json crates/tycho-execution/.gas-compare \
    --output crates/tycho-execution/.gas-compare/report.md
```

This will:
1. For each test in test_metadata.json, run `forge test --gas-report --json --match-test <testName>` on the current branch
2. Create a temporary git worktree for the base branch
3. Run the same per-test gas collection in the worktree
4. Clean up the worktree
5. Generate a per-test comparison report

If per-test results have already been saved (`crates/tycho-execution/.gas-compare/*.json`), reuse them:

```bash
# Reuse saved results (skip re-running tests)
python3 <skill_dir>/scripts/gas_compare.py \
    --current crates/tycho-execution/.gas-compare/current_branch.json \
    --base crates/tycho-execution/.gas-compare/main.json \
    --metadata crates/tycho-execution/.gas-compare/test_metadata.json \
    --output crates/tycho-execution/.gas-compare/report.md
```

**Important**: Saved JSON files are now `{testName: gas}` dicts. Old format files (arrays from `--gas-report --json` bulk runs, or objects from `forge test --json`) are incompatible — delete them and re-run.

### Step 4: Present the gas report

Read the generated markdown report, then **rewrite it for the user** following the presentation rules below. Do NOT just paste the raw report — curate it.

#### Report structure

The report has two sections:

1. **Summary table** (top): Mean gas per router function, aggregated from per-test data. Columns: `Function | Main (mean) | Branch (mean) | Diff`.

2. **Per-file tables**: One table per test source file. Each row is one test. Columns: `Test | Router Function | Protocols | Main | Branch | Diff`. Sorted alphabetically by test name within each file. Skipped tests omitted.

#### How to present

Show the **summary table first** with actual gas values (not percentages). After the summary table, add a one-line **Pattern** summary describing the trend (e.g., "All entry points increase ~3-10k due to added balance checks.").

Then show the **per-file tables** exactly as generated — one section heading per file, one row per test.

End with a **Summary** paragraph: what the overall gas impact is, what areas improved, what areas regressed, and why (based on the branch name and what changed).

#### Example output format

```
## Gas Comparison: `my-branch` vs `main`

## Summary (mean per router function)

| Function | Main (mean) | Branch (mean) | Diff |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| singleSwap | 285,753 | 291,543 | +5,790 |
| singleSwapPermit2 | 333,180 | 336,036 | +2,856 |
| sequentialSwap | 369,795 | 374,406 | +4,611 |
...

**Pattern**: All entry points increase ~3-10k. Permit2 variants show smaller increases.

### TychoRouterSingleSwap.t.sol

| Test | Router Function | Protocols | Main | Branch | Diff |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| testSingleSwapIntegration | singleSwap | UniswapV2 | 283,456 | 289,246 | +5,790 |
| testSingleSwapPermit2 | singleSwapPermit2 | UniswapV2 | 333,180 | 336,036 | +2,856 |
...

### TychoRouterSequentialSwap.t.sol
...

**Summary**: This branch adds balance checks in the dispatcher, costing ~3-10k additional gas per swap.
```

### Step 5: Sanity-check suggestions

After the report, suggest specific `forge test` commands for the largest changes:

```bash
# Verbose gas trace for the biggest regression
forge test --match-test <testName> -vvvv

# Gas snapshot diff
forge snapshot --diff
```

## Options

- `--foundry-dir PATH`: path to the foundry project (auto-detected from cwd)
- `--base-branch BRANCH`: branch to compare against (default: `main`)
- `--metadata PATH`: path to test_metadata.json (default: `crates/tycho-execution/.gas-compare/test_metadata.json`)
- `--current FILE`: pre-generated forge test --json for current branch (skip running tests)
- `--base FILE`: pre-generated forge test --json for base branch (skip running tests)
- `--output FILE`: write report to file instead of stdout
- `--save-json DIR`: save raw JSON results for reuse
- `--forge-args ...`: extra arguments passed to `forge test`

## Notes

- Runs `forge test --gas-report --json --match-test <testName>` per test to get exact router function gas
- Gas values are the **router function call only** — no setUp, deal, approve, or assertion overhead
- Each test is run individually (~5-10s each, ~5-10 minutes per branch for ~40 tests)
- The worktree approach means the base branch tests run in an isolated copy — no stashing needed
- The script requires no external Python dependencies (stdlib only)
- Saved JSON format is `{testName: gas}` — old bulk-run formats are incompatible
