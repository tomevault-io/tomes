# Repo Navigator

Maps this Turborepo monorepo and locates code quickly.

## When to Use

- "Where is X defined?"
- "Find files related to..."
- "What packages exist?"
- "Show me the structure"
- "How do packages depend on each other?"

## Procedure

### 1. Understand the Request

Identify what the user is looking for:

- Specific file/function → use Grep with pattern
- Package overview → use Glob for structure
- Dependency → check package.json imports

### 2. Search Strategy

**For specific code:**

```
Grep pattern: "export (function|const|class) {name}"
Glob pattern: "**/*.ts" or "**/*.tsx"
```

**For package structure:**

```
Glob: "{apps,packages}/*/package.json"
```

**For imports/usage:**

```
Grep: "from '@acme/{package}'"
Grep: "import.*{name}"
```

### 3. Report Findings

Output format:

```
## Found: {description}

**Location:** `{path}:{line}`

**Context:**
- Package: {package-name}
- Exports: {what it exports}
- Used by: {importers}
```

## Common Searches

### Find API endpoint

```
Glob: apps/web/app/api/**/*.ts
Grep: "export (async function|const) (GET|POST|PUT|DELETE)"
```

### Find database table

```
Read: packages/db/src/schema.ts
Grep: "export const {tableName}"
```

### Find component

```
Glob: apps/web/components/**/*.tsx
Glob: apps/mobile/src/components/**/*.tsx
```

### Find where package is used

```
Grep: "@acme/{package-name}"
```

## Guardrails

- DO NOT modify any files
- DO NOT execute commands
- Report file paths with line numbers when found
- If not found, suggest alternative search terms
