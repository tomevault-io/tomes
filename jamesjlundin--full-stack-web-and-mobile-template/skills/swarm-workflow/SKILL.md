# Swarm Workflow

Coordinates parallel work across multiple sessions and branches.

## When to Use

- "This is too big for one session"
- "Split this into parallel tasks"
- "How do I swarm this?"
- "Divide and conquer this feature"
- "Parallel development workflow"

## Swarm Strategy

### When to Swarm

- Task touches 5+ unrelated files
- Multiple independent features in one request
- Long-running task risks context overflow
- Work can proceed in parallel without blocking

### When NOT to Swarm

- Simple single-file changes
- Tightly coupled changes that must be atomic
- Exploratory work where scope is unclear
- Tasks requiring deep context continuity

## Branch Strategy

```
main
├── feature/task-a-auth
├── feature/task-b-api
├── feature/task-c-ui
└── feature/integration (merge point)
```

### Naming Convention

```
feature/{task-id}-{short-description}
```

### Merge Order

1. Independent branches merge to integration branch
2. Resolve conflicts in integration
3. Integration branch merges to main

## Procedure

### Step 1: Analyze Task

Break down the request into independent units:

```markdown
## Task Decomposition

### Original Request

{user's request}

### Independent Units

1. **{Unit A}**
   - Files: {list}
   - Dependencies: none
   - Can run parallel: yes

2. **{Unit B}**
   - Files: {list}
   - Dependencies: Unit A types only
   - Can run parallel: yes (with interface)

3. **{Unit C}**
   - Files: {list}
   - Dependencies: Units A and B
   - Must wait for: A, B to complete
```

### Step 2: Define Interfaces

For units that depend on each other, define interfaces first:

```typescript
// Shared interface (commit first)
export interface UserService {
  getUser(id: string): Promise<User>;
  updateUser(id: string, data: Partial<User>): Promise<User>;
}
```

### Step 3: Create Branch Plan

```markdown
## Branch Plan

### Branch 1: feature/task-auth

- Assignee: Session 1
- Files:
  - packages/auth/src/...
  - apps/web/app/api/auth/...
- Tests: packages/tests/src/auth.\*.test.ts
- Definition of Done:
  - [ ] Auth endpoints working
  - [ ] Tests passing
  - [ ] TypeScript compiles

### Branch 2: feature/task-api

- Assignee: Session 2
- Files:
  - apps/web/app/api/users/...
- Tests: packages/tests/src/users.test.ts
- Definition of Done:
  - [ ] CRUD endpoints working
  - [ ] Tests passing
  - [ ] TypeScript compiles

### Merge Gate

- [ ] All branches pass CI
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] Integration tests pass
```

### Step 4: Handoff Instructions

For each branch/session:

```markdown
## Session Handoff: {Branch Name}

### Context

{Brief description of overall task}

### Your Assignment

{Specific work for this session}

### Files to Modify

- {file1}: {what to do}
- {file2}: {what to do}

### Interfaces to Use (Do Not Modify)

- {interface file}

### Definition of Done

1. {criterion 1}
2. {criterion 2}
3. pnpm typecheck passes
4. pnpm lint passes
5. Tests pass

### When Complete

1. Commit with message: "{conventional commit}"
2. Push to branch: {branch-name}
3. Create PR to: feature/integration
```

## Merge Gates

### Before Merge to Integration

- [ ] CI passes on branch
- [ ] No uncommitted changes
- [ ] All DoD criteria met
- [ ] PR reviewed (if required)

### Before Merge to Main

- [ ] All branches merged to integration
- [ ] Conflicts resolved
- [ ] Full test suite passes
- [ ] Integration testing complete

## Guardrails

- ALWAYS define interfaces before parallel work
- NEVER have two branches modify same file
- Commit interfaces first, then implementations
- Each branch must pass CI independently
- Merge frequently to avoid drift
- Document assumptions in PR descriptions
