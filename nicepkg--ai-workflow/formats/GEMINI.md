# AI Workflow Collection - AI Instructions

This is the master repository for curated Claude Code workflow collections.

## Language Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: All `AGENTS.md` files in this project MUST be written in English only. This ensures consistent AI behavior across different language contexts.

- `AGENTS.md` - English only (AI instructions)
- `README.md` - English (primary)
- `README_cn.md` - Chinese translation (optional)

## Available Skills

### workflow-creator
**Trigger**: "create workflow", "new workflow", "set up workflow", "build a xxx-workflow"

Creates complete workflow directories with:
- Multi-AI tool support (.claude, .codex, .cursor, .opencode, .agents, .kilocode, .roo, .goose, .gemini, .agent, .github, skills, .factory, .windsurf)
- Curated skills downloaded from GitHub
- README.md (user documentation)
- AGENTS.md (AI instructions)

### skill-creator
**Trigger**: "create skill", "new skill", "build a skill"

Creates new skills following Anthropic's specification.

## Workflow Creation Process

When user requests a new workflow:

1. **Create directory** using `workflow-creator/scripts/create_workflow.py` (default target: `workflows/`)
2. **Select skills** from `workflow-creator/references/skill-sources.md`
3. **Download skills** using `workflow-creator/scripts/download_skill.py`
4. **Generate README.md** for users
5. **Generate AGENTS.md** for AI
6. **Update project README.md** - Add new workflow to the list

## Post-Creation Tasks

After creating any workflow, ALWAYS update the project README.md:

1. Add new workflow to the workflow list table
2. Update workflow count
3. Add brief description
