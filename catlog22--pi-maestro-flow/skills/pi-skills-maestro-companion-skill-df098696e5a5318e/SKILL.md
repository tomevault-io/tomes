<teammate_contract>

- `background: false` is the default. Use foreground dispatch whenever the result determines the current answer or next action.
- Use `background: true` only for independent work. If this turn must consume a background result, call `observe` exactly once with `action: "wait"` and a bounded timeout before continuing; never continue independently while the result is pending.
- Otherwise end the turn and wait for the automatic `teammate-complete` notification. Do not rely on `SendMessage`, `team_msg`, or hook callbacks as completion signals.
- Never silently ignore an unfinished dispatch.

If any required file above was not expanded into context by the host, or its content is no longer in context, Read it explicitly before executing any step.

<purpose>
Minimal-run execution channel. Full LLM capability with one bounded Run and evidence appended to `{run_dir}/evidence/companion-log.md`.

Use when:
- Intent is mechanically clear (no design decisions needed; file count irrelevant)
- No typed artifact consumed by downstream steps
- No gate/verdict needed for lifecycle tracking

Lightweight self-check (all must hold):
- Intent specifies a concrete, bounded action with named target (file, function, error message)
- No typed artifact consumed by downstream steps
- No gate/verdict for lifecycle tracking
- Single concern, no multi-phase span
If self-check fails mid-execution, stop and suggest `/maestro-next` for re-routing.
</purpose>

<context>
$ARGUMENTS — intent text + optional flags.

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `-y` | Skip confirmation, execute directly |

Mode detection: intent → execute | empty → [@ask] user prompt: request intent text; if still empty → display usage hint and exit

Knowledge utilities (note/log/promote) are available via `/maestro-knowledge`.
</context>

<invariants>
1. Execute mode follows the exact Session identity -> bounded Run lifecycle in `run-mode.md`.
2. Evidence is append-only, non-formal (never enters gates or artifact registry)
3. No automatic multi-step orchestration — the command owns exactly one explicit single-step Session chain
</invariants>

<flow>

## Execute (default)

Linear: resolve Session identity -> dispatch Run -> explore -> confirm -> do -> check -> complete Run -> complete Session when the chain is terminal.

### 1. Create

Follow the self-start flow in `run-mode.md`. Negotiate capabilities, then execute the three receipt-chained mutations below. `{open_request_id}`, `{insert_request_id}`, and `{next_request_id}` are distinct stable IDs; use the exact `session_id` and `orchestration_revision` returned by each preceding receipt. Participant and actor are the same authorized identity.

```bash
maestro session open "<intent>" --id <slug> --participant {actor_id} --actor {actor_id} --request-id {open_request_id} --reason "open self-started Companion Session" --json
maestro session chain insert --session {session_id} --step-id {step_id} --command companion --arg "<intent>" --participant {actor_id} --actor {actor_id} --request-id {insert_request_id} --reason "add Companion task" --expected-orchestration-revision {open_orchestration_revision} --json
maestro run next --session {session_id} --participant {actor_id} --actor {actor_id} --request-id {next_request_id} --reason "dispatch Companion task" --expected-orchestration-revision {insert_orchestration_revision} --json
```

The Session objective is metadata; `session chain insert --arg "<intent>"` supplies Companion's positional domain text. Never pass task prose through `--input`; that option accepts only sealed same-Session Artifact IDs. Consume the `run next` birth packet's `task` and structured `continuation`, and retain its exact Run locator and revisions.

Init `{run_dir}/evidence/companion-log.md`:
```markdown
# Companion Log: {intent}
> run_id: {run_id} | session: {session_id}

## Evidence
```

### 2. Explore

Locate targets and gather evidence before touching anything. Methods (pick what fits):

- `teammate({ agent: "explorer", tasks: [{ prompt: "FIND: ...\\nSCOPE: ..." }] })` — codebase search
- `maestro search "<keywords>" --type spec --type knowhow` — knowledge recall
- Agent (subagent) — multi-file analysis, cross-reference, pattern discovery
- Direct Read/Grep/Glob — known targets, quick lookups

Record findings under `## Evidence`:
```markdown
## Evidence
- {file:line — what was found}
- {spec/knowhow entries loaded, or "none"}
- {subagent conclusions if used}
```

### 3. Confirm

Before executing, verify evidence is sufficient:
- Target files/locations identified?
- Change scope clear (what to modify, what to leave alone)?
- No ambiguity requiring design decisions?

If insufficient → continue exploring or ask user. If `-y` → skip user confirmation interaction, but still perform evidence sufficiency self-check. If critical targets are unlocated, continue exploring (without asking user); only the 'ask user' branch is skipped.

### 4. Do

Execute the task. After each meaningful action, append under `## Work Log`:

```markdown
### {HH:MM} — {summary}
{outcome, files touched if any}
```

Rules: batch trivial reads; 1-5 lines per entry; focus on outcome not process.

### 5. Seal

Append outcome:
```markdown
## Outcome
**Status:** done | partial
**Summary:** {1-2 sentences}
**Files:** {modified/created, or "none"}
```

Before completion, put accepted decisions/locked constraints in `report.md`. If a reusable recipe or pitfall emerged, stage it now:

```bash
maestro knowledge stage knowhow "<title>" --content-file <path|-> --run <run_id>
# Then use the complete fenced `maestro run complete ... --advance` and, when the
# chain is terminal, `maestro session complete` from run-mode.md with the current
# locator, orchestration_revision, and identity.
```

Display: `Companion done. Run: {run_id} | Evidence: {path}`

If the completion receipt contains candidate IDs, display its `review_command`. Do not persist the same insight again through `/maestro-spec` or `/maestro-knowhow`.

If execution revealed the task requires multi-phase audit/diagnosis (e.g., root cause unknown, >3 files need coordinated changes), suggest: `/maestro-odyssey "<scope>" --mode debug|improve` for re-planning.

</flow>

<error_codes>
| Code | Severity | Condition | Recovery |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| E001 | error | `session open` failed (CLI unavailable, invalid args) | Check maestro CLI installation |
| E003 | error | Evidence log creation failed | Check run_dir permissions |
| W001 | warning | Explore tools unavailable (teammate({ agent: "explorer" })/search) | Degrade to direct Read/Grep |
</error_codes>
