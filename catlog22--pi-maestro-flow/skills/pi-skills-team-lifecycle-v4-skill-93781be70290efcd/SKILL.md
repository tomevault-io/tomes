<teammate_contract>

- `background: false` is the default. Use foreground dispatch whenever the result determines the current answer or next action.
- Use `background: true` only for independent work. If this turn must consume a background result, call `observe` exactly once with `action: "wait"` and a bounded timeout before continuing; never continue independently while the result is pending.
- Otherwise end the turn and wait for the automatic `teammate-complete` notification. Do not rely on `SendMessage`, `team_msg`, or hook callbacks as completion signals.
- Never silently ignore an unfinished dispatch.

# Team Lifecycle v4

Orchestrate multi-agent software development: specification → planning → implementation → testing → review.

```

## Role Registry

| Role | Path | Prefix | Inner Loop |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| coordinator | [roles/coordinator/role.md](roles/coordinator/role.md) | — | — |
| analyst | [roles/analyst/role.md](roles/analyst/role.md) | RESEARCH-* | false |
| writer | [roles/writer/role.md](roles/writer/role.md) | DRAFT-* | true |
| planner | [roles/planner/role.md](roles/planner/role.md) | PLAN-* | true |
| executor | [roles/executor/role.md](roles/executor/role.md) | IMPL-* | true |
| tester | [roles/tester/role.md](roles/tester/role.md) | TEST-* | false |
| reviewer | [roles/reviewer/role.md](roles/reviewer/role.md) | REVIEW-*, QUALITY-*, IMPROVE-* | false |
| supervisor | [roles/supervisor/role.md](roles/supervisor/role.md) | CHECKPOINT-* | false |

## Role Router

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- Has `--role <name>` → Read `roles/<name>/role.md`, execute Phase 2-4
- No `--role` → `@roles/coordinator/role.md`, execute entry router

## Shared Constants

- **Session prefix**: `TLV4`
- **Session path**: `{run_dir}/work/team/`
- **CLI tools**: `teammate({ agent: "general", taskType: "analysis" })` (read-only), `teammate({ agent: "general", taskType: "development" })` (modifications)
- **Message bus**: `mcp__maestro__team_msg(session_id=<run-id>, ...)`

## Worker Spawn Template

Coordinator spawns workers using this template:

```
teammate({ agent: "team-worker", tasks: [{ taskType: "<task_type>", name: "<role>", prompt: `## Role Assignment
role: <role>
role_spec: <skill_root>/roles/<role>/role.md
session: {run_dir}/work/team
session_id: <run-id>
team_name: <team-name>
requirement: <task-description>
inner_loop: <true|false>
run_dir: <run-dir from team-session.json run.run_dir>

## Progress Milestones
session_id: <run-id>
Report progress via team_msg at natural phase boundaries (context loaded -> core work done -> verification).
Report blockers immediately via team_msg type="blocker".
Report completion via team_msg type="task_complete" after final SendMessage.

Read role_spec file (@<skill_root>/roles/<role>/role.md) to load Phase 2-4 domain instructions.
Execute built-in Phase 1 (task discovery) -> role Phase 2-4 -> built-in Phase 5 (report).`, description: "Spawn <role> worker" }], background: true })
```

## Supervisor Spawn Template

Supervisor is a **resident agent** (independent from team-worker). Spawned once during session init, woken via SendMessage for each CHECKPOINT task.

### Spawn (Phase 2 — once per session)

```
teammate({ agent: "team-supervisor", tasks: [{ taskType: "<task_type>", name: "supervisor", prompt: `## Role Assignment
role: supervisor
role_spec: <skill_root>/roles/supervisor/role.md
session: {run_dir}/work/team
session_id: <run-id>
team_name: <team-name>
requirement: <task-description>
run_dir: <run-dir from team-session.json run.run_dir>

## Progress Milestones
session_id: <run-id>
Report progress via team_msg at natural phase boundaries (context loaded -> core work done -> verification).
Report blockers immediately via team_msg type="blocker".
Report completion via team_msg type="task_complete" after final SendMessage.

Read role_spec file (@<skill_root>/roles/supervisor/role.md) to load checkpoint definitions.
Init: load baseline context, report ready, go idle.
Wake cycle: coordinator sends checkpoint requests via SendMessage.`, description: "Spawn resident supervisor" }], background: true })
```

### Wake (handleSpawnNext — per CHECKPOINT task)

```
SendMessage({
  type: "message",
  recipient: "supervisor",
  content: `## Checkpoint Request
task_id: <CHECKPOINT-NNN>
scope: [<upstream-task-ids>]
pipeline_progress: <done>/<total> tasks completed`,
  summary: "Checkpoint request: <CHECKPOINT-NNN>"
})
```

### Shutdown (handleComplete)

```
SendMessage({
  type: "shutdown_request",
  recipient: "supervisor",
  content: "Pipeline complete, shutting down supervisor"
})
```

## User Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `check` / `status` | View execution status graph |
| `resume` / `continue` | Advance to next step |
| `revise <TASK-ID> [feedback]` | Revise specific task |
| `feedback <text>` | Inject feedback for revision |
| `recheck` | Re-run quality check |
| `improve [dimension]` | Auto-improve weakest dimension |

## Completion Action

When pipeline completes, coordinator presents:

```
ask user ({
  questions: [{
    question: "Pipeline complete. What would you like to do?",
    header: "Completion",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Archive & Clean (Recommended)", description: "Archive session, clean up team" },
      { label: "Keep Active", description: "Keep session for follow-up work" },
      { label: "Export Results", description: "Export deliverables to target directory" }
    ]
  }]
})
```

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| Unknown command | Error with available command list |
| Role not found | Error with role registry |
| CLI tool fails | Worker fallback to direct implementation |
| Fast-advance conflict | Coordinator reconciles on next callback |
| Supervisor crash | Respawn with `recovery: true`, auto-rebuilds from existing reports |
| Supervisor not ready for CHECKPOINT | Spawn/respawn supervisor, wait for ready, then wake |
| Completion action fails | Default to Keep Active |
