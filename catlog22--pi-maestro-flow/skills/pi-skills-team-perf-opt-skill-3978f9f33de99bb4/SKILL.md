- `background: false` is the default. Use foreground dispatch whenever the result determines the current answer or next action.
- Use `background: true` only for independent work. If this turn must consume a background result, call `observe` exactly once with `action: "wait"` and a bounded timeout before continuing; never continue independently while the result is pending.
- Otherwise end the turn and wait for the automatic `teammate-complete` notification. Do not rely on `SendMessage`, `team_msg`, or hook callbacks as completion signals.
- Never silently ignore an unfinished dispatch.

# Team Performance Optimization

Profile application performance, identify bottlenecks, design optimization strategies, implement changes, benchmark improvements, and review code quality.

Pipeline (Single mode):
  PROFILE-001 -> STRATEGY-001 -> IMPL-001 -> BENCH-001 + REVIEW-001 (fix cycle)

Pipeline (Fan-out mode):
  PROFILE-001 -> STRATEGY-001 -> [IMPL-B01..N](parallel) -> BENCH+REVIEW per branch

Pipeline (Independent mode):
  [Pipeline A: PROFILE-A->STRATEGY-A->IMPL-A->BENCH-A+REVIEW-A]
  [Pipeline B: PROFILE-B->STRATEGY-B->IMPL-B->BENCH-B+REVIEW-B] (parallel)
```

## Role Registry

| Role | Path | Prefix | Inner Loop |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| coordinator | [roles/coordinator/role.md](roles/coordinator/role.md) | — | — |
| profiler | [roles/profiler/role.md](roles/profiler/role.md) | PROFILE-* | false |
| strategist | [roles/strategist/role.md](roles/strategist/role.md) | STRATEGY-* | false |
| optimizer | [roles/optimizer/role.md](roles/optimizer/role.md) | IMPL-*, FIX-* | true |
| benchmarker | [roles/benchmarker/role.md](roles/benchmarker/role.md) | BENCH-* | false |
| reviewer | [roles/reviewer/role.md](roles/reviewer/role.md) | REVIEW-*, QUALITY-* | false |


## Pre-load (coordinator, before dispatch)

1. **Codebase docs**: If `.workflow/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md` exists, read for module boundaries
2. **Specs (coding)**: `maestro load --type spec --category coding` — load coding constraints as shared context
3. **Wiki knowledge**: `maestro search "performance optimization profiling" --json` — top 5 entries as prior context
4. All optional — proceed without if unavailable
## Role Router

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- Has `--role <name>` → Read `roles/<name>/role.md`, execute Phase 2-4
- No `--role` → `@roles/coordinator/role.md`, execute entry router

## Shared Constants

- **Session prefix**: `PERF-OPT`
- **Session path**: `{run_dir}/work/team/`
- **Team name**: `perf-opt`
- **CLI tools**: `teammate({ agent: "general", taskType: "analysis" })` (read-only), `teammate({ agent: "general", taskType: "development" })` (modifications)
- **Message bus**: `mcp__maestro__team_msg(session_id=<run-id>, ...)`

## Worker Spawn Template

Coordinator spawns workers using this template:

```
teammate({ agent: "team-worker", tasks: [{ taskType: "<task_type>", name: "<role>", prompt: `## Role Assignment
role: <role>
role_spec: <skill_root>/roles/<role>/role.md
session: {run_dir}/work/team
session_id: <run-id>
team_name: perf-opt
requirement: <task-description>
inner_loop: <true|false>

## Progress Milestones
session_id: <run-id>
Report progress via team_msg at natural phase boundaries (context loaded -> core work done -> verification).
Report blockers immediately via team_msg type="blocker".
Report completion via team_msg type="task_complete" after final SendMessage.

Read role_spec file (@<skill_root>/roles/<role>/role.md) to load Phase 2-4 domain instructions.
Execute built-in Phase 1 (task discovery) -> role Phase 2-4 -> built-in Phase 5 (report).`, description: "Spawn <role> worker" }], background: true })
```

**Inner Loop roles** (optimizer): Set `inner_loop` dynamically — `true` for single mode, `false` for fan-out/independent (parallel branches).
**Single-task roles** (profiler, strategist, benchmarker, reviewer): Set `inner_loop: false`.

## User Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `check` / `status` | Output execution status graph (branch-grouped), no advancement |
| `resume` / `continue` | Check worker states, advance next step |
| `revise <TASK-ID> [feedback]` | Create revision task + cascade downstream (scoped to branch) |
| `feedback <text>` | Analyze feedback impact, create targeted revision chain |
| `recheck` | Re-run quality check |
| `improve [dimension]` | Auto-improve weakest dimension |

## Session Directory

```
{run_dir}/work/team/
+-- team-session.json                    # Session metadata + status + parallel_mode
+-- {run_dir}/outputs/              # Run deliverables (via maestro run)
|   +-- baseline-metrics.json       # Profiler: before-optimization metrics
|   +-- bottleneck-report.md        # Profiler: ranked bottleneck findings
|   +-- optimization-plan.md        # Strategist: prioritized optimization plan
|   +-- benchmark-results.json      # Benchmarker: after-optimization metrics
|   +-- review-report.md            # Reviewer: code review findings
|   +-- branches/B01/...            # Fan-out branch artifacts
|   +-- pipelines/A/...             # Independent pipeline artifacts
+-- explorations/                   # Shared explore cache
+-- wisdom/patterns.md              # Discovered patterns and conventions
+-- {run_dir}/evidence/discussions/                    # Discussion records
+-- .msg/messages.jsonl             # Team message bus
+-- .msg/meta.json                  # Session metadata
```

## Completion Action

When the pipeline completes:

```
ask user ({
  questions: [{
    question: "Team pipeline complete. What would you like to do?",
    header: "Completion",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Archive & Clean (Recommended)", description: "Archive session, clean up tasks and team resources" },
      { label: "Keep Active", description: "Keep session active for follow-up work or inspection" },
      { label: "Export Results", description: "Export deliverables to a specified location, then clean" }
    ]
  }]
})
```

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| Unknown --role value | Error with role registry list |
| Role file not found | Error with expected path (roles/{name}/role.md) |
| Profiling tool not available | Fallback to static analysis methods |
| Benchmark regression detected | Auto-create FIX task with regression details |
| Review-fix cycle exceeds 3 iterations | Escalate to user |
| One branch IMPL fails | Mark that branch failed, other branches continue |
| Fast-advance conflict | Coordinator reconciles on next callback |
| Completion action fails | Default to Keep Active |
