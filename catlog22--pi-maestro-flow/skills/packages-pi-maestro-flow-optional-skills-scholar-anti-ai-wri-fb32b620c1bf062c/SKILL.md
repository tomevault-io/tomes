# Scholar Anti-AI Writing

Detect and eliminate AI writing patterns from academic prose. Based on Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" guide. Supports both English and Chinese text.

**Core insight**: LLMs predict the most statistically likely outcome — creating detectable patterns. This skill identifies and rewrites those patterns while preserving meaning and adding authentic voice.

## Pre-load (before execution)

1. **Codebase docs**: If `.workflow/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md` exists, read for project context
2. **Specs**: `maestro load --type spec --category coding` — load coding conventions
3. **Wiki knowledge**: `maestro search "academic writing research paper" --json` — top 5 entries as prior context
4. All optional — proceed without if unavailable

## Architecture Overview

## Key Design Principles

1. **Pattern detection + soul injection**: Removing AI patterns is only half the job — add authentic voice.
2. **Preserve meaning**: Core content and technical claims must remain intact.
3. **Language-aware**: English and Chinese have different AI pattern signatures.
4. **Scoring-driven**: Quantitative 5-dimension scoring (50-point scale) guides revision.
5. **Academic tone**: Maintain scholarly register — humanize without becoming informal.

## Interactive Preference Collection

Before dispatching to any phase, collect these preferences:

```
Questions to ask the user:

1. Input Source
   "What text should I process? (file path, directory, or paste text)"
   → inputSource

2. Language
   Options: English | Chinese | Bilingual (auto-detect per section)
   → language

3. Writing Context
   Options: Academic Paper | Technical Report | Blog/Article | General Prose
   → writingContext

4. Aggressiveness
   Options: Conservative (minimal changes) | Balanced (Recommended) | Aggressive (heavy rewrite)
   → aggressiveness
```

Store responses as `antiAiPreferences` context for all phases.

## Auto Mode Defaults

When `workflowPreferences.autoYes === true`:
- Process all .tex files in cwd
- Auto-detect language
- Academic Paper context, Balanced aggressiveness
- Skip confirmation prompts

## Execution Flow

> **COMPACT DIRECTIVE**: Context compression MUST check TodoWrite phase status.
> The phase currently marked `in_progress` is the active execution phase — preserve its FULL content.
> Only compress phases marked `completed` or `pending`.

### TodoWrite Setup

```
Anti-AI Writing:
- [ ] Phase 1: Detect & Score — scan for AI patterns, generate initial score
- [ ] Phase 2: Rewrite & Polish — rewrite flagged sections, add voice
- [ ] Phase 3: Validate & Score — re-score, verify quality threshold
```

### Phase Sequence

```
Phase 1: Detect & Score
   └─ Ref: phases/01-detect-score.md
      ├─ Input: inputSource, language
      └─ Output: patternReport (flagged passages + initial scores)

Phase 2: Rewrite & Polish
   └─ Ref: phases/02-rewrite-polish.md
      ├─ Input: patternReport, writingContext, aggressiveness
      └─ Output: polishedText (rewritten content)

Phase 3: Validate & Score
   └─ Ref: phases/03-validate-score.md
      ├─ Input: polishedText, original text
      └─ Output: finalReport (before/after scores, diff)
```

**Phase Reference Documents** (read on-demand when phase executes):

| Phase | Document | Purpose | Compact |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| 1 | [phases/01-detect-score.md](phases/01-detect-score.md) | Scan patterns, score text | TodoWrite driven |
| 2 | [phases/02-rewrite-polish.md](phases/02-rewrite-polish.md) | Rewrite and humanize | TodoWrite driven + sentinel |
| 3 | [phases/03-validate-score.md](phases/03-validate-score.md) | Re-score, generate report | TodoWrite driven |

**Compact Rules**:
1. **TodoWrite `in_progress`** → preserve full content, do not compress
2. **TodoWrite `completed`** → may compress to summary
3. **sentinel fallback** → phases marked with sentinel contain compact sentinel; if only sentinel remains, **must immediately `Read()` to recover**

## Core Rules

1. **Never lose meaning**: Technical claims, data, and specific facts must survive rewriting.
2. **Score before and after**: Every processed text gets a 5-dimension score (50-point scale).
3. **Flag, don't force**: In Conservative mode, highlight issues but let the user decide.
4. **Academic register**: For papers, maintain formal-but-natural tone. No slang or casual language.
5. **Minimum threshold**: Target score >= 35/50 for academic papers, >= 40/50 for submission-ready.

## Quick Scoring System (5 dimensions, 10 points each)

| Dimension | Question | Target |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Directness** | Direct statements or announcements? | >= 7 |
| **Rhythm** | Varied or metronomic? | >= 7 |
| **Trust** | Respects reader intelligence? | >= 7 |
| **Authenticity** | Sounds human? | >= 7 |
| **Density** | Anything cuttable? | >= 7 |

## Data Flow

```
Phase 1 ──patternReport──→ Phase 2
Phase 2 ──polishedText──→ Phase 3
Phase 1 ──originalText──→ Phase 3 (for comparison)
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| File not found | Ask user for correct path |
| Mixed languages in one file | Process each section in detected language |
| Score below threshold after rewrite | Flag for manual review, suggest specific areas |
| LaTeX commands broken during rewrite | Preserve LaTeX structure, only modify prose content |
| User disagrees with changes | Offer side-by-side diff, allow per-section accept/reject |
