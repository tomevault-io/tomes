name: team-issue
description: Unified team skill for issue resolution. Uses team-worker agent architecture with role directories for domain logic. Coordinator orchestrates pipeline, workers are team-worker agents. Triggers on \"team issue\". Use when this capability is needed.

- `background: false` is the default. Use foreground dispatch whenever the result determines the current answer or next action.
- Use `background: true` only for independent work. If this turn must consume a background result, call `observe` exactly once with `action: "wait"` and a bounded timeout before continuing; never continue independently while the result is pending.
- Otherwise end the turn and wait for the automatic `teammate-complete` notification. Do not rely on `SendMessage`, `team_msg`, or hook callbacks as completion signals.
- Never silently ignore an unfinished dispatch.

# Team Issue Resolution

Orchestrate issue resolution pipeline: explore context -> plan solution -> review (optional) -> marshal queue -> implement. Supports Quick, Full, and Batch pipelines with review-fix cycle.

## Role Registry

| Role | Path | Prefix | Inner Loop |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| coordinator | [roles/coordinator/role.md](roles/coordinator/role.md) | — | — |
| explorer | [roles/explorer/role.md](roles/explorer/role.md) | EXPLORE-* | false |
| planner | [roles/planner/role.md](roles/planner/role.md) | SOLVE-* | false |
| reviewer | [roles/reviewer/role.md](roles/reviewer/role.md) | AUDIT-* | false |
| integrator | [roles/integrator/role.md](roles/integrator/role.md) | MARSHAL-* | false |
| implementer | [roles/implementer/role.md](roles/implementer/role.md) | BUILD-* | false |


## Pre-load (coordinator, before dispatch)

1. **Codebase docs**: If `.workflow/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md` exists, read for module boundaries
2. **Specs (coding)**: `maestro load --type spec --category coding` — load coding constraints as shared context
3. **Specs (debug)**: `maestro load --type spec --category debug` — load debug constraints as shared context
4. **Wiki knowledge**: `maestro search "issue resolution fix" --json` — top 5 entries as prior context
5. All optional — proceed without if unavailable
## Role Router

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- Has `--role <name>` → Read `roles/<name>/role.md`, execute Phase 2-4
- No `--role` → `@roles/coordinator/role.md`, execute entry router

## Shared Constants

- **Session prefix**: `TISL`
- **Session path**: `{run_dir}/work/team/`
- **Team name**: `issue`
- **CLI tools**: `teammate({ agent: "general", taskType: "analysis" })` (read-only), `teammate({ agent: "general", taskType: "development" })` (modifications)
- **Message bus**: `mcp__maestro__team_msg(session_id=<run-id>, ...)`

## Worker Spawn Template

Coordinator spawns workers using this template:

```
teammate({ agent: "team-worker", tasks: [{ taskType: "<task_type>", name: "<role>", prompt: `## Role Assignment
role: <role>
role_spec: <skill_root>/roles/<role>/role.md
session: {run_dir}/work/team
session_id: <run-id>
team_name: issue
requirement: <task-description>
inner_loop: false

## Progress Milestones
session_id: <run-id>
Report progress via team_msg at natural phase boundaries (context loaded -> core work done -> verification).
Report blockers immediately via team_msg type="blocker".
Report completion via team_msg type="task_complete" after final SendMessage.

Read role_spec file (@<skill_root>/roles/<role>/role.md) to load Phase 2-4 domain instructions.
Execute built-in Phase 1 (task discovery) -> role Phase 2-4 -> built-in Phase 5 (report).`, description: "Spawn <role> worker" }], background: true })
```

**Parallel spawn** (Batch mode, N explorer or M implementer instances):

```
teammate({ agent: "team-worker", tasks: [{ taskType: "<task_type>", name: "<role>-<N>", prompt: `## Role Assignment
role: <role>
role_spec: <skill_root>/roles/<role>/role.md
session: {run_dir}/work/team
session_id: <run-id>
team_name: issue
requirement: <task-description>
agent_name: <role>-<N>
inner_loop: false

## Progress Milestones
session_id: <run-id>
Report progress via team_msg at natural phase boundaries (context loaded -> core work done -> verification).
Report blockers immediately via team_msg type="blocker".
Report completion via team_msg type="task_complete" after final SendMessage.

Read role_spec file (@<skill_root>/roles/<role>/role.md) to load Phase 2-4 domain instructions.
Execute built-in Phase 1 (task discovery, owner=<role>-<N>) -> role Phase 2-4 -> built-in Phase 5 (report).` }], background: true })
```

## User Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `check` / `status` | View execution status graph, no advancement |
| `resume` / `continue` | Check worker states, advance next step |

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| Unknown command | Error with available command list |
| Role not found | Error with role registry |
| CLI tool fails | Worker fallback to direct implementation |
| Fast-advance conflict | Coordinator reconciles on next callback |
| Completion action fails | Default to Keep Active |
| Review rejection exceeds 2 rounds | Force convergence to integrator |
| No issues found for given IDs | Coordinator reports error to user |
| Deferred BUILD count unknown | Defer to MARSHAL callback |
