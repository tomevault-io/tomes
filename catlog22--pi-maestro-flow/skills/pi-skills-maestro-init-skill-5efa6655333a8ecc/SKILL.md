<teammate_contract>

- `background: false` is the default. Use foreground dispatch whenever the result determines the current answer or next action.
- Use `background: true` only for independent work. If this turn must consume a background result, call `observe` exactly once with `action: "wait"` and a bounded timeout before continuing; never continue independently while the result is pending.
- Otherwise end the turn and wait for the automatic `teammate-complete` notification. Do not rely on `SendMessage`, `team_msg`, or hook callbacks as completion signals.
- Never silently ignore an unfinished dispatch.

</teammate_contract>

<purpose>
Initialize project: detect state, create `.workflow/` with project.md, state.json, config.json.
Entry point; downstream: step `roadmap` or step `brainstorm`.
</purpose>

<deferred_reading>
- [project.md](~/.maestro/templates/project.md) — read when generating project description
- [state.json](~/.maestro/templates/state.json) — read when creating initial state
- [config.json](~/.maestro/templates/config.json) — read when creating workflow configuration
</deferred_reading>

<context>
$ARGUMENTS — none for interactive mode, or `-y` with `@file` reference for auto mode.

**Flags:**

| Flag | Effect | Default |
|------|--------|---------|
| `-y` / `--yes` | Automatic mode. After config questions, runs research without further interaction. Expects idea document via @ reference. | `false` |
| `--from <source>` | Load upstream context package (brainstorm:ID, @file, or path). Consumes context-package.json to pre-fill project vision, goals, constraints, and terminology. Skips interactive questioning. Alias: `--from-brainstorm` | — |

**Load project state if exists:**
Check for `.workflow/state.json` -- loads context if project already initialized.

**Output boundary**: ALL file writes MUST target `.workflow/` (project.md, state.json, config.json, specs/) only. NEVER modify source code or files outside `.workflow/`.
</context>

<invariants>
1. **Idempotent init** — re-running init on an already-initialized project MUST detect existing `.workflow/` and warn (E002); NEVER silently overwrite existing state
2. **Scope guard** — init MUST only make initialization decisions; NEVER prejudge roadmap structure, plan scope, or implementation details
3. **All artifacts required** — init MUST NOT report completion until project.md, state.json, and config.json all exist; missing artifacts MUST be created before exit
4. **Template-driven** — deferred templates (project.md, state.json, config.json) MUST be read from `~/.maestro/templates/` and customized; NEVER generate from scratch without template
5. **Interview writes back** — all interactive decisions MUST be written to project.md/config.json before proceeding to research or completion; NEVER leave decisions unrecorded
</invariants>

<interview_protocol>
Follows ~/.maestro/workflows/interview-mechanics.md standard.

**Interaction mode**: convergent menu-driven
**Decision tree** (strict order): project type (greenfield / existing codebase onboarding) → tech stack detection and confirmation → directory structure preferences → initial configuration (specs categories, wiki bootstrap)
**Scope guard**: only init decisions; do not prejudge roadmap structure or plan scope
**Writeback target**: project.md (project description) + config.json (settings) + state.json (initial state)
**Additional skip conditions**: --from source (upstream context pre-fills decisions)
**Exit condition**: all configuration questions settled → proceed to workflow execution
</interview_protocol>

<execution>

### Phase Gates (MANDATORY, BLOCKING)

**GATE 1: Pre-flight → Interview**
- REQUIRED: `.workflow/` existence check completed.
- REQUIRED: `--from` source validated (if provided).
- BLOCKED if: E002 (greenfield conflict with existing `.workflow/`) unresolved.

**GATE 2: Interview → Research**
- REQUIRED: All interview decisions recorded in project.md and config.json.
- REQUIRED: `.workflow/` directory created with initial structure.
- BLOCKED if: interview decisions not yet written to files.

**GATE 3: Research → Completion**
- REQUIRED: All 3 required artifacts exist (project.md, state.json, config.json).
- REQUIRED: `.workflow/specs/` initialized.
- BLOCKED if: any artifact missing — write it before reporting completion.

### Pre-flight

1. Check if `.workflow/` already exists — if so, load state and warn (E002 for greenfield conflicts)
2. Validate `--from` source is accessible if provided

Follow '~/.maestro/workflows/init.md' completely.

### Artifact Verification (before completion)

```
REQUIRED_ARTIFACTS = [
  ".workflow/project.md",    // Core Value, Requirements, Key Decisions
  ".workflow/state.json",    // artifacts[], initialized to idle state
  ".workflow/config.json"    // Workflow configuration
]
```
If any artifact is missing: DO NOT report completion. Write the missing file first.
</execution>

<completion>
### Standalone report

```
=== WORKFLOW INITIALIZED ===
Project: {project_name}
State:   .workflow/state.json (active)

Created:
  .workflow/project.md
  .workflow/state.json
  .workflow/config.json
  .workflow/specs/
```

### Ralph-invoked completion

End the step through the v3 Run lifecycle (no text block output):
```
maestro run complete {run_id} --session {session_id} --participant {actor_id} --actor {actor_id} --request-id {complete_request_id} --reason "complete init Run" --expected-orchestration-revision {orchestration_revision} --expected-run-revision {run_revision} --verdict {VERDICT} [--summary "<summary>"] --advance --json
```
(run-id 由 birth packet 提供 — 自动解析当前 running 步)

Verdicts (v3 surface):
- **done** — Normal completion
- **done_with_concerns** — Completed with concerns; pass `--summary` and put concerns in `report.md` frontmatter
- **needs-retry / blocked** — apply the exact structured `continuation` using fully fenced `run transition` or `run cancel`; retry only through a later fenced `run next` after Runtime reports the step pending

### Next-step routing

| Condition | Suggestion |
|-----------|-----------|
| Roadmap needed (default light) | route step `roadmap` through `/maestro-next` or the canonical receipt-chained `session open` -> `session chain insert --command roadmap --arg "<goal>"` -> `run next` flow |

Note: roadmap step is responsible for creating `state.json.sessions[]` entries and setting the first `active_session_id`.
| Full spec package | route step `blueprint` through `/maestro-next` or the canonical receipt-chained self-start flow |
| Explore ideas first | route step `brainstorm` through `/maestro-next` or the canonical receipt-chained self-start flow |
| Quick ad-hoc task | `/maestro-companion "{goal}"` |
</completion>

<error_codes>
| Code | Severity | Condition | Recovery |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| E001 | error | No arguments provided when -y requires @ reference | Check arguments format, re-run with correct input |
| E002 | error | .workflow/ already exists (greenfield init) | Use --from to import existing state, or remove .workflow/ to start fresh |
| E003 | error | Context source not found (--from / --from-brainstorm) | Check arguments format, re-run with correct input |
| E004 | error | Template file missing in ~/.maestro/templates/ | Run maestro-update to restore templates |
| E005 | warning | .workflow/ already exists (existing codebase onboarding) | Merge with existing state or overwrite; user chooses via user prompt |
| W001 | warning | Research agent failed, continuing with partial results | Retry research or proceed with partial results |
</error_codes>
