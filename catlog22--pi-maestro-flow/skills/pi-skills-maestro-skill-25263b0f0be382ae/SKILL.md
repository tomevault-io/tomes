<teammate_contract>

- `background: false` is the default. Use foreground dispatch whenever the result determines the current answer or next action.
- Use `background: true` only for independent work. If this turn must consume a background result, call `observe` exactly once with `action: "wait"` and a bounded timeout before continuing; never continue independently while the result is pending.
- Otherwise end the turn and wait for the automatic `teammate-complete` notification. Do not rely on `SendMessage`, `team_msg`, or hook callbacks as completion signals.
- Never silently ignore an unfinished dispatch.

<host_mirror>

Pi mirrors canonical Session/Run state automatically:

- Advance only with `todo({ action: "next" })`; do not create or update mirror tasks manually.
- Goal completion is derived from terminal chain state and clean gates.
- After compaction, reattach through the current Run's `brief.command`.

</host_mirror>

<pi_run_control>

Pi lifecycle routing:

- Execute every Session/Run lifecycle read or mutation with the `run-control` tool by passing the displayed Maestro arguments as `argv` without the leading `maestro` executable. Never execute lifecycle mutation through Bash.
- Fenced Maestro CLI examples below are human syntax references, not an alternate Pi execution path. Shorthand command-family mentions are not executable examples. Any executable human CLI example must show the complete v3 authority envelope: exact `--session`, identical `--participant` and `--actor`, a distinct `--request-id`, `--reason`, and the applicable entity revision fences.
- For `session open`, the coordinator injects participant == actor, request ID, reason, and JSON output; a new Session has no `--session` or expected revision yet.
- For operations on an active Session, the coordinator injects the exact `--session`, participant == actor, request ID, reason, and current `--expected-orchestration-revision`; Run mutations also receive `--expected-run-revision`. `session migrate` uses legacy identity/activity revision fences instead.
- The coordinator must be available for every `run-control` call. Session opening does not require an already active Session; all other mutations target an exact active or explicitly named Session.

If any required file above was not expanded into context by the host, or its content is no longer in context, Read it explicitly before executing the state machine.

<deferred_reading>
- [maestro.md](~/.maestro/workflows/maestro.md) — read before initial intent classification
- [ralph-amend-goal.md](~/.maestro/workflows/ralph-amend-goal.md) — read only for `--amend`
</deferred_reading>

<purpose>
Turn a user intent into the initial Skill chain, create one canonical topic Session through `maestro session open --chain <commands...>` (no chain-file), then execute the shared Run loop. Static versus dynamic is not a Session or command mode: each Skill contract decides whether it emits a typed chain proposal. For new intents, use this command. For policy-driven execution over existing Sessions, use `/maestro-ralph`.
</purpose>

<pi_context_contract>

- Consume the injected Topic Session resolution and ReuseAssessment as read-only routing evidence.
- Accept upstream only from same-Session sealed outputs.
- Resolve each `argument_requirements` entry through `required`, `missing`, `type`, `source`, optional `default`, and `question`.
- Treat the birth packet as compact routing; load the execution protocol from `brief.command`.
- A completion hint with `suggest_only=true` is displayed and never executed implicitly.

</pi_context_contract>

<interface>
Only these user flags are accepted:

- `-y` — skip all confirmation/clarification interactions, use default choices. Does NOT change data semantics (no auto-deferred decisions). Never bypasses: high-risk classification, confidence <60, ambiguity requiring user input, failed gates, or drift escalation.
- `-c` — continue the unique live compatible Session.
- `--amend` — amend that Session's goal; remaining text is the change request.
- `--dry-run` — classify and display the proposed chain without creating a Session or executing any step.

Execution always dispatches run-executor (the default behavior); this never changes Session type or chain semantics.

All other text is intent. Unknown flags are not silently reinterpreted. Platform, roadmap, quality, template reuse, parallelism and adversarial depth are inferred.
</interface>

<invariants>
1. **One chain** — every task uses the same Session/Run protocol; no static/dynamic, Maestro/Ralph, or executor-specific Session type.
2. **Session before execution** — open via `maestro session open "<objective>" --id <slug> --chain <commands...>` before allocating a step Run.
3. **Creator owns decomposition** — Maestro creates `boundary_contract` and outcome-oriented goals; later orchestrators consume rather than overwrite them.
4. **Runtime owns mutation** — prompt never writes session.json/run.json and never auto-uses admin chain commands.
5. **Skill owns domain adaptation** — optional chain changes come only from the current Skill's validated `chain-proposal/1.0`.
6. **Verdict advances** — execution steps advance only through fenced `maestro run complete ... --advance --verdict done|done_with_concerns`; decision steps only through fenced `maestro run decide`.
7. **Historical similarity remains read-only evidence** — it never selects a Session or binds outputs.
8. **Compatibility commands are out of band** — normal orchestration calls only `maestro run ...`.
9. **Auto is bounded** — `-y` never bypasses high risk, low confidence, ambiguity, failed gates or drift escalation.
10. **Router is not a step** — `/maestro-next` may route here but never appears inside the chain.
11. **Running means continue** — while canonical continuation authority is `automatic`, execute it and re-read the receipt in the same turn; `suggest_only` is Runtime passivity, not a reason to end the turn.
</invariants>

</transitions>

<actions>

### A_CLASSIFY

Read deferred `maestro.md`. Record matched evidence, excluded alternatives and confidence before creation.

Minimum chain rules:

| Intent evidence | Initial chain |
|---|---|
| narrow fix/change | analyze → plan → execute → review/test as required |
| broad rewrite/migration | analyze-macro → scope decision → plan/roadmap path |
| brainstorm/explore | brainstorm, then only Skill-proposed continuation |
| stress/grill | grill, then only Skill-proposed continuation |
| formal specification | blueprint → plan path |
| existing compatible Session | do not rebuild; enter shared loop |

Roadmap is inferred only for multi-release evidence. Quality depth follows project specs, UI evidence needs frontend verification, and every executable command is resolved by Run Runtime.

### A_DECOMPOSE

For broad intent, ask at most 3 questions covering scope, constraints and observable done criteria; broad ambiguity is not skipped by `-y`. (broad = affects ≥3 modules OR requires cross-package interface changes OR ≥2 of 3 decomposition questions remain unanswered.) Produce:

```json
{
  "boundary_contract": { "in_scope": [], "out_of_scope": [], "constraints": [], "definition_of_done": "" },
  "decomposition": {
    "execution_criteria": [],
    "goals": [{ "id": "G1", "goal": "", "boundary": "", "done_when": "", "evidence": "", "lifecycle": [], "status": "pending" }],
    "changelog": []
  }
}
```

Goals describe outcomes, not lifecycle stages.

### A_CREATE

Assemble and create per `prepare/maestro.md` §1–§4 (specs precheck, Skill-name prevalidation, chain assembly, creation). Maestro-specific policy:

- The chain assembly protocol (§3 template) lives in `prepare/maestro.md` (required_reading); if it is not in context, Read that file directly. In v3 the same prepare guidance is injected into the `run next` / `run create` birth packet (`guidance-snapshot/1.0`) — prepare is embedded in the Run, not a standalone `run prepare` step.
- Maestro does not emit formal decision nodes; new chains express quality/goal/scope checks as Skill steps that own a Run and may return a proposal. (The closed-loop policy that mandates decision nodes before seal belongs to `/maestro-ralph`; route there when the work needs it.)
- For narrow/single-step chains, generate a minimal implicit boundary_contract: in_scope = [intent], out_of_scope = [], constraints = [], definition_of_done = 'step completed with passing gates'.
- Do not inline unescaped JSON.

### A_CONTINUE

Use read-only `maestro run recall` plus `maestro session status --session {session_id} --json`. A Session with an open decision gate or a stuck Run is out of scope here — report it and route to `/maestro-ralph -c` for audited recovery (S_FALLBACK); completed/archived Sessions are terminal. Multiple live candidates require explicit selection.

### A_AMEND

Read `ralph-amend-goal.md`, use `maestro session status --session {session_id} --json` for the snapshot, perform read-only impact analysis, confirm, then apply the amendment through a chain-aware typed proposal: goal/decomposition metadata is committed with fenced `maestro session chain insert|replace` (per-step `--goal-ref` / `--stage` / `--decision-ref`). `session meta update` is session/1.x/2.0 compatibility-only and must not be used in the canonical branch. Any pending-tail change must come from a planning Skill proposal.

### A_DRY_RUN

Perform A_CLASSIFY and A_DECOMPOSE in memory, display the proposed chain, boundary contract, goals, risk and unresolved arguments, then END. Do not call any Session/Run mutation command, dispatch an executor, or write workflow authority.
</actions>

</state_machine>

<success_criteria>
- Public flags are `-y`, `-c`, `--amend`, `--dry-run`.
- `--dry-run` emits a chain preview and performs no Session/Run mutation or executor dispatch.
- Initial classification is auditable and the Session exists before step execution.
- Every step follows `run next` → brief → execute → `run check` → `run complete --advance`; decision nodes use `run decide`.
- Chain adaptation is Skill-proposed and atomically applied by the producing Run (`session chain insert|replace|skip`).
- Normal output and recommendations contain only `maestro run ...` lifecycle commands.
</success_criteria>

## Legacy `session/1.x/2.x` Compatibility Branch

The v2 command surface is **deprecated / compatibility-only** for explicitly selected old CLI/schema (see run-mode.md Legacy `session/1.x/2.x` Compatibility Branch): `maestro session create --chain-file`, `maestro session done --verdict`, `maestro session decide`, `maestro session meta update`, and the standalone `run prepare` dispatcher are never used by the canonical flow above. Normal orchestration calls only the v3 surface: `session open/status/list/chain insert|replace|skip/complete`, `run next/create/brief/check/complete --advance/decide/transition/cancel`, and `knowledge stage/review/promote`.
