<teammate_contract>

- `background: false` is the default. Use foreground dispatch whenever the result determines the current answer or next action.
- Use `background: true` only for independent work. If this turn must consume a background result, call `observe` exactly once with `action: "wait"` and a bounded timeout before continuing; never continue independently while the result is pending.
- Otherwise end the turn and wait for the automatic `teammate-complete` notification. Do not rely on `SendMessage`, `team_msg`, or hook callbacks as completion signals.
- Never silently ignore an unfinished dispatch.

<host_mirror>

Pi mirrors canonical Session/Run state automatically:

- Advance only with `todo({ action: "next" })`; do not create or update mirror tasks manually.
- Goal completion is derived from terminal chain state and clean gates.
- After compaction, reattach through the current Run's `brief.command`.

</host_mirror>

<pi_run_control>

Pi lifecycle routing:

- Execute every Session/Run lifecycle read or mutation with the `run-control` tool by passing the displayed Maestro arguments as `argv` without the leading `maestro` executable. Never execute lifecycle mutation through Bash.
- Fenced Maestro CLI examples below are human syntax references, not an alternate Pi execution path. Shorthand command-family mentions are not executable examples. Any executable human CLI example must show the complete v3 authority envelope: exact `--session`, identical `--participant` and `--actor`, a distinct `--request-id`, `--reason`, and the applicable entity revision fences.
- For `session open`, the coordinator injects participant == actor, request ID, reason, and JSON output; a new Session has no `--session` or expected revision yet.
- For operations on an active Session, the coordinator injects the exact `--session`, participant == actor, request ID, reason, and current `--expected-orchestration-revision`; Run mutations also receive `--expected-run-revision`. `session migrate` uses legacy identity/activity revision fences instead.
- The coordinator must be available for every `run-control` call. Session opening does not require an already active Session; all other mutations target an exact active or explicitly named Session.

If any required file above was not expanded into context by the host, or its content is no longer in context, Read it explicitly before executing the state machine.

- [ralph-amend-goal.md](~/.maestro/workflows/ralph-amend-goal.md) — read only for `--amend`
</deferred_reading>

<purpose>
Apply retry, confidence, drift, goal-audit and stopping policy over the exact current Session chain of a durable topic Session. Ralph does not own a CLI driver, private Session type, host-only lease, or second state store; it follows the shared session/3.0 Run loop. Primary path: locate and drive an existing Session. Opening a Session is a fallback when no compatible identity exists.
</purpose>

<pi_context_contract>

- Consume the injected Topic Session resolution and ReuseAssessment as read-only routing evidence.
- Accept upstream only from same-Session sealed outputs.
- Resolve each `argument_requirements` entry through `required`, `missing`, `type`, `source`, optional `default`, and `question`.
- Treat the birth packet as compact routing; load the execution protocol from `brief.command`.
- A completion hint with `suggest_only=true` is displayed and never executed implicitly.

</pi_context_contract>

<interface>
Only these user flags are accepted:

- `-y` — skip all confirmation/clarification interactions, use default choices. Does NOT change data semantics (no auto-deferred decisions). Never bypasses: high-risk classification, confidence <60, ambiguity requiring user input, failed gates, or drift escalation.
- `-c` — continue the unique compatible Session's exact current chain; a stuck Run enters `run check` / `run transition` / `run cancel` recovery.
- `--amend` — amend the exact current Session objective/definition-of-done; remaining text is the change request.

All remaining text is intent. No engine, roadmap, script, depth, role, tier, platform, resume or dry-run flags are parsed. Those choices belong to Skill contracts and Runtime.
</interface>

<invariants>
1. **Ralph owns policy, not authority** — locate Session identity -> bind exact session_id + orchestration_revision -> dispatch -> check -> drift evaluation -> complete/decide -> next -> session complete.
2. **One executor per Run** — dispatch one unnamed `run-executor`; nested execution strategy belongs to the Skill.
3. **Thin executor** — executor executes and checks one Run but never receives the private claim or completes it.
4. **Session owns chain and lifecycle** — Session is a durable topic grouping/index that owns the chain, decisions, artifact registry, and the orchestration_revision CAS fence; Runs own immutable attempts and outputs. There is no Execution, no lease, no pause/resume/seal.
5. **Canonical upstream map** — same-Session sealed outputs enter only through birth/brief; no manual context reconstruction.
6. **Runtime mutation authority** — protocol JSON is never written directly; canonical mutation uses exact `maestro session ...` / `maestro run ...` commands and `run-response/1.2` envelopes.
7. **Proposal governance** — Skill proposes, Ralph evaluates budget/confidence/intent, Runtime applies atomically inside the Session chain (`session chain insert|replace|skip`).
8. **No prompt fix templates** — fix/review/goal gaps dispatch a Skill that may emit a proposal.
9. **Decision receipts are single-source** — decisions land through fenced `maestro run decide`, never direct append.
10. **Auto is bounded** — `-y` cannot bypass high risk, confidence <60, ambiguity, escalation, failed gates or reground halt.
11. **Legacy compatibility is out of band** — Session lifecycle aliases are allowed only by the labeled `session/1.x` branch in the shared loop.
12. **Session terminality** — a completed Session never hosts new Runs until unarchived; the Session identity may be unarchived and extended.
13. **Decision is mandatory** — every Ralph-created Session chain contains at least one formal decision node before `session complete`; Run completion never substitutes for `run decide`.
14. **Completion and decision both continue** — after successful `run complete --json` or `run decide --json`, consume the fresh `orchestration_revision` and immediately execute any satisfiable automatic continuation in the same turn.
15. **Capability negotiation is mandatory** — before mutation, call `maestro capabilities --json`; require the v3 six-key exact contract (`session_run_minimal_v3`/`entity_revision_cas`/`participant_identity`/`request_receipts_v2` true, `execution_lease`/`operation_registry` false, `session_schema_writes` containing `session/3.0`, `execution_schema_writes` empty, `run_response_writes` containing `run-response/1.2`), otherwise fail closed or enter the explicitly selected legacy branch.
</invariants>

<actions>

All command syntax and lifecycle mechanics follow `orchestrator-run-loop.md` and `run-mode.md`. The actions below define only Ralph-specific policy decisions.

### A_RESOLVE

Read-only lookup via `run recall`. Explicit birth `session_id + run_id` wins. Multiple candidates require user selection; historical similarity never grants authority.

### A_INFER

Classify `lifecycle_position` from evidence in this order:

1. An explicit request for grill, brainstorm or blueprint selects that entry.
2. Outside those three pre-project entries, a missing Maestro project structure selects init.
3. Reusable sealed outputs from the same Session may skip only the stages they satisfy: verified analysis without a plan selects plan; a verified plan without implementation selects execute; verified implementation selects the first applicable review/test stage.
4. Without reusable same-Session evidence, bounded work starts at analyze. Work whose scope is itself unresolved starts at analyze-macro.

Code presence, historical similarity from another Session, or a stage name mentioned only as an example never proves lifecycle completion. Set `wants_roadmap=true` only for an explicit roadmap request or evidence of at least 2 independently releasable milestones; file count alone is insufficient.

Record `lifecycle_position`, `wants_roadmap`, supporting evidence and every skipped stage with its reason. Ambiguous evidence is carried into A_ASSESS rather than silently choosing a later stage.

### A_DECOMPOSE

Derive one boundary contract and outcome-oriented goal set before building the chain:

```json
{
  "boundary_contract": {
    "in_scope": [],
    "out_of_scope": [],
    "constraints": [],
    "definition_of_done": ""
  },
  "decomposition": {
    "execution_criteria": [],
    "goals": [
      {
        "id": "G1",
        "goal": "",
        "boundary": "",
        "done_when": "",
        "evidence": "",
        "lifecycle": [],
        "status": "pending"
      }
    ],
    "changelog": []
  }
}
```

Work is broad when it affects at least 3 modules, changes a cross-package interface, or leaves at least 2 of scope/constraints/done criteria unresolved. Ask at most 3 boundary questions; `-y` cannot invent answers for broad ambiguity. Narrow work may use the intent as its single `in_scope` item, but still requires an observable `definition_of_done`.

Every goal must describe a user-visible or verifiable outcome, map to at least one `in_scope` item, name concrete evidence in `done_when`/`evidence`, and list only lifecycle stages that can produce that evidence. Reject empty goals, stage-named goals, duplicate IDs and goals with no evidence path.

### A_ASSESS

Produce a creation assessment with `risk`, `risk_reasons`, `confidence_score`, `confidence_reasons` and `unresolved_questions`.

- `high` risk: destructive or irreversible operations; production/release mutation; authentication, authorization or sensitive-data changes; data/schema migration without a proven rollback; or backward-incompatible public contract changes.
- `medium` risk: multi-module behavior, compatible API/schema changes, new dependencies, concurrency/state-machine changes, or migrations with a verified rollback.
- `low` risk: isolated reversible work with existing patterns and a known verification path.

Compute confidence from 100 and clamp to 0–100. Apply each applicable penalty once: −30 unresolved scope/constraint/done criterion; −20 ambiguous lifecycle position; −20 missing or stale required upstream evidence; −15 unverified cross-module integration assumption; −15 unknown test or verification path. Cite evidence for every deduction.

Confidence maps to low `<60`, medium `60–79`, high `≥80`. High risk always requires confirmation. Confidence below 60 cannot enter S_RUN_LOOP until the missing evidence or ambiguity is resolved; `-y` never bypasses either gate.

### A_BUILD

Consume the outputs of A_INFER, A_DECOMPOSE and A_ASSESS; do not re-infer them while assembling the chain. Quality is quick/standard/full based on specs and observable risk, not a user flag. Quality criteria: quick = single-file + existing tests; standard = multi-file + new logic; full = cross-module + no existing coverage.

Build the chain from `prepare/ralph.md` Stage Mapping. If the Stage Mapping or Build Rules are not in context, Read `prepare/ralph.md` directly (it is in required_reading) — in v3 the same prepare guidance is injected into the `run next` / `run create` birth packet (`guidance-snapshot/1.0`); prepare is embedded in the Run, not a standalone `run prepare` step. Propagate goal references, map the current host to the Skill scanner's `target_platform` (`claude|codex|agent|agy|pi`), and prevalidate every command with `maestro skills --steps --json --platform pi`. Never default a non-Claude host to `claude`; `pi` resolves Skills from the installed `pi-maestro-flow` npm package's `package.json#pi.skills` directories. Every chain includes at least one final quality/goal/scope decision node before `session complete`; long chains also include periodic reground decision nodes. Step execution strategy is defined by each Skill, never by Ralph flags.

### A_EXECUTE

Follow `orchestrator-run-loop.md` exactly. Display identity may use stage prefixes, but no private agent name or Ralph progress file is persisted. Task/Goal UI is projection only.

### A_EVALUATE

Follow `orchestrator-run-loop.md` "4. Decision Step"; the VERDICT format is defined in `prepare/ralph.md`. Ralph policy thresholds:

- Confidence mapping: low = <60, medium = 60-79, high = ≥80.
- Confidence below 60 → cannot proceed.
- Retry budget exhaustion → escalate.
- Goal audit: compare every pending goal's `done_when` against evidence; missing evidence means unmet.
- Reground: compare cumulative handoffs against intent and boundary; confident drift halts even under `-y`. drift = cumulative handoffs deviate from ≥2 boundary_contract.in_scope items or introduce ≥1 out_of_scope item; confident drift = drift detected with confidence ≥80%.

### A_FAIL

- Repairable failure → verdict `needs-retry`; re-dispatch only after Runtime returns the step to pending (via `run transition`/`run cancel`).
- External or exhausted blocker → apply the receipt's structured `continuation` with the fully fenced `run transition ... blocked` or `run cancel` form from `orchestrator-run-loop.md`; the chain step stays pending for a later fenced `run next`. There is no Execution lease to release.
- Never allocate a new Run while the previous Run is running or gate-blocked.

### A_RECOVER

Only explicit `-c` enters recovery. Follow `orchestrator-run-loop.md` "5. Recovery and Amend" exactly.

### A_AMEND

Read `ralph-amend-goal.md`. High risk always asks. Pending-tail changes come from a planning Skill proposal, not direct edit.

### A_DONE

When every Run is sealed, every decision is terminal, every goal is done, no request is claimed, and the chain is complete -> `maestro session complete` with the exact `session_id + orchestration_revision`. Session identity remains reusable.

</actions>

</state_machine>

<success_criteria>
- Public flags are exactly `-y`, `-c`, `--amend`.
- No legacy Ralph driver, private Session type, or independent Skills CLI appears in normal flow.
- Each Run (`run/3.0`) follows `run next` -> execute -> `run check` -> fenced `maestro run complete --verdict --advance`; backtracking uses `run brief`. Every decision uses fenced `run decide`.
- Final completion uses `maestro session complete`; Session identity is never permanently sealed in the canonical branch.
- Proposal acceptance is pathless from Ralph's perspective and atomic with Run completion.
- Retry, confidence, drift, goal audit, recovery and terminal semantics remain explicit.
</success_criteria>
