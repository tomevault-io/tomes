- `background: false` is the default. Use foreground dispatch whenever the result determines the current answer or next action.
- Use `background: true` only for independent work. If this turn must consume a background result, call `observe` exactly once with `action: "wait"` and a bounded timeout before continuing; never continue independently while the result is pending.
- Otherwise end the turn and wait for the automatic `teammate-complete` notification. Do not rely on `SendMessage`, `team_msg`, or hook callbacks as completion signals.
- Never silently ignore an unfinished dispatch.

# Team Coordinate

Universal team coordination skill: analyze task -> generate role-specs -> dispatch -> execute -> deliver. Only the **coordinator** is built-in. All worker roles are **dynamically generated** as lightweight role-spec files and spawned via the `team-worker` agent.


## Architecture

```
+---------------------------------------------------+
|  Skill(skill="team-coordinate")                 |
|  args="task description"                           |
+-------------------+-------------------------------+
                    |
         Orchestration Mode (auto -> coordinator)
                    |
              Coordinator (built-in)
              Phase 0-5 orchestration
                    |
    +-------+-------+-------+-------+
    v       v       v       v       v
 [team-worker agents, each loaded with a dynamic role-spec]
  (roles generated at runtime from task analysis)

  CLI Tools (callable by any worker):
    teammate({ agent: "general", taskType: "analysis" })  - analysis and exploration
    teammate({ agent: "general", taskType: "development" })     - code generation and modification
```

## Shared Constants

| Constant | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Session prefix | `TC` |
| Session path | `{run_dir}/work/team/` |
| Worker agent | `team-worker` |
| Message bus | `mcp__maestro__team_msg(session_id=<run-id>, ...)` |
| CLI analysis | `teammate({ agent: "general", taskType: "analysis" })` |
| CLI write | `teammate({ agent: "general", taskType: "development" })` |
| Max roles | 5 |

## Role Router

This skill is **coordinator-only**. Workers do NOT invoke this skill -- they are spawned as `team-worker` agents directly.

### Input Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`. No `--role` needed -- always routes to coordinator.

### Role Registry

Only coordinator is statically registered. All other roles are dynamic, stored as role-specs in session.

| Role | File | Type |
|------|------|------|
| coordinator | [roles/coordinator/role.md](roles/coordinator/role.md) | built-in orchestrator |
| (dynamic) | `{run_dir}/work/team/role-specs/<role-name>.md` | runtime-generated role-spec |

### CLI Tool Usage

Workers can use CLI tools for analysis and code operations:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| teammate({ agent: "general", taskType: "analysis" }) | Analysis, exploration, pattern discovery |
| teammate({ agent: "general", taskType: "development" }) | Code generation, modification, refactoring |

### Dispatch

Always route to coordinator. Coordinator reads `roles/coordinator/role.md` and executes its phases.

### Orchestration Mode

User just provides task description.

**Invocation**: `Skill(skill="team-coordinate", args="task description")`

**Lifecycle**:
```
User provides task description
  -> coordinator Phase 1: task analysis (detect capabilities, build dependency graph)
  -> coordinator Phase 2: generate role-specs + initialize session
  -> coordinator Phase 3: create task chain from dependency graph
  -> coordinator Phase 4: spawn first batch workers (background) -> STOP
  -> Worker executes -> teammate-complete notification -> coordinator advances next step
  -> Loop until pipeline complete -> Phase 5 report + completion action
```

**User Commands** (wake paused coordinator):

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `check` / `status` | Output execution status graph, no advancement |
| `resume` / `continue` | Check worker states, advance next step |
| `revise <TASK-ID> [feedback]` | Revise specific task with optional feedback |
| `feedback <text>` | Inject feedback into active pipeline |
| `improve [dimension]` | Auto-improve weakest quality dimension |

## Coordinator Spawn Template

### v2 Worker Spawn (all roles)

When coordinator spawns workers, use `team-worker` agent with role-spec path:

```
teammate({ agent: "team-worker", tasks: [{ taskType: "<task_type>", name: "<role>", prompt: `## Role Assignment
role: <role>
role_spec: {run_dir}/work/team/role-specs/<role>.md
session: {run_dir}/work/team
session_id: <run-id>
team_name: <team-name>
requirement: <task-description>
inner_loop: <true|false>

## Progress Milestones
session_id: <run-id>
Report progress via team_msg at natural phase boundaries (context loaded -> core work done -> verification).
Report blockers immediately via team_msg type="blocker".
Report completion via team_msg type="task_complete" after final SendMessage.

Read role_spec file to load Phase 2-4 domain instructions.
Execute built-in Phase 1 (task discovery) -> role-spec Phase 2-4 -> built-in Phase 5 (report).`, description: "Spawn <role> worker" }], background: true })
```

**Inner Loop roles** (role has 2+ serial same-prefix tasks): Set `inner_loop: true`. The team-worker agent handles the loop internally.

**Single-task roles**: Set `inner_loop: false`.

---

## Completion Action

When pipeline completes (all tasks done), coordinator presents an interactive choice:

```
ask user ({
  questions: [{
    question: "Team pipeline complete. What would you like to do?",
    header: "Completion",
    multiSelect: false,
    options: [
      { label: "Archive & Clean (Recommended)", description: "Archive session, clean up team" },
      { label: "Keep Active", description: "Keep session for follow-up work" },
      { label: "Export Results", description: "Export deliverables to target directory, then clean" }
    ]
  }]
})
```

### Action Handlers

| Choice | Steps |
|--------|-------|
| Archive & Clean | Update session status="completed" -> TeamDelete -> output final summary with artifact paths |
| Keep Active | Update session status="paused" -> output: "Resume with: Skill(skill='team-coordinate', args='resume')" |
| Export Results | AskUserQuestion(target path) -> copy artifacts to target -> Archive & Clean |

  "task_description": "<original user input>",
  "status": "active | paused | completed",
  "team_name": "<team-name>",
  "roles": [

  },

  "completed_tasks": [],
  "completion_action": "interactive",
  "created_at": "<timestamp>"
}
```

---

## Session Resume

Coordinator supports `resume` / `continue` for interrupted sessions:

1. Scan `{run_dir}/work/team/team-session.json` for active/paused sessions
2. Multiple matches -> user prompt for selection
3. Audit TaskList -> reconcile session state <-> task status
4. Reset in_progress -> pending (interrupted tasks)
5. Rebuild team and spawn needed workers only
6. Create missing tasks, set dependencies via TaskUpdate({ addBlockedBy })
7. Kick first executable task -> Phase 4 coordination loop

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| Unknown command | Error with available command list |
| Dynamic role-spec not found | Error, coordinator may need to regenerate |
| Command file not found | Fallback to inline execution |
| CLI tool fails | Worker proceeds with direct implementation, logs warning |
| Explore cache corrupt | Clear cache, re-explore |
| Fast-advance spawns wrong task | Coordinator reconciles on next callback |
| capability_gap reported | Coordinator generates new role-spec via handleAdapt |
| Completion action fails | Default to Keep Active, log warning |
