# Dependency Upgrade Skill

Detect outdated dependencies, verify security and maturity, remove unnecessary packages,
upgrade safely, and create a PR.

## Overview

The malgo project has four categories of dependencies:

| Category | Files | How to check | How to update |
|----------|-------|--------------|---------------|
| Haskell packages | `package.yaml`, `cabal.project.freeze` | `cabal outdated --freeze-file` | Edit freeze / regenerate |
| GitHub Actions | `.github/workflows/*.yml` | `gh api` to check latest releases | Update SHA + version comment |
| mise toolchain | `mise.toml` | `mise outdated` | `mise use <tool>@<version>` |
| Nix flake inputs | `flake.lock` (if present at root) | `nix flake update --dry-run` | `nix flake update` |

## Prerequisites

Before starting any dependency work, run these setup commands:

```bash
mise trust    # Approve mise permissions (required in fresh environments / subagents)
cabal update  # Refresh the Hackage index — this updates the local index-state
```

`cabal update` is essential because `cabal outdated` compares against the local index.
Without it, you're comparing against a stale snapshot and will miss available updates.

## Step-by-step workflow

### 1. Audit unnecessary dependencies

Before upgrading anything, check whether each dependency in `package.yaml` is actually
used. Removing unneeded dependencies shrinks the attack surface and reduces build time.

#### How to detect unused Haskell dependencies

Check all dependency sections in `package.yaml`:
- Top-level `dependencies:` (library deps)
- `tests:` section `dependencies:` (test-only deps)
- `build-tools:` (build tools like `happy`, `ormolu`)

For each package, search the source code for imports from that package. Use these heuristics:

| Package | Expected import pattern |
|---------|----------------------|
| `aeson` | `import Data.Aeson` |
| `lens` | `import Control.Lens` |
| `megaparsec` | `import Text.Megaparsec` |
| `effectful` | `import Effectful` |
| (etc.) | Check Hackage for the package's module names |

```bash
grep -r "import.*ModuleName" src/ app/ test/
```

If zero hits are found for a dependency, it is a removal candidate. Some packages are
trickier — they may be used only as build-tool plugins (like `effectful-plugin`) or
provide orphan instances loaded implicitly. Flag these for the user to confirm.

For build-tools, check if the tool is actually invoked. For example, `happy` processes
`.y` files — if no `.y` files exist in the repo, it's likely unused. Similarly, check
test-only dependencies by searching only in `test/`.

#### Removal process

1. Remove the package from `package.yaml` `dependencies:` (or move to test-only if
   only used in tests)
2. Run `hpack && cabal build` to verify compilation
3. If build fails, check which modules need the package and decide:
   - If few usages exist, consider replacing with standard library equivalents
   - If heavily used, keep the dependency
4. Run `mise run test` to verify no runtime breakage

Present removal candidates to the user with a brief rationale before removing.

### 2. Detect outdated dependencies

Run detection for each category. Present results as a consolidated table.

#### Haskell

```bash
cabal outdated --freeze-file
```

This compares `cabal.project.freeze` against the Hackage index. Also check if the
`index-state` in `cabal.project.freeze` is stale (more than ~2 weeks old).

If `cabal outdated` is not available or errors, fall back to manually comparing
key packages in `package.yaml` against Hackage.

#### GitHub Actions

For each `uses:` line in `.github/workflows/*.yml` that pins to a SHA:
1. Extract the owner/repo and current SHA/tag
2. Use `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest` to find the latest release
3. Use `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/ref/tags/{tag}` to get the SHA for the new tag
4. Flag any actions where the pinned version is behind latest

#### mise

```bash
mise outdated
```

Pay attention to GHC version changes — major GHC upgrades (e.g., 9.12 → 9.14) are
breaking and should be flagged separately from patch updates.

#### Nix flake

Only if a `flake.nix` exists at the project root:
```bash
nix flake update --dry-run
```

### 3. Security and maturity verification

This is the most critical step. Do not skip it. Every upgrade candidate must pass
these checks before being applied.

#### 3a. Security advisory check

For **Haskell packages**, check:
- Haskell Security Advisory Database: search https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories
  for the package name using `gh api` or `gh search issues`
- Hackage package page changelog and metadata for security-related notes

```bash
gh search issues --repo haskell/security-advisories "<package-name>" --json title,url,state
```

For **GitHub Actions**, check:
- GitHub Security Advisories for the action's repository
- Whether the repository has had any recent suspicious commits or ownership changes

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/security-advisories --jq '.[].summary'
```

For **Nix flake inputs**, check the upstream project's security advisories.

#### 3b. Supply chain attack indicators

Before adopting any new version, look for these red flags:

**For Haskell packages:**
- **Maintainer change**: Compare the `maintainer` field between the current and new
  version on Hackage. A sudden change in maintainer is a yellow flag — investigate.
  ```
  curl -s https://hackage.haskell.org/package/<pkg>-<old-ver>/<pkg>.cabal | grep -i maintainer
  curl -s https://hackage.haskell.org/package/<pkg>-<new-ver>/<pkg>.cabal | grep -i maintainer
  ```
- **Unusual dependency additions**: If the new version adds dependencies that seem
  unrelated to the package's purpose (e.g., a parser library suddenly depending on
  `network` or `process`), flag it.
- **Upload timing**: A release published in the last 48 hours with no prior beta/RC
  and no changelog entry is suspicious. Prefer versions that have been on Hackage for
  at least 1-2 weeks.

**For GitHub Actions:**
- **Repository transfer**: Check if the action's repository was recently transferred
  to a different owner. `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}` and look at `created_at` vs
  the account's age.
- **Force-pushed tags**: If a tag's SHA differs from what release notes reference,
  the tag may have been moved. Always resolve the SHA yourself:
  ```bash
  gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/ref/tags/{tag} --jq '.object.sha'
  ```
- **Commit verification**: Prefer actions whose release commits are signed.
  ```bash
  gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/commits/{sha} --jq '.verification.verified'
  ```

**For all categories:**
- If anything looks off, **stop and report to the user** rather than proceeding.

#### 3c. Release maturity check

Avoid bleeding-edge releases. Apply these minimum age thresholds:

| Risk level | Minimum age since release |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Patch (x.y.Z) | 3 days |
| Minor (x.Y.0) | 1 week |
| Major (X.0.0) | 2 weeks |

To check release age:

**Hackage:**
```bash
curl -s "https://hackage.haskell.org/package/<pkg>/preferred.json"
```
Or check the upload timestamp on the Hackage package page.

**GitHub Actions:**
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest --jq '.published_at'
```

If a release is younger than the threshold, flag it and suggest waiting or pinning
to the previous stable version.

### 4. Present findings and get approval

Show the user a comprehensive summary table:

```
Category        | Package/Action          | Current   | Latest    | Risk   | Security | Age     | Action
----------------|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|--------
Haskell         | lens                    | 5.3.4     | 5.3.5     | low    | clean    | 3 weeks | upgrade
Haskell         | effectful               | 2.6.1.0   | 2.7.0.0   | medium | clean    | 2 weeks | upgrade
Haskell         | some-pkg                | 1.0.0     | 1.0.1     | low    | ⚠ new maintainer | 2 days | HOLD
GitHub Actions  | actions/checkout        | v6.0.1    | v6.0.2    | low    | clean    | 1 month | upgrade
Haskell         | unused-pkg              | 0.5.0     | -         | -      | -        | -       | REMOVE
```

Risk levels:
- **low**: patch version bump
- **medium**: minor version bump
- **high**: major version bump

Suggest a default scope (typically all low+medium with clean security and sufficient
age, holding anything flagged), but **do not apply anything yet** — proceed to Gate A.

### 4.5. Gate A — Confirmation before applying changes (HARD STOP)

**This is a mandatory stop. Do not proceed past this gate without explicit user
approval, even when running under Auto Mode.** Auto Mode's "execute immediately"
default does not override this gate — dependency upgrades are not "low-risk routine
work" and require human review.

What to do at this gate:

1. After presenting the table from §4, **stop and wait** for the user to say which
   candidates to apply. Acceptable approval signals are explicit phrases like
   "apply", "go ahead", "approve", "proceed", or an enumerated subset of candidates.
   Silence or ambiguity is **not** approval.
2. If the user's intent is unclear (e.g., they say "looks good" without specifying
   scope), use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm the exact set to apply.
3. Confirm the scope before any file modification: which removals, which version
   bumps, which Action SHA updates, and whether to also push / open a PR later.
4. Do **not** run `cabal freeze`, edit `package.yaml`, edit workflow files, or
   create a branch until approval is given.

Once approval is received, proceed to §5.

### 5. Apply upgrades

#### Haskell freeze file update

1. Run `cabal update` (this refreshes the local Hackage index to the latest state)
2. Delete the old `index-state` line from `cabal.project.freeze`
3. Run `cabal freeze` to regenerate the freeze file (it will use the latest index-state)
4. If the freeze fails due to version conflicts, try relaxing constraints in
   `cabal.project` and report to the user

Important: after freezing, run `hpack && cabal build` to verify the build works.

#### GitHub Actions

For each action to update:
1. Look up the new release tag and its commit SHA via `gh api`
2. Verify the SHA matches what the release references
3. Replace the old SHA with the new one
4. Update the version comment (e.g., `# v6.0.1` → `# v6.0.2`)

Format: `uses: owner/repo@<full-sha> # v<tag>`

#### mise

Update `mise.toml` directly. For tools pinned to `"latest"`, no change is needed —
they auto-resolve. For tools with explicit versions (like GHC), update the version string.

After updating, run `mise install` to verify.

#### Nix flake

```bash
nix flake update
```

### 6. Verify

Run the project's standard verification:

```bash
mise run build && mise run test
```

If tests fail:
- Check if golden test outputs need resetting (`mise run reset` then re-run tests)
- Check for API changes in upgraded packages
- Report failures to the user before proceeding

### 6.5. Gate B — Confirmation before pushing & creating the PR (HARD STOP)

**This is a second mandatory stop. Do not push the branch or create a PR without
explicit user approval, even when running under Auto Mode.** Pushing and opening
a PR are externally visible actions and must not be taken on assumption.

What to do at this gate:

1. It is fine to create local commits on a feature branch (so the user can review
   `git log` / `git diff`), but **do not** run `git push` or `gh pr create` yet.
2. Show the user:
   - The branch name you intend to push
   - The list of commits (`git log --oneline master..HEAD`)
   - The drafted PR title and body (paste it inline so they can edit it)
3. Wait for an explicit go-ahead like "push", "open the PR", "create PR",
   "looks good — ship it". A vague "thanks" is not approval.
4. If the user wants edits to the PR description, branch name, or commits, apply
   them and re-confirm before proceeding.
5. Only after approval, run `git push -u origin <branch>` and `gh pr create`.

### 7. Create PR

Create a branch and PR using `gh`:

- Branch name: `chore/deps-upgrade-YYYY-MM-DD`
- Commit message format (Conventional Commits):
  - Removals: `refactor(deps): remove unused <pkg>`
  - Upgrades: `chore(deps): upgrade dependencies`
  - Security fixes: `fix(deps): upgrade <pkg> to fix <advisory>`
- PR body should list:
  - Dependencies removed (with rationale)
  - Dependencies upgraded (with version changes)
  - Security notes (any advisories addressed, any flags encountered)
  - Verification results

Use separate commits for removals vs upgrades. Follow the project's Conventional
Commits format.

## Important notes

- **Always stop for explicit user approval at the two gates** (Gate A in §4.5
  before applying changes, Gate B in §6.5 before pushing & creating the PR).
  These gates are mandatory **even under Auto Mode** — the "execute immediately"
  default does not extend to dependency upgrades or PR creation. Treat silence,
  vague acknowledgement ("ok", "thanks"), or implicit consent as **not approved**
  and ask again with `AskUserQuestion`.
- **Never upgrade GHC major version without explicit user approval** — this can break
  the entire build and requires careful migration.
- **The `allow-newer` field in `cabal.project`** may need adjustment when upgrading.
  Currently it has `allow-newer: text`. Check if this is still needed after upgrading.
- **The existing CI workflow** (`haskell-deps-update.yml`) handles lower bound bumps
  automatically. This skill is for comprehensive upgrades beyond what that workflow covers.
- **Always verify SHA hashes** for GitHub Actions — don't just trust tag names, as tags
  can be moved. Use `gh api` to resolve the actual commit SHA for a tag.
- **When in doubt, hold** — it is always safer to skip a suspicious upgrade and report
  findings to the user than to apply it.
