# Version Control & Git Workflow Skill

Guide users through professional version control practices using Git with trunk-based development, Conventional Commits, and GitHub integration.

## Core Philosophy

**Trunk-Based Development:**
- Keep main branch always deployable
- Short-lived feature branches (days, not weeks)
- Frequent integration to main
- Small, incremental changes
- Continuous integration mindset

**Conventional Commits:**
- Structured, semantic commit messages
- Enables automated tooling (changelogs, versioning)
- Clear intent and scope in history
- Searchable, filterable commits

**GitHub Integration:**
- Pull requests for code review
- Branch protection for main
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Clear PR descriptions and discussions

## Trunk-Based Development Workflow

### The Main Branch
- **Always deployable** - Main branch should always be in working state
- **Protected** - Require PRs, reviews, passing CI
- **Source of truth** - All branches stem from and merge back to main
- **No long-lived branches** - Avoid develop, staging branches

### Feature Branch Workflow

**1. Start from main:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/user-authentication
```

**2. Make small, focused changes:**
- One feature/fix per branch
- Commit frequently with Conventional Commits
- Keep branch lifespan short (1-3 days ideal)

**3. Stay synchronized:**
```bash
# Update from main frequently
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feat/user-authentication
git rebase main  # Keep history linear
```

**4. Push and create PR:**
```bash
git push -u origin feat/user-authentication
# Create PR on GitHub
```

**5. After PR approval:**
```bash
# Squash merge or merge commit to main
# Delete feature branch immediately
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feat/user-authentication
```

### Branch Naming Conventions

**Pattern: `<type>/<short-description>`**

Types match Conventional Commit types:
- `feat/add-oauth-login` - New feature
- `fix/authentication-timeout` - Bug fix
- `refactor/database-queries` - Code refactoring
- `docs/api-endpoints` - Documentation
- `test/user-service` - Tests only
- `chore/update-dependencies` - Maintenance

Keep descriptions short, lowercase, hyphen-separated.

## Conventional Commits

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Required:** type, subject
**Optional:** scope, body, footer

### Types

**feat:** New feature for users
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication
```

**fix:** Bug fix
```
fix(api): handle null response in user endpoint
```

**docs:** Documentation changes
```
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

**style:** Code style/formatting (no logic change)
```
style(components): fix indentation in Button
```

**refactor:** Code restructuring (no behavior change)
```
refactor(database): extract query builder class
```

**perf:** Performance improvement
```
perf(images): implement lazy loading
```

**test:** Adding or updating tests
```
test(auth): add integration tests for login flow
```

**build:** Build system or dependencies
```
build(deps): upgrade React to v18.2
```

**ci:** CI/CD configuration
```
ci(github): add automated deployment workflow
```

**chore:** Maintenance tasks
```
chore(deps): update development dependencies
```

**revert:** Revert previous commit
```
revert: revert "feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication"
```

### Scope

Optional but recommended. Indicates what part of codebase changed:
- `feat(api):` - API changes
- `fix(ui):` - UI fix
- `refactor(database):` - Database refactoring
- `feat(auth):` - Authentication feature

Use project-specific scopes that make sense for your codebase.

### Subject Rules

- Use imperative mood: "add" not "added" or "adds"
- No capitalization of first letter
- No period at the end
- Keep under 50 characters
- Complete the sentence: "If applied, this commit will..."

**Good:**
```
feat(api): add user profile endpoint
fix(auth): prevent token expiration race condition
```

**Bad:**
```
feat(api): Added user profile endpoint.
fix(auth): Fixes a bug
Update stuff
```

### Body (Optional)

- Explain **what** and **why**, not **how**
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Separate from subject with blank line
- Use bullet points for multiple points

```
feat(search): implement full-text search

- Add PostgreSQL full-text search indexes
- Create search API endpoint with pagination
- Implement search result ranking by relevance

This enables users to search across all content with better
performance than previous LIKE queries.
```

### Footer (Optional)

**Breaking changes:**
```
feat(api): change authentication endpoint

BREAKING CHANGE: /auth/login moved to /api/v2/auth/login
```

**Issue references:**
```
fix(ui): prevent modal from closing on backdrop click

Fixes #123
Closes #456
```

### Examples

**Simple feature:**
```
feat(dashboard): add user activity chart
```

**Bug fix with details:**
```
fix(api): handle network timeout errors

Previously, network timeouts would crash the application.
Now we catch timeout errors and return appropriate error
response to client.

Fixes #789
```

**Breaking change:**
```
feat(api)!: redesign user authentication

BREAKING CHANGE: Auth tokens now expire after 1 hour instead
of 24 hours. Clients must implement token refresh logic.
```

**Multiple changes:**
```
refactor(database): optimize query performance

- Add indexes on frequently queried columns
- Implement connection pooling
- Cache common queries with Redis
- Update ORM configuration for better performance

These changes reduce average query time from 200ms to 50ms.
```

See `references/conventional-commits.md` for comprehensive guide.

## Essential Git Commands

### Daily Commands

**Check status:**
```bash
git status                    # See working tree status
git diff                      # Show unstaged changes
git diff --staged            # Show staged changes
```

**Make commits:**
```bash
git add <file>               # Stage specific file
git add .                    # Stage all changes
git commit -m "type: message" # Commit with message
git commit                   # Open editor for commit message
```

**Sync with remote:**
```bash
git pull origin main         # Fetch and merge from main
git push origin <branch>     # Push branch to remote
git fetch origin            # Fetch without merging
```

**Branch management:**
```bash
git branch                   # List local branches
git branch -a               # List all branches (including remote)
git checkout -b <branch>    # Create and switch to branch
git checkout <branch>       # Switch to existing branch
git branch -d <branch>      # Delete local branch
```

### Workflow Commands

**Update feature branch from main:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feat/my-feature
git rebase main             # Keep linear history
# Resolve conflicts if any
git push --force-with-lease origin feat/my-feature
```

**Amend last commit:**
```bash
git commit --amend          # Edit last commit message/content
git commit --amend --no-edit # Add changes to last commit
```

**Unstage changes:**
```bash
git reset HEAD <file>       # Unstage file
git reset HEAD .           # Unstage all
```

**Discard changes:**
```bash
git checkout -- <file>      # Discard changes in file
git restore <file>         # Modern alternative
git clean -fd              # Remove untracked files/dirs
```

**Stash changes:**
```bash
git stash                   # Stash working changes
git stash push -m "message" # Stash with message
git stash list             # List stashes
git stash apply            # Apply most recent stash
git stash pop              # Apply and remove stash
git stash drop             # Remove stash
```

**View history:**
```bash
git log                     # Show commit history
git log --oneline          # Compact history
git log --graph            # Visual branch graph
git log -p                 # Show patches
git log --follow <file>    # Follow file history
```

**Compare branches:**
```bash
git diff main..feat/branch  # Changes in branch vs main
git log main..feat/branch   # Commits in branch not in main
```

See `references/git-commands.md` for complete command reference.

## GitHub Pull Request Workflow

### Creating a PR

**1. Push branch:**
```bash
git push -u origin feat/user-authentication
```

**2. Create PR on GitHub with:**

**Title:** Use Conventional Commit format
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication
```

**Description template:**
```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of changes and motivation.

## Changes
- List key changes
- Use bullet points
- Be specific

## Testing
How to test these changes:
1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Expected behavior

## Screenshots (if UI changes)
[Add screenshots]

## Checklist
- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No breaking changes (or documented)
- [ ] Follows Conventional Commits
```

**3. Request reviewers**
**4. Link related issues**

### Reviewing PRs

**As reviewer:**
- Check code quality and style
- Verify tests are adequate
- Test functionality locally
- Ask questions, suggest improvements
- Approve or request changes

**PR review checklist:**
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Changes are well-tested
- [ ] No unnecessary changes included
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Commit messages follow Conventional Commits
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Performance implications considered

### Addressing Review Feedback

**1. Make requested changes:**
```bash
# Make changes in your branch
git add .
git commit -m "fix(auth): address PR feedback"
git push origin feat/user-authentication
```

**2. Respond to comments**
**3. Mark conversations as resolved**
**4. Request re-review**

### Merging PRs

**Merge strategies:**

**Squash and merge (recommended for most features):**
- Combines all commits into one
- Clean main branch history
- Loses detailed commit history
- Good for: Features with many small commits

**Merge commit (for collaborative branches):**
- Preserves all commits
- Shows branch history
- Can clutter main history
- Good for: Complex features with meaningful commit history

**Rebase and merge (for clean branches):**
- Applies commits directly to main
- Linear history
- Requires clean branch history
- Good for: Branches with well-crafted commits

**After merge:**
```bash
# Delete remote branch (or use GitHub auto-delete)
git push origin --delete feat/user-authentication

# Update local main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Delete local branch
git branch -d feat/user-authentication
```

See `references/github-workflow.md` for detailed GitHub guidance.

## Branch Protection Rules

**Configure on GitHub for main branch:**

**Required:**
- [x] Require pull request before merging
- [x] Require approvals (at least 1)
- [x] Require status checks to pass
- [x] Require branches to be up to date

**Recommended:**
- [x] Require conversation resolution
- [x] Require linear history
- [x] Do not allow bypassing settings
- [x] Automatically delete head branches

**Optional (for teams):**
- [ ] Require review from Code Owners
- [ ] Restrict push access
- [ ] Require signed commits

## Handling Merge Conflicts

### When conflicts occur

**During merge:**
```bash
git merge main
# CONFLICT in file.py
```

**During rebase:**
```bash
git rebase main
# CONFLICT in file.py
```

### Resolution process

**1. View conflicts:**
```bash
git status  # Shows conflicted files
```

**2. Open conflicted file:**
```python
<<<<<<< HEAD
# Your changes
=======
# Their changes
>>>>>>> main
```

**3. Resolve manually:**
- Choose one version, or
- Combine both, or
- Write new solution

**4. Mark as resolved:**
```bash
git add file.py
```

**5. Continue operation:**
```bash
# For merge:
git commit

# For rebase:
git rebase --continue
```

**6. Abort if needed:**
```bash
# For merge:
git merge --abort

# For rebase:
git rebase --abort
```

### Preventing conflicts

- Pull/rebase from main frequently
- Keep branches short-lived
- Coordinate with team on overlapping work
- Make small, focused changes

See `references/troubleshooting.md` for complex conflict scenarios.

## Common Workflows

### Starting New Feature

```bash
# 1. Ensure main is current
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feat/new-feature

# 3. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat(module): add new functionality"

# 4. Push and create PR
git push -u origin feat/new-feature
# Create PR on GitHub
```

### Quick Bug Fix

```bash
# 1. Create fix branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b fix/bug-description

# 2. Fix and commit
git add .
git commit -m "fix(module): resolve bug description"

# 3. Push and create PR
git push -u origin fix/bug-description
# Create PR with "Fixes #issue-number"
```

### Updating Branch from Main

```bash
# Option 1: Rebase (preferred for clean history)
git checkout feat/my-feature
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
# Resolve conflicts if any
git push --force-with-lease origin feat/my-feature

# Option 2: Merge (preserves branch history)
git checkout feat/my-feature
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
git push origin feat/my-feature
```

### Splitting Large Branch

```bash
# If branch too large, split into smaller PRs:

# 1. Create first sub-feature
git checkout -b feat/user-auth-part1 feat/user-auth
git rebase -i main  # Mark only first commits as pick
git push -u origin feat/user-auth-part1
# Create PR for part 1

# 2. After part 1 merges, continue with part 2
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/user-auth-part2 feat/user-auth
# Continue with remaining commits
```

## Git Best Practices

### Commit Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Commit frequently (multiple times per day)
- Keep commits focused (one logical change)
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Follow Conventional Commits format
- Test before committing
- Review changes before committing (`git diff`)

❌ **Don't:**
- Commit broken code to main
- Make giant commits with unrelated changes
- Write vague messages ("fix stuff", "updates")
- Commit commented-out code
- Commit sensitive data (secrets, credentials)
- Force push to main

### Branch Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Keep branches short-lived (days not weeks)
- One feature/fix per branch
- Use descriptive branch names
- Delete branches after merging
- Rebase/merge from main frequently
- Keep main always deployable

❌ **Don't:**
- Create long-lived feature branches
- Mix multiple features in one branch
- Push directly to main (without PR)
- Leave stale branches
- Let branches get too far behind main

### Collaboration Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Pull before starting work
- Communicate about overlapping work
- Review others' PRs promptly
- Provide constructive feedback
- Respond to review comments
- Use PR templates
- Link issues in PRs

❌ **Don't:**
- Work on main directly
- Force push to shared branches (without communication)
- Approve PRs without reviewing
- Ignore CI failures
- Merge your own PRs without review

### Repository Hygiene

✅ **Do:**
- Use `.gitignore` properly
- Keep repository clean
- Document in README
- Tag releases
- Archive old branches
- Use GitHub releases

❌ **Don't:**
- Commit build artifacts
- Commit dependencies (unless necessary)
- Commit IDE-specific files
- Commit large binary files
- Let main branch diverge from production

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I committed to wrong branch"

```bash
# Move commit to new branch
git branch feat/new-branch    # Create branch at current commit
git reset --hard HEAD~1       # Remove commit from current branch
git checkout feat/new-branch  # Switch to new branch
```

### "I need to undo last commit"

```bash
# Keep changes, undo commit
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo commit and changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Undo but keep as uncommitted
git reset HEAD~1
```

### "I committed sensitive data"

```bash
# Remove from last commit
git rm --cached <file>
git commit --amend
git push --force-with-lease

# Remove from history (use tools like BFG Repo-Cleaner)
# Then rotate any exposed secrets!
```

### "My branch diverged from main"

```bash
# Rebase to fix
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
# Resolve conflicts
git push --force-with-lease origin feat/my-branch
```

### "I need to change commit message"

```bash
# Last commit only
git commit --amend

# Older commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3  # For last 3 commits
# Change 'pick' to 'reword' for commits to change
```

### "Rebase went wrong"

```bash
# Abort and start over
git rebase --abort

# Or if already messed up
git reflog  # Find previous state
git reset --hard <previous-commit>
```

See `references/troubleshooting.md` for more scenarios.

## Advanced Git Topics

### Interactive Rebase

```bash
# Rebase last 3 commits interactively
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Options:
# pick - keep commit
# reword - change commit message
# edit - pause to amend commit
# squash - combine with previous commit
# fixup - like squash but discard message
# drop - remove commit
```

### Cherry-Pick

```bash
# Apply specific commit to current branch
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# Cherry-pick multiple commits
git cherry-pick <commit1> <commit2>

# Cherry-pick range
git cherry-pick <start>..<end>
```

### Reflog (recover lost commits)

```bash
# View reference log
git reflog

# Find lost commit
git reflog show HEAD

# Restore to previous state
git reset --hard HEAD@{2}
```

### Bisect (find bug-introducing commit)

```bash
# Start bisect
git bisect start
git bisect bad              # Current commit is bad
git bisect good <commit>    # Last known good commit

# Git will checkout middle commit, test it
git bisect good  # If works
git bisect bad   # If broken

# Repeat until found
git bisect reset  # Return to original state
```

### Worktrees (work on multiple branches)

```bash
# Create worktree for different branch
git worktree add ../project-feature feat/feature

# List worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove worktree
git worktree remove ../project-feature
```

See `references/advanced-git.md` for detailed coverage.

## GitHub Actions Integration

### Basic CI Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  push:

        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install
        run: npm ci
      - name: Test
        run: npm test
      - name: Lint
        run: npm run lint
```

### Conventional Commit Validation

```yaml
# .github/workflows/commit-lint.yml
name: Commit Lint

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  lint-commits:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
