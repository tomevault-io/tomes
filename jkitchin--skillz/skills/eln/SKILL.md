# Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) Skill

This skill provides expert guidance for maintaining professional electronic lab notebooks using org-mode, following best practices for scientific documentation, reproducibility, and research integrity.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating or updating lab notebook entries
- Documenting experiments, calculations, or analyses
- Recording hypotheses and experimental design
- Documenting computational workflows
- Summarizing results and drawing conclusions
- Organizing research notes chronologically
- Creating cross-references between related work
- Preparing documentation for publications or reports
- Ensuring reproducibility of scientific work
- Maintaining professional research records

## Core Principles of Scientific Documentation

### 1. Chronological Organization
Entries are organized by date in a hierarchical structure:
```
notebook/
├── 2025/
│   ├── 01-January/
│   │   ├── 2025-01-15.org
│   │   └── 2025-01-20.org
│   └── 02-February/
│       └── 2025-02-03.org
```

### 2. Complete Documentation
Each entry should contain:
- **What was done**: Detailed description of work
- **Why it was done**: Hypothesis, motivation, reasoning
- **How it was done**: Methods, procedures, parameters
- **What was observed**: Results, data, observations
- **What it means**: Analysis, interpretation, conclusions
- **Next steps**: Follow-up work, questions raised

### 3. Reproducibility
Documentation should enable anyone (including future you) to:
- Understand the reasoning behind decisions
- Reproduce the work exactly
- Access all data and code used
- Follow the chain of logic

### 4. Professional Standards
- Write clearly and professionally
- Be honest about failures and unexpected results
- Date and timestamp all entries
- Never delete or modify past entries (make corrections with new entries)
- Include sufficient detail for independent reproduction

## Org-Mode ELN Structure

### File Organization

#### Date-Based Files
Each day's work goes in a dated file:
```
2025-01-15.org    # Single day's work
```

#### Directory Structure
```
research-notebook/

### 3. Data Analysis Entry

```org
* Analysis - Comparing Different Functionals
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: 2025-01-15-003
:PROJECT: Method_Validation
:STATUS: Complete
:END:

** Objective
Compare PBE, PBE+D3, and RPBE for CO adsorption energies.

** Data Sources
- PBE: [[file:2025-01-10.org::*PBE Results]]
- PBE+D3: [[file:2025-01-12.org::*Dispersion Results]]
- RPBE: [[file:2025-01-14.org::*RPBE Calculations]]

| PBE+D3     |     -2.15  |              -0.55 |
| RPBE       |     -1.45  |               0.15 |
#+TBLFM: $3=$2-(-1.6);%.2f

** Conclusions
- PBE gives reasonable agreement (within 0.22 eV)
- PBE+D3 overbinds significantly
- RPBE underestimates binding
- **Decision**: Use PBE for production calculations

** Impact on Previous Work
Need to note that PBE tends to overbind slightly when reporting results.

### 5. Problem/Debugging Entry

```org
* Troubleshooting - VASP SCF Convergence Issues
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: 2025-01-15-005
:TYPE: Problem
:STATUS: Resolved
:END:

** Problem
VASP calculation not converging after 100 SCF steps.

Error message:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
WARNING: Sub-Space-Matrix is not hermitian in DAV
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Attempted Solutions
1. Increased NELM to 200 - Still failed
2. Changed ALGO from Fast to Normal - No improvement
3. Reduced SIGMA from 0.2 to 0.1 - Failed
4. **Solution**: Used ISMEAR=0 (Gaussian smearing) instead of ISMEAR=1

** Root Cause
System has a band gap. Methfessel-Paxton smearing (ISMEAR=1) is inappropriate.
Gaussian smearing (ISMEAR=0) is better for molecules and systems with gaps.

** Resolution
Changed INCAR:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ISMEAR = 0
SIGMA = 0.05
#+END_EXAMPLE

Calculation converged in 45 SCF steps.

** Lessons Learned
- Always check if system has a gap before choosing smearing
- For molecules/insulators: Use ISMEAR=0 or ISMEAR=-5
- For metals: ISMEAR=1 or 2 is appropriate

## Best Practices

### 1. Daily Summaries
Start each file with a brief summary:
```org
* Daily Summary
Today focused on validating DFT functional choice for catalyst project.
Compared PBE, PBE+D3, and RPBE against experimental data. Concluded
that PBE gives best agreement. Started large-scale screening of FCC
metals.

Key accomplishment: Validated methodology for production runs.
Main challenge: VASP convergence issues with molecular systems (resolved).
```

### 2. Honest Documentation
```org
** Results
Expected: E_ads ≈ -1.5 eV
**Observed: E_ads = -0.45 eV**

This is significantly different from literature values.

** Analysis of Discrepancy
Possible causes:
1. Wrong adsorption site? → Checked: FCC is correct
2. Insufficient k-points? → Tested 8×8×1: -0.46 eV (no change)
3. Functional issue? → Literature used PBE, we used PBE
4. **Surface coverage?** → Our 1/16 ML vs literature 1/4 ML

** Resolution
Rerun with higher coverage to match literature conditions.
Original calculation still valid for low-coverage limit.
```

### 3. Version Control Integration
```org
** Computational Details
Code version: catalyst-tools v2.3.1
Git commit: a3f5e2b

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git log -1 --oneline
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: a3f5e2b Fix convergence criteria in optimizer

** Background
[Literature review, motivation]

** Approach
1. Validate methodology with Pt(111) benchmark
2. Screen FCC metals (Cu, Ag, Au, Pt, Pd, Ni)
3. Analyze trends using d-band model
4. Validate top candidates with experiments

** Success Criteria

- Complete by [2025-02-28]

** Initial Tasks
- [ ] Set up calculation framework
- [ ] Run Pt(111) benchmark
- [ ] Compare functionals
```

### Documenting Failure
```org
* Failed Attempt - NEB Calculation
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: 2025-01-15-006
:STATUS: Failed
:END:

** Objective
Calculate CO diffusion barrier on Pt(111).

** Approach
NEB with 7 images, climbing image method.

** Problem
Images diverged after 20 steps. Final image forces > 5 eV/Å.

** Analysis
Initial path guess was poor - CO moved through bulk instead of surface.

** Lessons Learned
- Need better initial path interpolation
- Check geometry of intermediate images before optimization
- Use more images (9-11) for surface diffusion

** Next Attempt
Will use improved path generation script and verify geometries.
Scheduled for [[file:2025-01-16.org][tomorrow]].
