# Troubleshooting & Debugging Skill

Guide users through systematic problem diagnosis and resolution using structured methodologies applicable to any domain.

## Quick Start Workflow

When a troubleshooting request arrives, follow this systematic approach:

1. **Understand** - What's expected vs actual, when started, what changed
2. **Gather** - Collect diagnostic information (logs, errors, environment, steps to reproduce)
3. **Hypothesize** - List possible causes ranked by probability
4. **Design** - Create tests that isolate variables
5. **Test** - Execute systematically, document results
6. **Identify** - Distinguish symptoms from root cause
7. **Verify** - Confirm fix resolves the issue
8. **Document** - Record solution for future reference

## When to Use This Skill

Activate for requests involving:
- "Debug this..." / "Troubleshoot..."
- "Why isn't this working..." / "Getting an error..."
- "Something's wrong with..." / "How do I fix..."
- Any problem description or malfunction report
- Unexpected behavior or failures
- Performance issues or degradation
- Intermittent problems

## Problem Understanding Phase

### Essential First Questions

Before diving into solutions, gather critical context:

**Problem Description:**
- What are you trying to do? (expected behavior)
- What's actually happening? (actual behavior)
- What error messages or symptoms do you see?
- Can you reproduce it consistently?

**Timeline:**
- When did this start?
- Did it ever work correctly?
- What changed recently? (code, config, environment, data, dependencies)

**Scope:**
- Does this happen every time or intermittently?
- Does it happen for everyone or just some users?
- Does it happen in all environments or just specific ones?

**Environment:**
- What system/platform/version?
- What's the configuration?
- What are the dependencies and their versions?

**Reproduction:**
- What are the exact steps to reproduce?
- Can you provide a minimal example that demonstrates the issue?
- What's the simplest case that fails?

### Problem Type Classification

Categorize to guide troubleshooting approach:

**By Consistency:**
- **Consistent** - Happens every time (easier to debug)
- **Intermittent** - Happens sometimes (harder, often timing/race conditions)
- **Progressive** - Gets worse over time (resource leaks, degradation)

**By History:**
- **Regression** - Worked before, broke recently (what changed?)
- **Never worked** - New feature/setup (design or setup issue)

**By Scope:**
- **Universal** - Happens everywhere (likely code/logic issue)
- **Environmental** - Happens in specific environment (config, dependencies, resources)
- **User-specific** - Happens for specific users (permissions, data, state)

**By Domain:**
- **Code/Logic** - Software bugs, algorithmic errors
- **Configuration** - Settings, parameters, environment variables
- **Data** - Input validation, corruption, format issues
- **Infrastructure** - Network, storage, resources, services
- **Integration** - API failures, service dependencies
- **Human process** - Workflow, communication, missing steps

Classification helps prioritize hypotheses and diagnostic approaches.

## Diagnostic Information Gathering

### Log and Error Analysis

**Error Messages:**
- Copy exact error text (don't paraphrase)
- Note error code/type if provided
- Identify stack trace or error location
- Look for nested/chained errors (root cause often deeper)

**Log Examination:**
- Check timestamps (when did issue occur)
- Look for ERROR, WARN, EXCEPTION entries near failure time
- Trace request/operation ID through logs
- Check for patterns (repeating errors, sequences)
- Review logs before failure (what was system doing)

**System State:**
- Resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Process/service status
- Recent restarts or crashes
- System event logs

### Environment Documentation

Capture complete environment picture:

**Versions:**
- Application/service version
- Runtime/interpreter version (Node, Python, Java, etc.)
- OS version
- Dependency versions (libraries, packages)
- Database/cache versions

**Configuration:**
- Config files and their values
- Environment variables
- Feature flags or toggles
- Settings that differ from defaults

**Infrastructure:**
- Network topology
- Service endpoints and connectivity
- Firewall/security rules
- Load balancers, proxies
- DNS configuration

### Reproduction Case Development

**Goal**: Find minimal reproducible example (MRE)

**Process:**
1. Document exact steps from clean state
2. Strip away non-essential steps
3. Minimize data/input to simplest case
4. Remove dependencies where possible
5. Verify it still reproduces

**Good reproduction case:**
- Anyone can follow steps and see same issue
- Minimal (fewest steps, smallest data)
- Self-contained (no external dependencies if possible)
- Deterministic (reproduces consistently)

See `references/information-gathering.md` for detailed techniques.

## Hypothesis Generation

### Forming Testable Hypotheses

**Generate possibilities:**
- Brainstorm what could cause observed symptoms
- Consider each problem type (code, config, data, infrastructure)
- Review known failure patterns for this domain
- Don't self-censor - list everything plausible

**Rank by probability:**
- Most likely causes first
- Consider base rates (common vs rare failures)
- Factor in recent changes
- Weight by evidence strength

**Make hypotheses testable:**
- "If X is the cause, then Y should be true"
- Design specific test that would confirm/refute
- Ensure test is practical to execute

**Example hypotheses (ranked):**
1. **High probability:** Recent config change introduced typo → Check config against previous version
2. **Medium probability:** Dependency version mismatch → Verify all dependencies match working environment
3. **Low probability:** Hardware failure → Run diagnostics, check system logs for hardware errors

### Common Failure Patterns

**Code/Logic:** Off-by-one, null/undefined, type mismatch, logic errors, unhandled edge cases, race conditions

**Configuration:** Typos, wrong environment variables, permissions, path issues, missing settings

**Data:** Invalid format, null/empty values, corruption, encoding issues, schema mismatch

**Infrastructure:** Network connectivity, port conflicts, insufficient resources, permissions, services, firewall

**Integration:** API changes, expired credentials, rate limiting, timeouts, version incompatibility

See `references/hypothesis-generation.md` and `references/domain-specific-patterns.md` for comprehensive patterns.

## Systematic Testing

### Scientific Method Principles

**Change one variable at a time:**
- Modify single factor per test
- Know exactly what you changed
- Document change and result
- Reset to baseline between tests

**Verify assumptions:**
- Don't assume anything works
- Test each layer (can you reach service? is it responding? is auth working?)
- Question "obvious" things
- Build confidence from known-good baseline

**Isolate variables:**
- Remove unnecessary components
- Test in controlled environment
- Disable features to narrow scope
- Use minimal configuration

**Document everything:**
- What you tested
- What you changed
- What happened (exact result)
- Conclusions drawn
- Next steps

Use `scripts/hypothesis_tracker.py` to maintain investigation log.

### Binary Search Troubleshooting

**Concept**: Divide problem space in half, determine which half contains issue, repeat.

**Applications:**
- **Version bisect:** Which commit introduced bug? (git bisect)
- **Config narrowing:** Which of 50 config settings causes issue?
- **Data range:** Which records in dataset cause failure?
- **Code sections:** Which function/module has the bug?
- **Time range:** When did problem start occurring?

**Process:**
1. Identify search space boundaries (working ↔ broken)
2. Test midpoint
3. Determine which half contains issue
4. Repeat with smaller range
5. Continue until isolated to specific element

**Example - Config debugging:**
- Start: All 50 config settings (broken)
- Disable half (25 settings) → Still broken
- Issue is in disabled half
- Disable half of those (12-13) → Works!
- Issue is in recently disabled set
- Continue narrowing...
- Result: Isolated to single problematic setting

Use `scripts/binary_search_helper.py` for interactive guidance.

### Differential Diagnosis

Compare working vs non-working cases to identify differences:

**Compare:**
- Configurations
- Environments
- Data inputs
- Dependencies
- Timing/sequence
- System state

**Look for:**
- What's present in failing case but not working case
- What's different between the two
- What versions differ
- What settings differ

**Technique:**
- Start with known-good case
- Progressively make it more like failing case
- Stop when you introduce the failure
- That change is the cause

## Root Cause Analysis

### 5 Whys Technique

Dig deeper by asking "why" repeatedly (typically 5 times):

**Example:**
1. **Problem:** Website is down
2. **Why?** Database connection failed
3. **Why?** Connection pool exhausted
4. **Why?** Connections not being released
5. **Why?** Code missing connection.close() in error path
6. **Why?** Developer didn't know about finally blocks
7. **Root cause:** Missing error-handling training, missing code review checklist

**Guidelines:**
- Each "why" should be factual (not speculative)
- Stop when you reach actionable root cause
- May need more or fewer than 5 whys
- Focus on process/system causes, not blaming people

### Distinguishing Symptoms from Root Cause

**Symptom:** Observable manifestation of problem
**Root Cause:** Underlying reason problem exists

**Example:**
- **Symptom:** Application crashes
- **Symptom:** Out of memory error
- **Symptom:** Memory leak in caching module
- **Root Cause:** Cache eviction policy not implemented

**Test:** Would fixing this prevent all instances of the problem?
- If no → It's a symptom, keep digging
- If yes → Likely root cause

**Verify:**
- Fix the root cause
- Test that all symptoms disappear
- Verify issue doesn't recur

See `references/diagnostic-frameworks.md` for Fishbone diagrams and FMEA.

## Troubleshooting Principles

**Core Principles:**

1. **Reproduce before fixing** - If you can't reproduce it, you can't verify the fix

2. **Change one thing at a time** - Otherwise you won't know what fixed it

3. **Verify assumptions** - "It should work" ≠ "It does work"

4. **Start with simple explanations** - Occam's Razor (common problems are common)

5. **Follow the data** - Believe logs/evidence over intuition

6. **Work from known-good baseline** - Establish what works, then build up

7. **Document as you go** - Your future self will thank you

8. **Know when to stop** - Time-box investigation, escalate if stuck

9. **Avoid confirmation bias** - Look for evidence that disproves your hypothesis too

10. **Treat the disease, not symptoms** - Fix root cause, not just visible symptoms

## Domain-Specific Guidance

**Software/Code:** Syntax errors, logic bugs, runtime errors, concurrency issues, memory problems
- Use debugger, add logging, rubber duck debugging, review changes, check typos

**System/Infrastructure:** Network, permissions, services, ports, resources, configuration
- Check service status, test connectivity, review logs, verify config, check resources

**Process/Workflow:** Missing steps, unmet dependencies, communication gaps, timing issues
- Map actual vs expected process, identify handoffs, check prerequisites

See `references/domain-specific-patterns.md` for comprehensive diagnostic approaches by domain.

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Change multiple things at once** - You won't know what fixed it
❌ **Assume without verifying** - "It worked last week" doesn't mean it works now
❌ **Skip reproduction** - Can't verify fix without reproducing first
❌ **Pursue only favorite hypothesis** - Confirmation bias blinds you
❌ **Give up on intermittent issues** - Often most critical
❌ **Forget to document** - Others will duplicate your work
❌ **Treat symptoms not root cause** - Suppressing errors doesn't fix problems
❌ **Blame the user** - Stops investigation prematurely
❌ **Rush to solution** - Premature fixes waste time

## Solution Verification

**After implementing fix:**

1. **Test reproduction case** - Does it now work?

2. **Test edge cases** - Does fix work in all scenarios?

3. **Regression check** - Did fix break anything else?

4. **Performance check** - Did fix introduce performance issues?

5. **Monitor in production** - Watch for recurrence or side effects

6. **Verify with users** - Confirm issue is resolved from their perspective

## Documentation

**Document for future:**

**Troubleshooting Log:**
- Problem description
- Investigation steps
- Hypotheses tested
- Results of each test
- Root cause identified
- Solution implemented

Use `assets/templates/troubleshooting_log_template.md`

**Root Cause Analysis Report:**
- Executive summary
- Problem statement
- Timeline of events
- Root cause analysis (5 Whys, Fishbone)
- Corrective actions
- Preventive measures

Use `assets/templates/rca_report_template.md`

**Reproduction Steps:**
- Minimal reproduction example
- Prerequisites
- Step-by-step instructions
- Expected vs actual results

Use `assets/templates/reproduction_steps_template.md`

## When to Escalate

**Know when to ask for help:**

- You've exhausted reasonable hypotheses
- Issue is outside your domain expertise
- Problem is time-critical and investigation is taking too long
- You need access/permissions you don't have
- Problem appears to be in external system
- You've been going in circles (revisiting same hypotheses)

**Before escalating:**
- Document what you've tried
- Share reproduction case
- Provide all diagnostic information
- Explain your hypothesis and reasoning
- Suggest what help you need
