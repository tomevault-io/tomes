# Scientific Writing

Systematic guidance for writing research papers, grants, and scientific communications with
emphasis on clarity, reproducibility, and adherence to field conventions.

## Scientific Writing Workflow

### 1. Identify Document Type and Requirements

Determine what you're writing:
- Research article → Full paper with novel findings
- Review article → Synthesis of existing literature
- Grant proposal → Funding application
- Conference abstract → Brief standalone summary
- Revision response → Reply to peer reviewers
- Technical report → Documentation of work

Gather venue requirements:
- Target journal/conference/funder name
- Word/page limits by section
- Citation style required
- Figure/table format specifications
- Submission guidelines and templates

### 2. Select Structure and Route to Guidance

For research articles:
- Use IMRAD structure (see references/paper-structure.md)
- Introduction: references/introduction-writing.md
- Methods: references/methods-writing.md
- Results: references/results-writing.md
- Discussion: references/discussion-writing.md
- Abstract: references/abstract-writing.md

For review articles:
- See references/review-writing.md for thematic organization
- Focus on synthesis, not chronological listing
- Critical evaluation of literature

For grant proposals:
- See references/grant-writing.md for funder-specific guidance
- Specific Aims structure
- Significance, Innovation, Approach

For revision responses:
- See references/revision-response.md for point-by-point format
- Diplomatic language and tracking changes

### 3. Write Section by Section

Follow section-specific guidance:

Introduction (references/introduction-writing.md)
- Funnel structure: Broad → Narrow → Gap → Objective
- Establish context and importance
- Identify knowledge gap
- State clear objective

Methods (references/methods-writing.md)
- Reproducibility is paramount
- Include all essential details: equipment, reagents, software, statistics
- Organize chronologically or by subsystem
- Past tense, field-appropriate voice

Results (references/results-writing.md)
- Report observations objectively
- No interpretation (save for discussion)
- Integrate figures and tables
- Include statistical details
- Past tense

Discussion (references/discussion-writing.md)
- Interpret findings in context
- Compare with literature
- Acknowledge limitations honestly
- Discuss implications and future work
- Mix of present (facts) and past (your results)

### 4. Create Figures and Tables

Figures (references/figure-design.md)
- Match figure type to data type
- Publication quality: 300+ DPI, readable fonts, vector when possible
- Complete captions with all essential information
- Colorblind-friendly palettes

Tables (references/table-design.md)
- Use when precise values needed
- Clear headers with units
- Consistent decimal places
- Descriptive captions

Tools:
```bash
# Generate publication-quality figures
python scripts/figure_generator.py data.csv config.yaml --output fig1.pdf

# Format tables for journals
python scripts/table_formatter.py data.csv --format latex --journal nature
```

### 5. Manage Citations and References

Citation formatting (references/citation-management.md)
- Match journal's required style:
  - Numbered: [1], [2,3], [1-5]
  - Author-year: (Smith, 2020; Jones, 2021)
  - Author-number: Smith (1)
- Check all in-text citations have references
- Check all references are cited
- Consistent formatting throughout

Tools:
```bash
# Validate citation consistency
python scripts/citation_checker.py manuscript.docx --style apa
```

### 6. Improve Clarity and Conciseness

Language clarity (references/language-clarity.md)
- Active voice preferred (field norms vary)
- Concise: remove filler words and redundancies
- Precise: avoid vague terms ("very," "quite," "many")
- One main idea per sentence
- Logical paragraph flow

Tools:
```bash
# Analyze readability
python scripts/readability_analyzer.py section.txt

# Count words by section
python scripts/word_counter.py manuscript.docx
```

### 7. Review Against Requirements

Pre-submission checklist:
- [ ] Word limits met for each section
- [ ] All figures/tables referenced in text
- [ ] All citations formatted consistently
- [ ] Statistical details complete
- [ ] Methods reproducible
- [ ] Limitations discussed
- [ ] Abstract within word limit
- [ ] Keywords selected
- [ ] Author contributions stated
- [ ] Conflicts of interest disclosed
- [ ] Data availability statement
- [ ] Ethics approvals included

## Document Type Routing

### Research Article → IMRAD Structure

Structure overview (references/paper-structure.md)

IMRAD sections:
- /I/ntroduction: Background, gap, objective
- /M/ethods: Reproducible experimental details
- /R/esults: Objective observations with data
- /A/nd
- /D/iscussion: Interpretation, implications, limitations

What goes where:
- Introduction: Why this work matters, what's unknown, what you'll do
- Methods: How you did it (enough detail to reproduce)
- Results: What you found (observations, not interpretations)
- Discussion: What it means, how it fits, what's next

Common mistakes to avoid:
- ❌ Interpretation in results section
- ❌ New results in discussion section
- ❌ Methods scattered in results
- ❌ Missing gap identification in introduction
- ❌ Ignoring limitations

### Review Article → Thematic Organization

See references/review-writing.md

Types:
- Narrative review: Broad overview
- Systematic review: Structured search (PRISMA)
- Meta-analysis: Quantitative synthesis

Key principles:
- Synthesize thematically, not chronologically
- Critical evaluation, not just summary
- Identify patterns, gaps, controversies
- Future directions

### Grant Proposal → Funder-Specific Structure

See references/grant-writing.md

Common elements:
- Specific Aims (1 page): Clear, testable objectives
- Significance: Why it matters, current knowledge, impact
- Innovation: What's novel about approach
- Approach: Methods, timeline, pitfalls, alternatives
- Preliminary data: Feasibility demonstration

Review criteria alignment:
- Address all criteria explicitly
- Use headings matching criteria
- Make reviewers' job easy

### Revision Response → Point-by-Point

See references/revision-response.md

Structure:
- Thank reviewers
- Summary of major changes
- Point-by-point responses with line numbers
- Track changes in manuscript

Response strategies:
- Agree and comply: Describe changes made
- Agree but can't comply: Explain why, offer alternative
- Disagree: Provide evidence diplomatically

## Section-Specific Guidance

### Introduction Writing

See references/introduction-writing.md

Funnel structure:
1. Broad context (why general topic matters)
2. Narrow to specific problem area
3. Identify gap in knowledge
4. State objective of this work
5. Brief approach overview (optional)

Length: Typically 1-3 pages

Tense: Present for established facts, past for previous studies

### Methods Writing

See references/methods-writing.md

Reproducibility checklist:
- Equipment: manufacturer, model, specs
- Reagents: source, catalog #, concentration
- Software: name, version, parameters
- Statistical tests with corrections
- Sample size justification
- Ethics approvals

Organization:
- Chronological (when order matters)
- By subsystem (complex systems)
- By measurement type (multiple assays)

Detail level:
- Standard procedures: Brief + citation
- Novel procedures: Full detail
- Modified procedures: Highlight changes

### Results Writing

See references/results-writing.md

Objectivity principles:
- Report observations, not interpretations
- "Data show" not "data prove"
- Present negative results honestly
- Save interpretation for discussion

Statistical reporting:
- Test statistic, df, exact p-value
- Effect sizes and confidence intervals
- Multiple comparison corrections
- Measures of variability (SD, SE, CI)

Figure integration:
- Reference every figure/table in text
- Describe key finding from each
- Don't just say "see Figure X"

### Discussion Writing

See references/discussion-writing.md

Structure:
1. Restate main findings (brief)
2. Interpret in context of literature
3. Compare with previous work
4. Explain unexpected findings
5. Acknowledge limitations
6. Discuss implications
7. Suggest future directions

Limitations:
- Be honest but not self-defeating
- Explain impact of limitations
- Suggest how to address
- Don't introduce obscure limitations

### Abstract Writing

See references/abstract-writing.md

Essential elements:
- Background (1-2 sentences)
- Objective
- Methods (brief approach)
- Results (key findings with data)
- Conclusions (significance)

Word limit strategies:
- Typical: 150-300 words
- Prioritize results and conclusions
- Remove modifiers
- Define abbreviations sparingly
- No citations (usually)

Self-contained requirement:
- Understandable without reading paper
- Include actual data, not just "significant"

## Universal Scientific Writing Principles

### 1. Clarity Over Complexity

- Simple words over complex when meaning is same
- Short sentences preferred
- One idea per sentence
- Active voice when possible (field norms vary)
- Define specialized terms

### 2. Precision in Language

- Specific numbers over vague terms
- "Approximately 50%" not "many"
- Distinguish "significant" (statistical) from "important"
- Clear about causation vs correlation
- Avoid hedging excessively ("relatively," "quite," "very")

### 3. Objectivity in Reporting

- Separate observations (results) from interpretations (discussion)
- Present negative results honestly
- Acknowledge contradictory evidence
- Don't overstate conclusions
- Appropriate level of certainty

### 4. Reproducibility in Methods

- Include all information needed to reproduce
- Equipment specifications
- Exact concentrations and conditions
- Statistical methods fully described
- Software versions and parameters
- Code availability when applicable

### 5. Logical Flow of Argument

- Each section builds on previous
- Clear transitions between ideas
- Coherent narrative throughout
- Introduction sets up discussion
- Discussion answers introduction's questions

### 6. Appropriate Detail for Audience

- Assume audience has field background
- Define specialized terms first use
- Balance between too much and too little detail
- Don't explain fundamental concepts
- Do explain novel techniques or applications

## Tense and Voice Usage Guide

### Tense by Section

Introduction:
- Present: Established facts ("DNA is composed of...")
- Past: Previous studies ("Smith et al. showed...")
- Present: Your objective ("This study investigates...")

Methods:
- Past: What you did ("Cells were cultured...")
- Past: ("We cultured cells...")

Results:
- Past: Your findings ("Expression increased...")
- Past: ("We observed increased expression...")

Discussion:
- Past: Your results ("Our data showed...")
- Present: Established facts ("This gene regulates...")
- Present: Interpretations ("These results suggest...")

Conclusions:
- Present: General conclusions ("This approach provides...")

### Voice by Field

Biology/Medicine:
- More passive acceptable in methods
- Either active or passive in other sections

Engineering/Computer Science:
- Active voice preferred throughout
- "We designed..." rather than "A design was created..."

Physics/Chemistry:
- Varies by journal and author preference
- Either acceptable if consistent

## Quick Reference - Common Issues

Results vs Discussion: Keep observations in results, interpretations in discussion

Citation Consistency: Use one style throughout (numbered [1] or author-year)

Figure References: Reference all figures/tables in text with findings, not just "see Figure X"

Statistical Reporting: Include test statistic, df, exact p-value, effect size, variability measure

Methods Detail: Include manufacturer, catalog #, concentrations for reproducibility

Limitations: Be honest but not self-defeating; explain impact, suggest solutions

See individual reference files for detailed examples and guidance.
