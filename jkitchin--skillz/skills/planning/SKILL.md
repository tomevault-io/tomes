# Planning & Project Breakdown Skill

Guide users through structured, realistic planning for projects, goals, and strategic initiatives using proven project management frameworks.

## Quick Start Workflow

When a planning request arrives, follow this systematic approach:

1. **Clarify**: Understand goal, constraints, deadline, resources
2. **Choose Approach**: Select planning methodology based on project type
3. **Decompose**: Break down into phases, milestones, and tasks
4. **Sequence**: Identify dependencies and critical path
5. **Estimate**: Set realistic timelines with buffers (20-30% for uncertain work)
6. **Define Success**: Establish milestones and success criteria
7. **Identify Risks**: Anticipate obstacles and plan mitigation
8. **Document**: Create clear, actionable plan

## When to Use This Skill

Activate for requests involving:
- "Help me plan..." / "Create a roadmap for..."
- "Break down this project..." / "What are the steps to..."
- "How should I approach..." / "Build a timeline for..."
- Strategic planning, project kickoff, goal setting

## Clarification Phase

Before planning, gather essential information:

**Goal & Scope**:
- What are you trying to achieve? (clear end state)
- What's in/out of scope?
- What would success look like?

**Constraints**:
- Deadline? Fixed or flexible?
- Resources available? (people, budget, tools)
- Dependencies? (external factors, approvals)
- Non-negotiables?

**Context**:
- Stakeholders? Decision makers?
- Past lessons learned?
- Similar projects to reference?

**Don't skip this**: 5 minutes of clarification saves hours later.

## Planning Approach Selector

Choose methodology based on project characteristics:

### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
**Use when**: Large, complex projects; scope unclear; need comprehensive task inventory

**Process**: Top-down decomposition (Project → Phases → Deliverables → Tasks)

**Best for**: Construction, IT projects, events, product launches

### Backward Planning
**Use when**: Fixed deadline; event planning; goal clear but path uncertain

**Process**: Start from end goal, work backwards identifying prerequisites

**Best for**: Event planning, product launches, campaigns, deadline-driven work

### Agile/Iterative Planning
**Use when**: Uncertain requirements; need flexibility; can deliver incrementally

**Process**: Plan in short iterations (sprints), adapt based on learning

**Best for**: Software development, research, new product development

### Phased/Milestone Planning
**Use when**: Long project (3+ months); need checkpoints; staged delivery

**Process**: Divide into phases with gates, plan phase-by-phase

**Best for**: Research, construction, strategic initiatives, transformation

### Hybrid Approach
**Combine methods**: WBS for decomposition + Agile for execution, etc.

See `references/frameworks-detailed.md` for detailed guides on each methodology.

## Core Frameworks (Concise)

### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

Hierarchical decomposition of work:

**Levels**: Project → Phases (3-7) → Deliverables → Tasks (1-3 days each) → Sub-tasks (if needed)

**100% Rule**: Each level represents 100% of parent's work

**Tips**:
- Nouns for deliverables, verbs for tasks
- Stop when tasks are 1-3 days
- 3-4 levels usually sufficient

### Backward Planning

**Process**:
1. Define end goal (what, when, success criteria)
2. Ask: "What must happen right before this?"
3. Continue backwards to present
4. Reverse sequence for forward plan
5. Add parallel tasks and dependencies
6. Estimate durations

**Key**: Be thorough with prerequisites - missing steps are common

### Critical Path Method

Identify longest sequence of dependent tasks (determines minimum duration):

**Concepts**:
- **Critical Path**: Tasks with zero slack (can't be delayed)
- **Float/Slack**: Time a task can delay without affecting project

**Use**: Focus management attention on critical path tasks

Use `scripts/critical_path.py` for calculation.

### Timeline Estimation

**Methods**:
- **Bottom-Up**: Estimate each task, sum up (most accurate)
- **Top-Down**: Estimate overall, allocate to phases (faster)
- **Three-Point**: (Optimistic + 4×Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6
- **Analogous**: Compare to similar past projects

**Key Principles**:
- Include 20-30% buffers for uncertain work
- Distinguish effort vs duration (40 hours work ≠ 40 hours elapsed)
- Account for capacity (people aren't 100% productive)
- Add contingency for risk mitigation

**Avoid**: Planning fallacy (underestimating), optimism bias

See `references/estimation-techniques.md` for detailed methods.

### Milestones & Success Criteria

**Good Milestones**:
- Specific, measurable, meaningful
- Time-bound, visible to stakeholders
- Represent significant progress

**Types**: Deliverable completion, decision point, event, phase completion

**Spacing**: Weekly (short projects), bi-weekly/monthly (medium), monthly/quarterly (long)

### OKR Framework (Objectives & Key Results)

**Structure**: 1 Objective + 3-5 Key Results

**Objective**: Qualitative, aspirational goal (what to achieve)

**Key Results**: Quantitative measures (how to measure success)

**Example**:
- Objective: Launch product successfully to market
- Key Results: 1000 active users first month; NPS 50+; $50K MRR by Q4 end

**Use for**: Strategic planning, not tactical tasks

### SMART Goals

**S**pecific - **M**easurable - **A**chievable - **R**elevant - **T**ime-bound

**Example**: "Increase NPS from 30 to 50 by Q4 end through improved onboarding"

**Use for**: Individual goals, small initiatives

## Dependencies & Sequencing

### Dependency Types

**Finish-to-Start** (most common): B starts when A finishes

**Start-to-Start**: B starts when A starts

**Finish-to-Finish**: B finishes when A finishes

### Identifying Dependencies

**Ask for each task**:
- What must complete before this starts?
- What can run in parallel?
- What's waiting for this?
- Any external dependencies?

**Categories**: Mandatory (technical), Discretionary (preference), External (outside control), Internal (team control)

### Parallelization

**Look for**:
- Tasks with no dependencies
- Tasks with same prerequisites
- Tasks that can be split

**Benefit**: Shorter duration, better resource use

**Caution**: Don't over-parallelize (coordination overhead)

## Risk Management (Brief)

### Identification

**Common categories**: Schedule, Technical, Resource, External, Scope, Quality

**Ask**: "What could go wrong?" Review past issues. Use pre-mortems.

### Assessment

**For each risk**: Probability (1-5) × Impact (1-5) = Risk Score

**Prioritize**: High-score risks for mitigation

### Response Strategies

- **Avoid**: Eliminate risk by changing plan
- **Mitigate**: Reduce probability or impact
- **Transfer**: Shift to another party (insurance, contracts)
- **Accept**: Monitor with contingency plan

See `references/frameworks-detailed.md` for risk register template.

## Resource Planning (Brief)

### Categories

**People**: Roles, skills, time commitment, availability

**Tools**: Software, hardware, procurement time

**Budget**: Personnel, tools, contingency (10-20%)

**Other**: Space, materials, information access

### RACI Matrix

**R**esponsible (does work) - **A**ccountable (ultimately accountable) - **C**onsulted (provides input) - **I**nformed (kept in loop)

See `references/templates.md` for RACI template.

## Planning Horizons

**Strategic** (Annual/Quarterly): Goals, themes, major initiatives. Tools: OKRs, roadmaps. Review quarterly.

**Tactical** (Monthly/Sprint): Deliverables, projects. Tools: WBS, sprint planning. Review weekly.

**Operational** (Weekly/Daily): Immediate tasks. Tools: Task lists, kanban. Review daily.

**Principle**: Plan detail should match certainty - detailed near-term, high-level long-term.

## Agile/Iterative Planning (Brief)

### Sprint Planning (2-week iterations)

1. Review prioritized backlog
2. Select items based on team capacity
3. Break items into tasks
4. Estimate and commit
5. Define sprint goal

### Iteration Reviews

- **Demo**: Show completed work
- **Retrospective**: What went well, what to improve
- **Adapt**: Adjust for next iteration

**Tips**: Keep iterations short (1-2 weeks). Don't skip retrospectives. Protect from disruptions.

See `references/templates.md` for sprint planning template.

## Contingency Planning

### Buffers

**Schedule**: 20-30% for uncertain work, more for novel/complex

**Resource**: 10-20% budget contingency, backup personnel

**Scope**: Prioritize features (must-have vs nice-to-have), have cut list

### Plan B

**For critical paths, ask**:
- What if this takes 2x longer?
- What if resources unavailable?
- What if dependency fails?

**Document**: Trigger points, alternatives, decision makers

### Monitoring & Adaptation

**Track**: Compare actual vs planned, identify variances early

**Re-plan when**: Assumptions wrong, scope changes, resource changes, risks occur

**Remember**: Plans are tools, not contracts. Adapt when reality differs.

## Documentation Formats

### Essential Plan Elements

1. Goal/Objective (what and why)
2. Scope (included/excluded)
3. Timeline (key dates, milestones)
4. Tasks/Phases (work breakdown)
5. Dependencies (critical path)
6. Resources (who, what needed)
7. Risks (identified + responses)
8. Success Criteria (measurements)

### Output Formats

**High-Level Plan**:
```
PROJECT: [Name]
GOAL: [What achieving]
TIMELINE: [Start] - [End]
OWNER: [Person]

PHASES:
1. Phase Name (dates) - Major deliverables
2. Phase Name (dates) - Major deliverables

MILESTONES:
- [Date]: Milestone
- [Date]: Milestone

TOP RISKS:
1. Risk [Mitigation]
2. Risk [Mitigation]
```

**Detailed Task List**:
```
TASK: [Description]
├─ Owner: [Person]
├─ Duration: [Estimate]
├─ Dependencies: [Prerequisites]
├─ Deliverable: [Output]
└─ Status: [Not started/In progress/Complete]
```

## Common Patterns

**Product Launch**: Backward plan from launch date, include dry-run, post-launch monitoring

**Research Project**: WBS + phased approach, exploratory time, iteration based on findings

**Event Planning**: Backward plan, critical path for venue/speakers, detailed day-of checklist

**Software Dev**: Agile sprints, testing in each iteration, deployment and monitoring

**Process Improvement**: Phased rollout, training/change management, measurement cycles

## Tips for Effective Facilitation

1. **Start with why** - Ensure goal clarity before methodology
2. **Right-size approach** - Don't over-plan simple projects
3. **Involve the team** - People doing work should help plan
4. **Plan iteratively** - Start high-level, refine progressively
5. **Include buffers** - Be realistic about uncertainty
6. **Make it visual** - Diagrams > text walls
7. **Assign ownership** - Every task needs owner
8. **Plan for learning** - First time takes longer
9. **Build in reviews** - Regular check-ins catch issues early
10. **Stay flexible** - Reality trumps plans
