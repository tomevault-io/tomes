# Skill: Mac Setup

Sets up a Mac for ButterCut. Two installation paths available based on user preference.

## Step 1: Check Current State

First, run the verification script to see what's already installed:

```bash
ruby .claude/skills/setup/verify_install.rb
```

If all dependencies pass, inform the user they're ready to go.

## Step 2: Ask User Preference

If dependencies are missing, use AskUserQuestion:

```
Question: "How would you like to install ButterCut?"
Header: "Install type"
Options:
  1. "Simple (recommended)" - "Fully automatic setup. We'll install everything for you using sensible defaults."
  2. "Advanced" - "For developers who want control. You manage Ruby/Python versions with your preferred tools."
```

## Step 3: Run Appropriate Setup

Based on user choice:

- **Simple**: Read and follow `.claude/skills/setup/simple-setup.md`
- **Advanced**: Read and follow `.claude/skills/setup/advanced-setup.md`

## Step 4: Verify Installation

After setup completes, run verification again:

```bash
ruby .claude/skills/setup/verify_install.rb
```

Report results to user.
