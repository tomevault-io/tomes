# Skill: Analyze Video

Add visual descriptions to audio transcripts by extracting JPG frames with ffmpeg and analyzing them. **Never read video files directly** - extract frames first.

## Prerequisites

Videos must have audio transcripts. Run **transcribe-audio** skill first if needed.

## Workflow

### 1. Copy & Clean Audio Transcript

Don't read the audio transcript, just copy it and then prepare it by using the prepare_visual_script.rb file. This removes word-level timing data and prettifies the JSON for easier editing:

```bash
cp libraries/[library]/transcripts/video.json libraries/[library]/transcripts/visual_video.json
ruby .claude/skills/analyze-video/prepare_visual_script.rb libraries/[library]/transcripts/visual_video.json
```

### 2. Extract Frames (Binary Search)

Create frame directory: `mkdir -p tmp/frames/[video_name]`

**Videos ≤30s:** Extract one frame at 2s
**Videos >30s:** Extract start (2s), middle (duration/2), end (duration-2s)

```bash
ffmpeg -ss 00:00:02 -i video.mov -vframes 1 -vf "scale=1280:-1" tmp/frames/[video_name]/start.jpg
```

**Subdivide when:** Footage start, middle and end have different subjects, setting or angle changes
**Stop when:** The footage no longer seems to be changing or only has minor changes
**Never sample** more frequently than once per 30 seconds

### 3. Add Visual Descriptions

Read the visual video json file that you created earlier.

**Read the JPG frames** from `tmp/frames/[video_name]/` using Read tool, then **Edit** `visual_video.json`:

Do these incrementally. You don't need to create a program or script to do this, just incrementally edit the json whenever you read new frames.

**Dialogue segments - add `visual` field:**
```json
{
  "start": 2.917,
  "end": 7.586,
  "text": "Hey, good afternoon everybody.",
  "visual": "Man in red shirt speaking to camera in medium shot. Home office with bookshelf. Natural lighting.",
  "words": [...]
}
```

**B-roll segments - insert new entries:**
```json
{
  "start": 35.474,
  "end": 56.162,
  "text": "",
  "visual": "Green bicycle parked in front of building. Urban street with trees.",
  "b_roll": true,
  "words": []
}
```

**Guidelines:**
- Descriptions should be 3 sentences max.
- First segment: detailed (subject, setting, shot type, lighting, camera style)
- Continuing shots: brief if similar, otherwise can be up to 3 sentences if drastically different.

### 4. Cleanup & Return

```bash
rm -rf tmp/frames/[video_name]
```

Return structured response:
```
✓ [video_filename.mov] analyzed successfully
  Visual transcript: libraries/[library]/transcripts/visual_video.json
  Video path: /full/path/to/video_filename.mov
```

**DO NOT update library.yaml** - parent agent handles this to avoid race conditions in parallel execution.
