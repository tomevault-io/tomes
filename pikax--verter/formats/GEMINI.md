# Verter

Verter is a Vue compiler and Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation. It converts Vue Single File Components (SFCs) to valid TSX (leveraging TypeScript for type checking) and compiles templates to optimized render functions. Unlike Volar, Verter generates actual valid TSX code rather than virtual files.

The project is a hybrid Rust + TypeScript monorepo: Rust crates handle template compilation (exposed via NAPI-RS native bindings and wasm-bindgen WASM) and the LSP server (`verter_lsp` binary, communicates over stdio), while TypeScript packages handle the SFC-to-TSX transformation and IDE integration.

## Architecture

### Shared Optimized Codebase (CRITICAL)

Verter is one shared optimized codebase, not separate semantic implementations per consumer.

- Improvements should land in the lowest reusable owner crate that can correctly serve all consumers.
- `verter_host` and shared workspace/VFS integration are the authority for host-backed loading, invalidation, dependency tracking, and cache reuse.
- `verter_analysis` and `verter_core` own reusable semantics and type-resolution logic.
- `verter_ffi` owns shared boundary DTOs between native bindings and WASM bindings.
- Consumer packages such as `@verter/component-meta`, the LSP, MCP, unplugin, and playground should consume the shared substrate rather than carrying their own semantic forks.

Architectural consequence:

- A performance or correctness fix discovered in one surface should be implemented in the shared owner layer whenever that behavior is reusable.
- Consumer-local wrappers should stay thin and should not bypass shared parsing, analysis, resolution, or cache ownership.

### Macro Type Traversal Rule (CRITICAL)

When resolving cross-file macro types (`defineProps<T>()`, `defineEmits<T>()`, component-meta deep expansion, etc.), only follow the import graph reachable from the requested type's declaration graph.

- There is one shared cross-file type resolver for host-backed component-meta and analysis work. Do not add consumer-specific resolver forks.
- That resolver has exactly two modes:
  - `Type`: resolve the requested symbol identity and canonical source location only. Do not expand the shape.
  - `Expanded`: resolve the same symbol through the same traversal, then materialize the expanded shape / expanded text.
- Component-meta uses the shared resolver in `Expanded` mode for every macro-facing surface. This includes all script-setup macros and all Options API surfaces that contribute metadata, such as props, data, computed, emits, slots, and expose-like members.
- Do not walk unrelated imports from the same file.
- Do not treat plain imports as implicit exports.
- Keep direct re-exports (`export { X } from`, `export * from`) as an explicit separate path.
- Parsing a `.ts`/`.js`/declaration file for type resolution must cache discovered symbol name → canonical location mappings.
- Re-exported names and barrel hops must also be cached once discovered. If traversal follows `export * from './foo'`, cache that result so later lookups do not rescan the same barrel chain.

If a file imports 20 modules but the requested macro type only references `AvatarProps` and `IconProps`, external resolution must only traverse those reachable dependencies.

**TS-first resolution priority:** TypeScript types always take priority over JavaScript files when resolving ambiguous dependency candidates. Verter is a type-strict compiler that relies on TS typing for correctness. JS files should only be used as a last resort when no TS type definition is available. When `DependencyResolution.possible_canonical_ids` contains multiple candidates, use `effective_target()` which selects the single highest-priority candidate: `.d.ts` > `.d.cts` > `.d.mts` > `.ts` > `.tsx` > `.js` > `.jsx` > `.cjs` > `.mjs`. Do not try remaining candidates if the selected one lacks the needed type — treat as not found.

### Canonical Dependency Cache Rule (CRITICAL)

Host-backed type/import resolution must treat the canonical file ID as the cache identity. The cache contract is:

- Load a dependency source at most once per canonical ID per workspace content generation. Parse it immediately and cache the raw source, parsed/OXC snapshot, and any reusable eval/build state right away.
- When the host materializes an imported dependency on a cold miss, derive the AST-backed bundle from that single parse and cache it together: file snapshot, eval env, external-type analysis, symbol/export lookup tables, and any other reusable per-file analysis. Do not let later resolver stages trigger a second parse of the same canonical file just to build another artifact.
- Cache named declarations from that parsed file by name, not just exported entrypoints. Internal named types/interfaces/aliases still matter because exported declarations in the same file may depend on them later.
- Treat named-node discovery as local symbol lookup. Once a file is parsed for a given canonical ID/version, future lookups should hit cached symbol/export maps instead of walking the full AST again to rediscover names.
- Treat AST ownership as single-pass work. For a given canonical ID/version, the resolver should do at most one full top-level AST walk to discover named symbols/exports, then cache those lookup entries and leave deeper expansion lazy per symbol. Do not rewalk the full file to rediscover the same symbol on later requests.
- Imported-file analysis should expose one shallow symbol graph keyed by `(canonical_id, symbol_name)`. That graph is the authoritative source for local symbol kind/span, local import targets, direct reexports, and local export aliases. Resolver stages must consume that graph instead of maintaining parallel rediscovery paths.
- Resolve the requested import from the cached parsed file first. If the requested name is not present, only then BFS through explicit barrel/re-export hops. Do not rescan the same file graph on the second request.
- Keep expansion lazy. We do not need to eagerly resolve every transitive type in a file up front. Preserve named references so later requests can expand them from cache when needed.
- Collected imported aliases stay shallow but must already be root-normalized. Store the defining file's canonical ID plus the final exported symbol name in `ImportedEvalInputs`; do not keep unresolved barrel routes once the root is known, and do not eagerly materialize a prepared declaration during collection.
- Builder-owned shallow imported aliases should treat their stored canonical ID as the defining-file root. They may consult cached barrel/export state only when a canonical root is still unknown. Cache the prepared alias on the defining canonical file and hydrate from that file's host cache or base eval env. Do not synthesize barrel-local prepared aliases for symbols that resolve to another file.
- Whole-file hashes are for long-lived update handling and cache validation, not for repeated warm reads. Compute/store the hash once for the current source version, then reuse it until the VFS reports a newer content generation / file version.
- VFS is the authority for file-change invalidation. When a canonical file’s version/hash changes, host caches derived from that canonical ID must be discarded together across source snapshots, parsed state, eval envs, and resolved-type/import caches.
- Legacy fallback paths that reparse or rewalk imported dependency files on warm requests should be removed, not preserved behind alternative code paths. Default behavior must go through the cache-aware host/VFS path.
- Imported dependency loading, type-resolution source materialization, and dependency canonical resolution should be host-owned single entry points. Do not add request-local cache layers or alternative parser/import paths on top of the host cache for the same work.
- Imported type root/declaration resolution and prepared imported-type alias caching should also be host-owned single entry points keyed by canonical ID plus current file version/hash. Do not rebuild the same imported symbol route or prepared alias body per request when the host cache already has it.

### Async File Scheduler (`verter_scheduler`)

The scheduler provides per-file async staging with priority queuing. Files progress independently through **Source → Analysis → Artifact** stages. Cross-file blocking (macro type deps, external `src`) is declarative — the scheduler manages wakeups.

**Key types** (`crates/verter_scheduler/src/`):

- `FileNode` (`node.rs`) — per-file: ArcSwap snapshots, AtomicU64 generation, pending requests
- `Scheduler` (`scheduler.rs`) — DashMap of FileNodes, JobIndex, SubmissionInbox, driver thread
- `CompletionHandle<T>` (`job.rs`) — request-scoped, resolves to Ready/Failed/Superseded/Shutdown
- `StageExecutor` (`executor.rs`) — trait for plugging host parse/analysis/compile logic
- `Priority` (`stage.rs`) — 4 tiers: Critical > Interactive > Background > Maintenance
- `EdgeManager` (`edges.rs`) — ReverseIndex + BlockerRegistry (both DashMap-sharded)
- `OverlayMap` (`overlay.rs`) — concurrent editor buffer storage (DashMap)
- `SourceLoader` (`source_loader.rs`) — MemorySourceLoader (tests/WASM) + DiskSourceLoader (native)
- `IoPool` (`pool.rs`) — bounded I/O thread pool, separate from rayon CPU pool

**Snapshot model**: All stage outputs are immutable `Arc`-wrapped. Replacement is atomic via ArcSwap. Generation fencing ensures coherence: `source.gen == analysis.gen == artifact.gen == node.gen`. Stale snapshots (gen mismatch) return `None` from `current_*()` methods.

**Host integration** (feature-gated `scheduler`): `VerterHost` holds an `Arc<Scheduler>`. During `upsert()`, the host populates both the legacy `files: Shared<FxHashMap>` and the scheduler in parallel. The `HostStageExecutor` calls real `parse_vue_snapshot`/`parse_non_sfc_snapshot` for the Source stage. Host-specific data is stored in snapshots via the `SnapshotData` trait (opaque `Arc<dyn Any>`), avoiding circular dependencies between scheduler and host.

**LSP integration**: `scheduler_integration.rs` maps LSP operations to priority tiers (Critical for hover/completion, Interactive for did_open/change, Background for workspace scan). `compile_blockers.rs` is deprecated — the scheduler's blocker model replaces imperative hydration.

### Two Template Codegen Paths (CRITICAL)

The Rust compiler has **two separate template codegen paths**. Modifying one does NOT affect the other:

| Path           | Module                    | Purpose                                     | Output                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **VDOM/Vapor** | `template/code_gen/vdom/` | Runtime render functions for bundler output | `_createElementVNode(...)` calls |
| **IDE**        | `ide/template/`           | Valid JSX/TSX for LSP/TSGO type checking    | `<div prop={expr}>` JSX elements |

The **LSP uses the IDE path** via `host.ensure_compiled()` with `CompileTarget::IDE`. TSGO type-checks this output. Changes to VDOM codegen do NOT affect LSP hover/completions. The IDE codegen auto-detects the script language: TS SFCs produce `.tsx` (TypeScript + JSX), while JS SFCs (no `lang` or `lang="js"`) produce `.jsx` (JavaScript + JSDoc annotations).

### Strict Slot Children Type Checking (Experimental)

When `strict_slots: true` (VS Code: `verter.experimental.strictSlots`), the IDE template codegen emits `strictRenderSlot` calls after the JSX tree. These enforce that slot children match the parent component's `defineSlots()` type signature ([RFC #733](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/discussions/733)).

**Generated pattern** (inside the block scope, after JSX):

```tsx
___VERTER___strictRenderSlot({} as NonNullable<ReturnType<typeof ___VERTER___Comp{offset}>['$slots']['{slot}']>, [TabItem, {} as HTMLElementTagNameMap["input"], "" as string]);
```

**Child type references**: Component → constructor name, HTML element → `HTMLElementTagNameMap["tag"]`, text/interpolation → `"" as string`. Each child is a sourcemapped `InsertedMapped` chunk pointing to its template position.

**Skipped cases**: self-closing components (no children), `is_jsx` mode, `<component :is>` (deferred), whitespace-only text, comments.

**Key files**: `ide/template/mod.rs` (`StrictSlotEntry`, `collect_strict_slot_children`, `emit_strict_slot_checks`), `ide/script.rs` (ambient `strictRenderSlot` type declarations).

### Fallthrough / Root Inheritance (CRITICAL)

The shared Rust pipeline owns all fallthrough and root inheritance semantics. `verter_analysis` extracts root reachability facts only. `verter_host` owns the single inheritance resolver, recursion, conditional branch composition, generic propagation, caching, and final metadata projection.

**Public contract** (on `ComponentMetaAnalysis` / `FfiComponentMeta` / `ComponentMeta`):

- `props` / `events` — declared component surface only (unchanged)
- `acceptedProps` / `acceptedEvents` — computed call-site acceptance surface (declared + inherited)
- `acceptedSurfaceCompleteness` — `Exact` or `LowerBound` (if any branch is partial/unresolved)
- `rootReachability` — structural root classification before inheritance resolution
- `fallthroughSurface` — branch-structured inherited surface after host resolution

**Semantic rules**:

- `inheritAttrs: false` → no inherited surface
- Unconditional multi-root (fragment) → no inherited surface
- Root `v-for` → no inherited surface
- Single native root → intrinsic attrs/listeners minus declared props/events minus consumed root bindings
- Single component root → recursive propagation through the child's full public surface
- Conditional single-root branches → exact union of branch surfaces
- Cycles → terminate safely as unresolved branches, no invented members
- Unsupported roots (`<component :is>`, `<slot>`, Vue built-ins) → unresolved branches
- `class` and `style` are never consumed (Vue always merges them)
- `@click` and `:onClick` normalize to the same canonical listener name (`click`)
- Declared props/events always take precedence over inherited names

**Authority chain**: analysis extracts `RootReachability` → host resolves `FallthroughResolution` → `get_component_meta()` populates `accepted_*` and `fallthrough_surface` → FFI maps to JSON → TS consumes.

**Compat**: mapping-only. Flat Volar `props/events` stay on declared surfaces. Branch-structured inherited data is on `_verter`.

**Key files**: `verter_analysis/src/component_meta.rs` (types + root extraction), `verter_analysis/src/html_intrinsics.rs` (native intrinsic catalog), `verter_host/src/host_manage.rs` (resolver + cache), `verter_ffi/src/types.rs` + `convert.rs` (FFI), `packages/component-meta/src/types.ts` (TS types).

### Component-Meta Native Vs Compat (CRITICAL)

The official/native component-meta payload is the semantic authority. `@verter/component-meta/compat` is a projection layer for `vue-component-meta` interoperability, not a second semantic pipeline.

- Fix missing or incorrect metadata in the shared/native owner layer first. Compat should only remap representation when the native payload is already correct enough.
- Do not weaken native TypeScript meaning to imitate Volar formatting. Example: keep native `boolean` as `boolean`; any `true | false` expansion belongs only in compat-specific display/schema logic if we choose to support it.
- Indexed-access members may be resolved/expanded when that improves real type fidelity. Targeted compat expansion such as `Alert['variants']['color']` → the concrete color union is acceptable; blanket ref flattening is not.
- Compat `exposed` parity should be derived from a shared cached public-instance surface (for example a `ComponentPublicInstance` extraction owned by the host/public-instance path). Do not redefine native `exposed` to mean public-instance unless the public API is deliberately expanded.
- Native-only extensions such as `models`, `acceptedProps`, `acceptedEvents`, `acceptedSurfaceCompleteness`, `rootReachability`, and `fallthroughSurface` are part of Verter's official API. Benchmark them separately from Volar-surface parity instead of treating them as regressions.
- Component-meta type recovery must stay cache-owned. When changing `verter_host`, `verter_resolver`, or `packages/component-meta` type paths, rely on cached lookup/eval state and expand only on demand; do not rewalk AST/source as a fallback to recover missing types.
- Component-meta registry publication must stay shallow. Publish only the symbols demanded by the current query path, and do not eagerly materialize unrelated owner/package helpers just to populate the registry.
- Component-meta companion/file-target selection must stay shallow too. Choosing between runtime and declaration companions may probe cached raw source existence, but must not build export analysis, snapshots, or eval envs just to decide the target file.
- Imported component-meta hydration must stay cache-owned too. Once shallow imported dependency state exists, later alias/registry/fallthrough resolver stages must read only from that cache-owned state and must not jump back to raw snapshot/source builders for imported files.
- Component-meta resolvers must deepen in exactly one place per requested symbol/query path. Do not let a file-level helper widen into sibling symbols/files that are not on the active declaration route.
- Component-meta metadata/fallthrough projection must stay query-scoped. Reuse the resolved state plus captured `HostStoreView`/session view; do not re-enter a fresh top-level meta/fallthrough query when a resolved query already exists.
- Imported-eval collection for component-meta must stay single-path and lazy. Do not introduce eager collection modes or reparsing fallbacks from stored source text; selected imported symbols must be hydrated through the host-owned cache only.

### CodeTransform Is the Single Source of Truth (CRITICAL)

**All modifications to generated code MUST go through `CodeTransform` operations** (`overwrite`, `prepend_left`, `append_left`, `move_with_suffix`, etc.). Never apply string replacements, regex transforms, or manual splicing to the output of `build_string()` or to content that was produced by a `CodeTransform`.

Post-hoc string manipulation breaks sourcemap accuracy: the `CodeTransform` generates source maps by tracking chunks (Original, Inserted, Moved, Overwritten). If you modify the string after the transform, byte offsets in the source map no longer match the actual content. This causes position mismatches in the LSP (e.g., hover landing on the wrong token, go-to-definition jumping to wrong locations).

**Correct:** Use `ct.prepend_left(pos, ".ts")` to insert text at a known position — the chunk list and source map stay consistent.

**Wrong:** Call `content.replace(".vue'", ".vue.ts'")` on the built string — the source map still reflects the pre-replace byte offsets.

### Type Evaluator Sharing & Depth Limits

`verter_analysis::type_eval` is the shared lightweight type evaluator used by analysis, host, and resolver surfaces. Its memory and caching invariants matter across the workspace.

- Recursive `TypeExpr` structure is Arc-backed (`Arc<TypeExpr>`, `Arc<[TypeExpr]>`, `Arc<ObjectExpr>`, `Arc<FunctionExpr>`) so clones stay shallow.
- `EvalEnv.type_bindings` stores `Arc<TypeExpr>`, not owned `TypeExpr`, so generic instantiation does not re-copy bound subtrees.
- `resolved_refs` caches `Arc<TypeExpr>` values keyed by stable declaration identity plus interned type arguments. Cache-hit callers may clone the outer `TypeExpr`, but child allocations must stay shared.
- `max_ref_depth` is a safety valve for nested `evaluate_ref` chains only. When the limit is hit, return a symbolic `TypeExpr::Ref` built from the already-interned evaluated args. Do not cache that fallback result.
- Structural-sharing regressions should be covered in dedicated evaluator tests and the Criterion pathological-graph bench in `crates/verter_analysis/benches/type_eval_bench.rs`.

### IDE Script Error Recovery

When OXC encounters parse errors during typing (e.g., `count.` mid-expression), the IDE script codegen (`ide/script.rs`) uses a **truncate-and-reparse** strategy instead of falling back to degraded file-scope output:

1. Find the earliest error offset from OXC diagnostics.
2. Truncate source at the last newline before that offset — the "clean prefix".
3. Re-parse only the clean prefix (which succeeds since the broken code is removed).
4. Use the clean prefix AST for normal codegen (import hoisting, binding extraction, macro processing). The broken tail passes through unchanged in the CodeTransform.

A lightweight token scanner (`ide/script_recover.rs`) recovers macro binding names from the broken tail so template bindings still resolve. This means typing `count.` at the end of a script preserves hover, completions, and go-to-definition for all declarations above the cursor.

**Fallback**: When the clean prefix is empty (error on first line) or the clean prefix itself fails to parse, the system falls back to file-scope error recovery mode (`process_tsx_script_setup_error_mode`).

### TypeProvider Architecture

The LSP delegates TypeScript type checking to an external **TypeProvider** process. Two backends are supported:

| Backend      | Binary             | Protocol                                   | Use Case                             |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **TSGO**     | `tsgo` (Go binary) | LSP over stdio (Content-Length + JSON-RPC) | Fast, native TS checking (preview)   |
| **tsserver** | `node tsserver.js` | Newline-delimited JSON over stdio          | Workspace TS version, plugin support |

**Provider selection** (`--type-provider` CLI arg / `verter.typeProvider` VS Code setting):

- `auto` (default): if TS 5.x/6.x installed, uses tsserver; otherwise tries TSGO
- `tsgo`: TSGO only
- `tsserver`: tsserver only
- `off`: no type provider (verter-only mode)

Only one provider runs at a time. Both use the `TypeProvider` trait (`tsgo/traits.rs`) with 14+ methods (hover, completions, diagnostics, definition, references, rename, etc.). Both are wrapped in a `ResilientTypeProvider` that detects crashes, auto-restarts (max 3 with exponential backoff), and replays the file cache.

**tsserver kind mapping**: `parse_tsserver_completion()` in `tsserver/ipc.rs` maps tsserver's `ScriptElementKind` strings to LSP `CompletionItemKind`. This mapping MUST match VS Code's `MyCompletionItem.convertKind()` exactly. Test coverage: `test_parse_tsserver_completion_kinds_match_vscode`. Sync with VS Code source when updating TypeScript dependencies.

**Key modules** (`crates/verter_lsp/src/`):

- `tsgo/` — TSGO integration (LSP client, resilient wrapper, project sync)
- `tsserver/mod.rs` — `find_tsserver()`, `find_node()`, `detect_ts_major_version()`
- `tsserver/ipc.rs` — `TsserverTypeProvider`, newline-delimited JSON transport, position conversion
- `tsserver/resilient.rs` — `ResilientTsserverProvider` (crash detection + auto-restart)
- `workspace_scanner.rs` — Async background workspace scanner with priority-based file loading

**Background file sync**: During `initialized()`, the LSP spawns a `WorkspaceScanner` background task that compiles ALL workspace `.vue` files to TSX and syncs them to the type provider asynchronously. For TSGO, both `.vue.tsx` (IDE artifact) and `.vue.ts` (public API) are synced; cross-file imports resolve through `.vue.ts` (via `rewrite_vue_imports_for_tsgo`). This ensures imports of non-open `.vue` files resolve to actual component types rather than the wildcard `declare module '*.vue'` fallback.

**Barrel-import eager sync** (TSGO): When a Vue file imports components through a barrel (non-Vue re-export file like `components/index.ts`), the LSP eagerly syncs the barrel and its Vue dependencies to TSGO during `did_open` and `resync_aliased_imports_for_open_files`. The process: (1) discover barrels from `TemplateComponentUsage.import_source` resolving to non-Vue files, (2) scan barrel's `module_references` for `.vue` specifiers, (3) sync Vue dependencies first, (4) sync barrel file. Without this, TSGO only receives barrels from the background scanner, which may not complete before hover/completion requests.

**Freeze prevention** (fast typing): Three layers prevent tokio runtime starvation during rapid typing:

1. **SyncCoordinator** (`sync_coordinator.rs`): Single long-lived task replaces spawn-per-keystroke debounce. Uses mpsc channel + 300ms deadline map to guarantee exactly one sync per file after typing stops. After syncing, computes and publishes merged (Verter lint + TS type) diagnostics via push. Holds shared `Arc<VerterHost>`, `ProjectSync`, `TypeProvider`, `cached_verter_diags`, and `PositionEncodingKind`.
2. **Push diagnostics only**: The LSP uses push diagnostics exclusively (no pull/`diagnostic_provider`). During typing, no new diagnostics are published — VS Code automatically adjusts existing push diagnostic positions as the document changes. The SyncCoordinator publishes fresh merged diagnostics after 300ms of silence.
3. **Hang detection** (`tsgo/ipc.rs`): `LspTransport` tracks `consecutive_failures` (AtomicU32). After 3 consecutive request timeouts, fires `crash_notify` to trigger `ResilientTypeProvider`'s existing restart machinery. Notifications use `try_send()` (non-blocking) to prevent channel backpressure.

**Heartbeat watchdog**: The server sends `$/verter/heartbeat` every 5s from `initialized()`. The VS Code extension monitors heartbeats — if none arrive for 30s, it auto-restarts the server. This is the last-resort safety net for runtime starvation.

**Async workspace scanning**: During `initialized()`, the LSP spawns a `WorkspaceScanner` background task instead of scanning synchronously. The scanner walks the filesystem, compiles `.vue` files to TSX, and syncs them to the type provider in priority order:

1. **Tier 0**: Files opened in the editor (signaled by `did_open`)
2. **Tier 1**: Project source files covered by `tsconfig.json` — siblings of open files first, then expanding outward
3. **Tier 2**: Remaining `.vue` files not covered by any tsconfig

TSGO sync is throttled (yield every 10 files) to prevent flooding. The scanner receives priority signals from `did_open` to dynamically re-order its queue. This makes `initialized()` return in <1s instead of blocking for the full scan duration.

**Key module**: `crates/verter_lsp/src/workspace_scanner.rs` — `WorkspaceScannerHandle`, `spawn_workspace_scanner()`, priority sorting, throttled sync loop.

### Ownership Lifecycle & Bootstrap Sync

The VFS publishes workspace snapshots atomically via `PublishedRoot`. Each snapshot carries an `ownership_ready: bool` flag:

- **Bootstrap** (`ownership_ready: false`): `Engine::new()` eagerly publishes an empty snapshot so basic relative resolution works immediately. Ownership queries return no results. Provider path transforms (`provider_id_for_source`, `provider_ide_id_for_source`) are pure — they work without ownership.
- **Ready** (`ownership_ready: true`): After `background_init` builds the full project graph, a real snapshot is published. Ownership queries are now authoritative.

**Provider sync state uses typed ownership** (`ProviderOwnerBinding`):

- `Provisional` — file synced before ownership is known (bootstrap).
- `Owned(String)` — file bound to a real project (tsconfig path or root).

**Readiness-gated sync rules**:

- `ensure_current_file_synced()`: During bootstrap, provisional sync is allowed. With a ready snapshot, only files with a project owner are synced — unowned files are queued in `pending_snapshot_provider_sync` for later drain.
- `sync_imported_vue_api_lightweight()`: Same rule — provisional sync only during bootstrap.
- `SyncCoordinator::sync_file()`: Always queues files with no owner for retry. Uses `ownership_ready` for log level (warn vs info).

**Key files**: `crates/verter_vfs/src/published_state.rs` (`PublishedRoot`, `ownership_ready`), `crates/verter_lsp/src/provider_sync.rs` (`ProviderOwnerBinding`, `ProviderSyncState`), `crates/verter_lsp/src/server.rs` (`PublishedResolverSnapshot`, `ensure_current_file_synced`).

### Multi-Root Workspace & Per-Project Configuration

In monorepo / multi-root VS Code workspaces, different packages have different `tsconfig.json` paths aliases, `.verterrc.json` lint rules, and `vite.config` resolve aliases. The LSP stores all workspace folders (`workspace_roots: Mutex<Vec<String>>`) and builds a `ProjectRegistry` that groups per-project configuration.

**Key types** (`crates/verter_lsp/src/config.rs`):

- `ProjectConfig` — per-project: root path, `ResolvedLintConfig`, `Linter` instance, optional `vite_config_path` and `vite_config_deps`
- `ProjectRegistry` — sorted by root length (longest prefix first), provides `find_project()`, `find_project_root()`, `linter_for()`
- `RegistryBuildResult` — returned from `from_workspace_roots()`, contains `registry` + `trust_required` list

**Import resolution** (single VFS authority): All LSP import resolution goes through `WorkspaceAccess::resolve_import()` via the VFS `FilesystemWorkspace`. The workspace is created in `initialize()` with an empty project graph (enabling relative/node_modules resolution immediately), then `background_init` populates the full project graph via `set_project_graph()` for alias resolution. The host's internal `project_resolver` (set via `set_internal_resolver()`) is used only for compilation — never for LSP resolution. `preferred_specifier()` provides reverse-alias lookup for auto-imports.

**Tsconfig/vite config discovery** delegates to `verter_vfs::config` — all tsconfig parsing, membership, references, and `raw_paths_json` live in VFS. Fallback projects (no tsconfig) get Vite aliases via two-tier analysis in `vite_config.rs`:

1. **Static analysis** (OXC): Parses `vite.config.{ts,js,mjs,cjs,mts,cts}` without executing code. Handles object/array alias forms, `defineConfig()`, template literals, `path.resolve()`, `new URL()`, `fileURLToPath()`. Returns `Complex` for configs using env vars, dynamic imports, or non-allowlisted packages.
2. **Trusted execution** (opt-in): For complex configs, spawns Node.js with `loadConfigFromFile` if the file is in `verter.viteConfig.trustedFiles`. Includes env sanitization, 10s timeout, and last-known-good caching.

The server sends `$/verter/viteConfigTrustRequired` notifications for complex configs not yet trusted, and the extension shows a trust prompt. Config file changes (detected via file watcher) trigger a full registry rebuild.

**Type provider integration**: TSGO receives `workspace/didChangeWorkspaceFolders` notifications. tsserver uses per-file `projectRootPath` from the project registry. Both resilient wrappers store workspace folders for restart replay.

**Lock ordering** (prevents deadlocks): `workspace_roots` (async) → `project_registry` (sync read) → release → `fallback_linter` (sync read). Never acquire `fallback_linter` while holding `project_registry`.

### Style Preprocessing in Bundler Mode

Style blocks with `lang="scss"`, `lang="sass"`, or `lang="less"` require preprocessing to CSS. The pipeline differs between Vite and non-Vite bundlers:

**Vite mode** (Vite-owned preprocessing, matching `@vitejs/plugin-vue`):

1. During main `.vue` `transform()`, the plugin parses the SFC with `compiler.parse()` and caches raw style block content in `styleBlockCache`. Style preprocessing is **skipped** in `applyPreprocessorRequests()`.
2. `load()` returns raw style source (e.g., SCSS with `$variables`) from `styleBlockCache`.
3. Style URLs preserve the original lang (`lang.scss`, not `lang.css`) since `meta.style_langs` is never overwritten.
4. Vite's CSS pipeline preprocesses SCSS/SASS/Less/Stylus automatically between `load()` and `transform()`.
5. `transform()` always runs `compiler.compileStyleAsync()` for Vue-specific post-processing: scoped CSS attribute selectors (`[data-v-...]`) and CSS `v-bind()` rewriting. This runs even for unscoped plain CSS blocks (CSS `v-bind()` still needs rewriting).

**Non-Vite mode** (preprocessor fallback):
Style preprocessing goes through `preprocessBlock()` → `preprocessStyle()` which calls Vite's `preprocessCSS()` in-process (if Vite config is available). The compiled CSS is sent to the Rust host via `applyBlockOverrides()`, and `apply_style_overrides()` updates `meta.style_langs` to `"css"`. The `transform()` hook uses Rust `processStyle()` for CSS scoping only.

**Compiler resolution**: `vue/compiler-sfc` is resolved once per plugin instance from the project root in `configResolved()` via `createRequire(join(root, "package.json"))("vue/compiler-sfc")`. This is stored in the `compiler` variable and used for both SFC parsing (`compiler.parse()`) and style post-processing (`compiler.compileStyleAsync()`).

**Key files**: `packages/unplugin/src/index.ts` (`styleBlockCache`, `compileStyleAsync` in transform, style load from cache), `packages/unplugin/src/core/preprocessor.ts` (non-Vite style preprocessing via `preprocessStyle()`), `crates/verter_host/src/host_upsert.rs` (`apply_style_overrides` — lang update, non-Vite only), `crates/verter_host/src/id.rs` (`render_ids` — URL generation).

### Cached Directive Fields on ElementNode

The parser extracts structural directives from `el.props` via `prop.take()` and caches them as dedicated fields on `ElementNode` (`ast/types.rs`):

| Field         | Directive                     | In `el.props`? | Notes                                            |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `v_condition` | `v-if`, `v-else-if`, `v-else` | **No** (taken) | Contains `ElementNodeCondition` with kind + prop |
| `v_for`       | `v-for`                       | **No** (taken) | Contains the full `NodeProp`                     |
| `v_slot`      | `v-slot`, `#name`             | **No** (taken) | Contains the full `NodeProp`                     |
| `v_once`      | `v-once`                      | **No** (taken) | Contains the full `NodeProp`                     |
| `v_ref`       | `ref`, `:ref`                 | **No** (taken) | Contains the full `NodeProp`                     |

**Consequence**: Code iterating `el.props` will **never see** these directives. Both codegen paths must handle them explicitly. The IDE module removes `v-if/v-for/v-slot/v-once` attributes (they become JSX wrappers/removals) and converts `ref` to JSX expression syntax (`ref={"name"}`).

### Position Encoding (CRITICAL rules)

See `/position-encoding` skill for full span type reference, encoding tables, and path normalization details.

**Encoding source of truth**: The position encoding MUST come from the client capabilities negotiated during `initialize()`. The server stores it in `Arc<parking_lot::RwLock<PositionEncodingKind>>` shared with the SyncCoordinator. Default is UTF-16 (per LSP spec) until negotiated. **Rust-internal code uses UTF-8 byte offsets**; **LSP boundary code converts to negotiated encoding**; **JS/VS Code uses UTF-16**.

**Line/Column Base Rules** (off-by-one bugs):

- **PositionResolver is 1-based** — subtract 1 for source maps and LSP
- **Source maps, LSP, VS Code are all 0-based**
- **OXC/verter spans are byte offsets** — no line/column conversion needed

**Serialization rule**: All data crossing serde/MCP/LSP/FFI boundaries MUST use `Span` (SFC-absolute). `RelativeSpan`/`PartialGeneratedSpan`/`GeneratedSpan` do not implement Serialize.

### Path Normalization (CRITICAL rules)

See `/position-encoding` skill for canonical ID format and boundary tables.

1. **Receive → normalize immediately** (`canonicalize_id()` or `uri_to_canonical_id_from_str()`)
2. **Store only canonical IDs** in all maps and caches
3. **Denormalize at exit boundaries** (file:// URIs or OS paths)
4. **Never compare raw paths** — always compare canonical IDs

## Build

```bash
pnpm install                  # Install all dependencies
pnpm build                    # Build everything: native → lsp → wasm → ts packages
pnpm run build:native         # Build native .node bindings only
pnpm run build:lsp            # Build Rust LSP binary (debug)
pnpm run build:lsp:release    # Build Rust LSP binary (release, optimized)
pnpm run build:mcp            # Build MCP server binary (debug)
pnpm run build:mcp:release    # Build MCP server binary (release, optimized)
pnpm run build:wasm           # Build WASM + copy to playground
pnpm run build:ts             # Build all TypeScript packages
pnpm run build:playground     # Build the playground for deployment
```

`pnpm build` runs sequentially: native bindings first (needed by unplugin), then LSP binary (shares compiled Rust deps with native, avoids recompilation), then WASM (needed by playground), then all TS packages.

See `/build-and-profiling` skill for build dependency chains, rebuild sequences, and profiling setup.

## Development

```bash
pnpm watch                    # Watch-build TS packages for extension dev
pnpm dev-extension            # Build LSP binary, then watch language-shared + vscode extension + typescript-plugin
pnpm clean                    # Remove build artifacts
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# TypeScript / JavaScript
pnpm test                                    # All JS/TS tests
pnpm vitest --run                            # All tests (non-watch)
pnpm vitest --run path/to/test.spec.ts       # Specific file

# Rust
cargo test --workspace --verbose             # All Rust tests
cargo test --package verter_core test_name   # Specific Rust test
cargo test --package verter_core 2>&1 | tail -60  # Full suite with truncated output
```

### End-of-change Checks

Run these after making changes:

```bash
cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty --allow-staged --workspace -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile   # Verify lockfile is in sync (CI uses this)
```

### Documentation Updates

After adding, changing, or removing features, check and update relevant documentation:

- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Architecture tables, module paths, key file references
- **`docs/`** — API docs, guide pages, contributing guides (`docs/contributing/rust-setup.md`, etc.)
- **`.claude/skills/`** — Skill files referencing affected modules or APIs
- **Inline doc comments** — Public API rustdoc (`///`) and JSDoc (`/** */`) on changed signatures

Skip this for purely internal refactors that don't change any public behavior, module paths, or APIs.

### Testing Requirements

**MANDATORY RULE — TDD (Test-Driven Development) must be followed for EVERY code change. This is non-negotiable. All agents, subagents, and automated workflows MUST comply. Skipping TDD is never acceptable, regardless of task size or urgency.**

**TDD workflow (strict order — no exceptions):**

1. **Write failing tests FIRST** — before writing ANY implementation code, write one or more tests that demonstrate the expected behavior. Run the tests and **verify they fail**. Do not proceed to step 2 until you have confirmed test failure.
2. **Implement the minimum code** to make the failing tests pass. Do not write implementation code before tests exist.
3. **Run the tests again** and verify they pass.
4. **Refactor** if needed while keeping tests green.

**Violation examples (DO NOT do these):**

- Writing implementation code and then adding tests after the fact
- Writing tests and implementation simultaneously without verifying the tests fail first
- Skipping tests for "small" or "trivial" changes
- Delegating implementation to a subagent without requiring TDD compliance

Coverage expectations:

- New features: Add tests covering the new functionality
- Bug fixes: Add tests that would have caught the bug
- Refactoring: Ensure existing tests pass and add tests for edge cases discovered
- Behavioral changes: Add tests verifying the new behavior

Tests serve as documentation of expected behavior and prevent regressions.

**IMPORTANT — Always include negative assertions**:

Every test must verify both what SHOULD be present AND what should NOT be present. A test that only checks for expected output can pass even when the output contains invalid/broken content alongside the expected content.

```rust
// GOOD: Both positive and negative assertions
let result = gen_tsx_template(r#"<template><div v-if="show">hello</div></template>"#);
assert!(result.contains("if(show)"), "should have IIFE if-block condition");  // positive
assert!(!result.contains("v-if"), "v-if attribute must be removed from JSX"); // negative

// BAD: Only positive assertion — passes even if v-if="show" leaks into output
let result = gen_tsx_template(r#"<template><div v-if="show">hello</div></template>"#);
assert!(result.contains("if(show)"), "should have IIFE if-block condition"); // not enough!
```

For codegen tests: always verify that removed/transformed Vue syntax does NOT appear in output. For type tests: always include both positive assertions and `@ts-expect-error` negative assertions to guard against `any`/`never`.

**IMPORTANT — Rust test file organization**:

When a Rust source file's inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block exceeds ~400 lines, extract tests to a sibling `*_tests.rs` file:

```rust
// In foo.rs — replace the inline mod tests block with:
#[cfg(test)]
#[path = "foo_tests.rs"]
mod foo_tests;
```

For `mod.rs` files, use the simpler form (loads `tests.rs` from the same directory):

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests;
```

The extracted file contains the module contents directly (no wrapping `mod tests { }`), starting with `use super::*;`.

See `/testing` skill for full TS/Rust test patterns, sourcemap testing, E2E best practices, and server cleanup.

### VS Code Extension Testing (MANDATORY)

Changes to the VS Code extension (`packages/vue-vscode/`) or the LSP server (`crates/verter_lsp/`) MUST be verified with automated tests, NOT manual testing. LSP changes directly affect extension behavior — hover, completions, diagnostics, etc. Two test tiers exist:

**Unit tests** (Vitest, `*.spec.ts` co-located in `src/`):

- For pure logic: utility functions, response parsing, restart logic, CSS scanning
- Run: `pnpm vitest --run packages/vue-vscode/src/path/to/file.spec.ts`

**E2E tests** (Mocha + @vscode/test-cli, `e2e/suite/*.test.ts`):

- For LSP integration: completions, hover, diagnostics, go-to-definition, rename, decorations
- Single fixture/provider: `E2E_FIXTURE=single-project E2E_TYPE_PROVIDER=tsserver pnpm --filter verter-vscode test:e2e`
- Full matrix from the repo root: `pnpm run test:e2e`
- CI runs the same fixture matrix across both `tsserver` and `tsgo`
- See `.claude/skills/e2e-vscode-testing.md` for fixture design, helpers API, and adding new tests

**When to use which:**

- New extension utility/parser logic → unit test
- New/changed LSP feature (hover, completion, diagnostics, definition, rename, decorations) → E2E test
- `verter_lsp` changes (new handler, changed response format, sync behavior) → E2E test
- Both if the change spans utility logic + LSP behavior

**Never acceptable:** "Test manually by opening VS Code" as the sole verification step in a plan.

### Agent Feedback Capture

During work sessions, agents encounter issues, discover improvement opportunities, and gain insights that may be lost when context is compacted. To preserve these observations, agents MUST continuously log feedback to a per-conversation file.

**Setup** (at session start, when making code changes):

- Create a feedback file at `.claude/feedback/feedback-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{short-id}.md` where `short-id` is a 6-character identifier (e.g., from the plan name or timestamp)
- The `.claude/feedback/` directory is gitignored — these files are for human review only

**What to log** — append entries whenever encountering something noteworthy:

- `[issue]` — bugs, unexpected behavior, workarounds applied
- `[improvement]` — code quality, performance, architecture ideas
- `[debt]` — things that work but could be better
- `[docs]` — missing or outdated documentation discovered

**Format**:

```markdown
## {date}

- [{category}] `{file_path}:{line}` — Brief description of the observation
- [{category}] `{file_path}` — Another observation
```

**Rules**:

- Append continuously as you work — do not wait for context compaction
- When delegating to subagents, pass the feedback file path in the prompt and instruct them to append their observations
- This is best-effort — do not let feedback capture slow down actual work
- One feedback file per conversation session

## Dependencies Policy

- Keep dependencies at their latest versions
- Rust deps: update in `Cargo.toml`, run `cargo update`
- JS deps: `pnpm up -r -i -L` to interactively update all
- `workspace:^` deps are rewritten by `pnpm publish` automatically
