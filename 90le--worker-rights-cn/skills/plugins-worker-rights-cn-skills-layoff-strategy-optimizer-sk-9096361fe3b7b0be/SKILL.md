description: Build lawful worker-side strategies for enterprise layoffs, dismissals, forced resignations, low settlement offers, protected-status layoffs, high-wage cap disputes, unpaid wage or social-insurance leverage, unsigned contracts, non-compete pressure, and arbitration/negotiation sequencing. Use when Codex needs to help a worker identify the strongest legal claim stack, evidence plan, negotiation posture, and filing path for maximizing lawful recovery without fabricating facts, threats, or unsafe tactics. Use when this capability is needed.

# Layoff Strategy Optimizer

## Overview

Create a lawful, worker-side strategy that prioritizes the highest supported recovery path under the evidence. This skill coordinates `case-intake`, `safety-guardrails`, `layoff-defense`, `compensation-calculator`, `local-rules-adapter`, `evidence-builder`, `negotiation-coach`, `agreement-review`, and `arbitration-drafter`.

## Workflow

1. Screen unsafe requests with `safety-guardrails`; refuse fabrication, threats, illegal data access, or outcome guarantees.
2. Use `case-intake` facts to classify the scenario. If multiple labels conflict, use `unclear_or_mixed` until documents and chronology are reconciled.
3. Read `references/strategy-matrix.json` and match the strongest scenario IDs.
4. Use `layoff-defense` to bind termination maps and legal anchors.
5. Use `compensation-calculator` for `N`, `N+1`, `2N`, unpaid wages, annual leave, and double-wage estimates when inputs are available.
6. Use `local-rules-adapter` for city cap, social-insurance, housing-fund, and local filing checks; mark uncertain local figures as `local_verify`.
7. Use `evidence-builder` to rank immediate evidence and employer-controlled proof requests.
8. Use `negotiation-coach` before signing or when leverage can produce a better settlement.
9. Use `agreement-review` before any resignation, waiver, settlement, non-compete, payment schedule, or all-claims clause is signed.
10. Use `arbitration-drafter` when negotiation fails, limitation is near, or the employer refuses written terms/payment.

## Strategy Rules

- Optimize for lawful expected value, not only the largest theoretical number.
- Present `best_supported_path`, `fallback_path`, and `settlement_floor`; do not overstate weak claims as guaranteed.
- Preserve the worker's strongest characterization: avoid personal-reason resignation, broad waiver, vague settlement, or unsupported admission before review.
- Compare `N`, `N+1`, `2N`, reinstatement, unpaid wages, annual leave, double wage, non-compete compensation, and local cap issues separately.
- Use protected status, procedure gaps, wage arrears, unsigned contract, employer-controlled evidence, and settlement payment certainty as negotiation levers only when facts support them.
- Never advise threats, public shaming, fake evidence, hidden recordings where illegal, company data copying, or personal-information exposure.

## Output Format

Return:

- `scenario_matches`: matched scenario IDs and confidence labels.
- `best_supported_path`: claims and negotiation ask supported by current facts.
- `fallback_path`: safer claim stack if disputed facts fail.
- `settlement_floor`: evidence-based minimum to demand before signing, with caveats.
- `upside_items`: claims or levers that may increase recovery after more evidence.
- `evidence_sprint`: what to preserve within 24 hours, what to request, and what is employer-controlled.
- `message_strategy`: negotiation scenario, safe message goals, and forbidden phrases.
- `filing_strategy`: arbitration claims, limitation warnings, respondent/jurisdiction checks, and local form checks.
- `local_verify`: city-specific cap, social-insurance, housing-fund, and local practice gaps.
- `risk_flags`: safety, signed waiver, limitation, protected status, high-wage cap, non-compete, or weak-evidence risks.
- `source_anchors`: national legal anchors plus local source IDs where relevant.

## Resources

Read `references/strategy-matrix.json` before building a strategy.

Use `scripts/run_strategy_cases.py` to validate strategy scenarios, referenced evidence IDs, negotiation scenarios, arbitration claim types, safety categories, legal anchors, local source IDs, and regression cases.
