# Task Environment

This environment contains a prebuilt **SkillDAG** typed-skill graph workspace.

## Required First Step

Before writing any code, retrieve relevant skills in two steps:

```bash
skilldag graph search "goal + artifact/format + operation/API + verifier-critical constraint" --top-k 5
skilldag show <skill_id>
```

`skilldag graph search` returns a ranked list of skill ids with scores and one-line descriptions. `skilldag show <id>` prints the full SKILL.md body. Pass multiple ids — `skilldag show A B C` — to read several skills in one call. Both commands are on PATH inside the container.

When writing the query, include only the retrieval-critical task facts that are actually known:

- concrete goal
- artifact, file format, or main object
- key operation, algorithm, API, or library
- verifier-critical constraint or invariant

Examples:

```text
update embedded xlsx in pptx preserve formulas
parallel tfidf search processpoolexecutor deterministic ranking
exact civ6 district adjacency calculator
```

Avoid vague queries such as `solve this task` or `help with benchmark`.

Retrieval is free and interruptible. Use `skilldag show <id>` for each skill that looks relevant, and consult more skills later if the task surface changes. If the ranking is empty, explicitly note that no relevant skill was found and continue without claiming skill usage. Otherwise, use the retrieved skills only as constraints on how to solve the task.

## Failure Reflection

SkillDAG failure-reflection protocol:

1. When an action or command fails, infer the missing precondition or wrong assumption before doing anything else.
2. Ask whether the failure is reusable across tasks:
   - Reusable structural error between two skills → mutate the graph.
   - One-off world-state confusion or local mistake → do not mutate; inspect state or try a different action/command.
3. Repeating the same failed action or near-identical search query is not progress.
4. Retrieval is free and interruptible: `skilldag show` / `search` / `get-*` calls do NOT consume your env-action budget, so you may consult skills at any point during the task — including mid-execution after an unexpected observation.
5. Mutation reasons must cite concrete evidence from THIS task in ≤30 words.

## When to Mutate

- `depends_on`: skill A keeps failing until skill B's setup/output should happen first.
- `composes_with`: A and B should be chained, but the current graph does not expose that composition.
- `conflicts_with`: two skills suggest incompatible or redundant procedures and jointly mislead execution.
- `edit-edge remove` / `edit-edge retype`: an existing relation is clearly contradicted by repeated failure evidence. Prefer `retype` over adding a second contradictory edge on the same pair.

CRITICAL — `depends_on` direction:

- `edit-edge add A B depends_on` = A requires B first. Source = A (dependent / failing skill); Target = B (prerequisite).
- Chronology may be B → A, but edge is A → B.
- If evidence says "A failed because B was missing", write `add A B depends_on`.
- Pre-commit check: read "A requires B first"; if backward, swap A/B.

## Online Graph Edit

Mutation is a two-step flow — propose (dry-run) first, commit second.

**Step 1 — propose.** Returns `{would, related}`; never mutates. `related` lists every existing edge and recent history entry whose endpoints match the target pair (ignoring direction), each with its reason so you can read prior evidence before acting. `--reason` is required as a forcing function: state the evidence in ≤30 words BEFORE you see `related`. The same string can be reused at commit.

```bash
skilldag graph propose-edge    <src> <tgt> <type>                --reason "<evidence>"
skilldag graph propose-remove  <src> <tgt> <type>                --reason "<evidence>"
skilldag graph propose-retype  <src> <tgt> --from <t1> --to <t2> --reason "<evidence>"
```

**Step 2 — commit.** Only path that writes. `--reason` is required.

```bash
skilldag graph edit-edge add    <src> <tgt> <type>                   --reason "<evidence>"
skilldag graph edit-edge remove <src> <tgt> <type>                   --reason "<evidence>"
skilldag graph edit-edge retype <src> <tgt> --from <t1> --to <t2>    --reason "<evidence>"
```

Edge types: `depends_on | composes_with | similar_to | conflicts_with | specializes`.

Rules:

- Propose whenever you have thought about it and the relation looks reasonable. `propose-*` is a pure dry-run — it never writes, so the bar is your own judgement, not a quota of failures.
- `--reason` is required on propose. State the evidence (≤30 words) BEFORE you see `related`; this forces you to articulate the case rather than rationalize after the fact.
- After propose, read the `related` list. If a prior edge or history entry on the same pair exists, its reason tells you whether your new evidence is consistent, contradictory, or redundant.
- If your new evidence contradicts a prior edge's reason, use `edit-edge retype` (or `edit-edge remove` first) — do NOT stack an opposing edge type on the same pair.
- Do not keep issuing near-duplicate retrieval queries without explaining why the previous retrieval was insufficient.
- Keep the reason short and grounded in observed evidence from this task.

## Few-Shot

Example 1, do NOT mutate:

- Observation: a single command returned a simple error you have not yet inspected.
- You tried an action once and have not yet checked state, logs, or input assumptions.
- Next step: inspect state before editing the graph.

Example 2, DO mutate — propose first, then commit:

- Observation: a handoff between two loaded skills failed in a way you find reasonable to encode (e.g. one skill plainly needs the other's setup output).
- Step A (propose; never mutates — `--reason` is the evidence you stake before seeing prior history):

  ```bash
  skilldag graph propose-edge <skill_a> <skill_b> depends_on --reason "<concise evidence from this task>"
  ```

- If the next response shows `{"result": {"would": {..., "reason": "<your reason>"}, "related": []}}` — empty related, safe to commit.
- Step B (commit; the same reason can be reused):

  ```bash
  skilldag graph edit-edge add <skill_a> <skill_b> depends_on --reason "<concise evidence from this task>"
  ```

Example 3, propose surfaces a contradiction — retype instead of add:

- Observation from `propose-edge`: `related` contains a prior `depends_on(A, B)` with reason "earlier reasoning" written by another task.
- Your new evidence says A+B actually conflict. Adding a second, contradictory edge is wrong; retype the existing one.

  ```bash
  skilldag graph edit-edge retype <skill_a> <skill_b> --from depends_on --to conflicts_with --reason "<current evidence contradicting earlier>"
  ```

## Reading the Output

`skilldag show <skill_id>` prints the SKILL.md body. Do not scan the skill library or infer filesystem locations; use only SkillDAG CLI retrieval outputs as the source of skill bodies.

Before implementing, inspect the task requirements, tests, and verifier and identify the minimum acceptance requirements.

Priorities:

1. Take the shortest path to passing the verifier.
2. Pass only the verifier's minimum required behavior first.
3. Do not scan the filesystem for skill directories; retrieve skill bodies only through `skilldag show <id>`.
4. Reuse or adapt retrieved interfaces when they directly fit the verifier target.
5. If a retrieved skill contains an authoritative calculator, validator, parser, or pack/unpack workflow, use that exact interface for the final output and final self-check.
6. Treat skills as a way to shrink the search space, not as permission to explore more implementation branches.
7. Avoid extra features, UI expansion, side outputs, or generalization unless explicitly required.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the task and form a short retrieval query containing `goal + artifact/format + operation/API + verifier-critical constraint`
2. Run `skilldag graph search "<targeted query>" --top-k 5`
3. Record whether retrieval returned any skills
4. Inspect task requirements/tests/verifier and write down the minimum acceptance requirements
5. For each relevant skill id, run `skilldag show <id>` to read the full body (use multi-id form when several look relevant)
6. Use or adapt retrieved interfaces only if they directly help satisfy the minimum requirements
7. If no returned interface directly fits, stay on the shortest no-frills path to verifier pass
8. Before finalizing, run one verifier-aligned self-check with the retrieved skill's authoritative interface when available
