description: AI-powered testability assessment using 10 principles of intrinsic testability with Playwright. Evaluates web applications against Observability, Controllability, Algorithmic Simplicity, Transparency, Stability, Explainability, Unbugginess, Smallness, Decomposability, and Similarity. Use when assessing software testability, evaluating test readiness, identifying testability improvements, or generating testability reports. Use when this capability is needed.

# Testability Scoring

<default_to_action>
When assessing testability:
1. RUN assessment against target URL
2. ANALYZE all 10 principles automatically
3. GENERATE HTML report with radar chart
4. PRIORITIZE improvements by impact/effort
5. INTEGRATE with QX Partner for holistic view

**Quick Assessment:**
```bash
# Run assessment on any URL
TEST_URL='https://example.com/' npx playwright test tests/testability-scoring/testability-scoring.spec.js --project=chromium --workers=1

# Or use shell script wrapper
.claude/skills/testability-scoring/scripts/run-assessment.sh https://example.com/
```

**The 10 Principles at a Glance:**
| Principle | Weight | Key Question |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Observability** | 15% | Can we see what's happening? |
| **Controllability** | 15% | Can we control the application? |
| **Algorithmic Simplicity** | 10% | Are behaviors predictable? |
| **Algorithmic Transparency** | 10% | Can we understand what it does? |
| **Algorithmic Stability** | 10% | Does behavior remain consistent? |
| **Explainability** | 10% | Is the interface understandable? |
| **Unbugginess** | 10% | How error-free is it? |
| **Smallness** | 10% | Are components appropriately sized? |
| **Decomposability** | 5% | Can we test parts in isolation? |
| **Similarity** | 5% | Is the tech stack familiar? |

**Grade Scale:**
- **A (90-100)**: Excellent testability
- **B (80-89)**: Good testability
- **C (70-79)**: Adequate testability
- **D (60-69)**: Below average
- **F (0-59)**: Poor testability

## Quick Reference Card

### Running Assessments

| Method | Command | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Shell Script | `./scripts/run-assessment.sh URL` | One-time assessment |
| ENV Override | `TEST_URL='URL' npx playwright test...` | CI/CD integration |
| Config File | Update `tests/testability-scoring/config.js` | Repeated runs |

### Principle Details

#### High Weight (15% each)
| Principle | Measures | Indicators |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Observability** | State visibility, logging, monitoring | Console output, network tracking, error visibility |
| **Controllability** | Input control, state manipulation | API access, test data injection, determinism |

#### Medium Weight (10% each)
| Principle | Measures | Indicators |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Simplicity** | Predictable behavior | Clear I/O relationships, low complexity |
| **Transparency** | Understanding what system does | Visible processes, readable code |
| **Stability** | Consistent behavior | Change resilience, maintainability |
| **Explainability** | Interface understanding | Good docs, semantic structure, help text |
| **Unbugginess** | Error-free operation | Console errors, warnings, runtime issues |
| **Smallness** | Component size | Element count, script bloat, page complexity |

#### Low Weight (5% each)
| Principle | Measures | Indicators |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Decomposability** | Isolation testing | Component separation, modular design |
| **Similarity** | Technology familiarity | Standard frameworks, known patterns |

## Assessment Workflow

```
1. Navigate to URL → 2. Collect Metrics → 3. Score Principles
                                              ↓
4. Generate JSON ← 5. Calculate Grades ← 6. Apply Weights
         ↓
7. Generate HTML Report with Radar Chart
         ↓
8. Open in Browser (auto-opens)
```

### Output Files

```
tests/reports/
├── testability-results-<timestamp>.json  # Raw data
├── testability-report-<timestamp>.html   # Visual report
└── latest.json                           # Symlink
```

## Integration Examples

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions
- name: Testability Assessment
  run: |
    timeout 180 .claude/skills/testability-scoring/scripts/run-assessment.sh ${{ env.APP_URL }}

- name: Upload Reports
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: testability-reports
    path: tests/reports/testability-*.html
```

### QX Partner Integration
```typescript
// Combine testability with QX analysis
const qxAnalysis = await Task("QX Analysis", {
  target: 'https://example.com',
  integrateTestability: true
}, "qx-partner");

// Returns combined insights:
// - QX Score: 78/100
// - Testability Integration: Observability 72/100
// - Combined Insight: Low observability may mask UX issues
```

### Programmatic Usage
```typescript
import { runTestabilityAssessment } from './testability';

const results = await runTestabilityAssessment('https://example.com');
console.log(`Overall: ${results.overallScore}/100 (${results.grade})`);
console.log('Recommendations:', results.recommendations);
```

---

## Agent Integration

```typescript
// Run testability assessment
const assessment = await Task("Testability Assessment", {
  url: 'https://example.com',
  generateReport: true,
  openBrowser: true
}, "qe-quality-analyzer");

// Use with QX Partner for holistic analysis
const qxReport = await Task("Full QX Analysis", {
  target: 'https://example.com',
  integrateTestability: true,
  detectOracleProblems: true
}, "qx-partner");
```

---

## Agent Coordination Hints

### Memory Namespace
```
aqe/testability/
├── assessments/*       - Assessment results by URL
├── historical/*        - Historical scores for trend analysis
├── recommendations/*   - Improvement recommendations
└── integration/*       - QX integration data
```

### Fleet Coordination
```typescript
const testabilityFleet = await FleetManager.coordinate({
  strategy: 'testability-assessment',
  agents: [
    'qe-quality-analyzer',  // Primary assessment
    'qx-partner',           // UX integration
    'qe-visual-tester'      // Visual validation
  ],
  topology: 'sequential'
});
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Tests timing out | Increase timeout: `timeout 300 ./scripts/run-assessment.sh URL` |
| Partial results | Check console errors, increase network timeout |
| Report not opening | Use `AUTO_OPEN=false`, open manually |
| Config not updating | Use `TEST_URL` env var instead |

## Remember

**Testability is an investment, not an afterthought.**

Good testability:
- Reduces debugging time
- Enables faster feedback loops
- Makes defects easier to find
- Supports continuous testing

**Low scores = High risk. Prioritize improvements by weight × impact.**
