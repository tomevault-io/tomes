# Skill: Create RFD (Request for Discussion)

## Overview

RFDs (Requests for Discussion) capture ideas, explore options, and document decisions before implementation. Inspired by IETF's RFC tradition, they enable sharing incomplete ideas early for better outcomes.

**Core Principles:**
- Share early, refine together
- Document options, not just decisions
- Capture context for future readers
- Build consensus before implementation

**Philosophy**: "Ideas should be timely rather than polished." — Oxide Computer Company, RFD 1

## When to Use This Skill

| Scenario | Use RFD | Use PRD |
|----------|---------|---------|
| "Should we use Redis or PostgreSQL for sessions?" | ✅ | |
| "Build session management with Redis" | | ✅ |
| "Exploring authentication approaches" | ✅ | |
| "Implement OAuth with Google and GitHub" | | ✅ |
| "Should we adopt a new framework?" | ✅ | |
| Multiple valid options, need discussion | ✅ | |
| Requirements clear, need implementation plan | | ✅ |

**Key Distinction:**
- **RFD** = "Why" and "What options" (explore, discuss, decide)
- **PRD** = "What" and "How" (plan, implement, deliver)

**Typical Flow:**
```
Idea → RFD (explore options) → Decision → PRD (define implementation) → Tasks → Code
```

## RFD States (Lifecycle)

```
Prediscussion → Ideation → Discussion → Published → Committed
                    ↓           ↓
                    └─────→ Abandoned
```

| State | Description | Location |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Prediscussion** | Very early, author still forming idea | `.claude/rfd/` |
| **Ideation** | Ready for informal feedback, not finalized | `.claude/rfd/` |
| **Discussion** | Open for team discussion, seeking consensus | `docs/rfd/` |
| **Published** | Decision made, documented for reference | `docs/rfd/` |
| **Committed** | Implemented, part of the codebase | `docs/rfd/` |
| **Abandoned** | Proposal rejected or superseded | `docs/rfd/` |

## Process Overview

### 1. Receive Topic

User describes what they want to explore or decide:
- "I'm considering whether to use GraphQL or REST for the API"
- "We need to decide on a caching strategy"
- "Exploring options for real-time updates"
- "Should we migrate from Express to Fastify?"

### 2. Check Context

Before asking questions:
1. **Read `CLAUDE.md`** for tech stack and constraints
2. **Check `rfd-index.yaml`** for related existing RFDs
3. **Scan codebase** for existing implementations
4. **Review `CLAUDE.md`** for established conventions

### 3. Ask Discovery Questions

**IMPORTANT**: Ask clarifying questions to understand the problem space. Provide numbered options for easy responses.

**Core Questions** (adapt based on topic):

**Problem/Goal:**
- What problem are you trying to solve?
- What outcome do you want to achieve?

**Constraints:**
- What constraints exist? (technical, team, timeline, budget)
- Any hard requirements that eliminate options?

**Stakeholders:**
- Who needs to weigh in on this decision?
- Is this a solo decision or team consensus needed?

**Timeline:**
- When does this decision need to be made?
- Is this urgent or can it wait for more research?

**Options Awareness:**
- Have you already considered some options?
- Are there approaches you've ruled out?

**Success Criteria:**
- How will you know if the decision was good?
- What would success look like?

**Reversibility:**
- How hard would it be to change this decision later?
- Is this a one-way door or two-way door?

### 4. Research Options

Based on user answers:
1. Identify 2-4 viable options
2. Research each option (existing patterns, industry practices)
3. Document pros and cons for each
4. Note any options considered and rejected (with reasons)

### 5. Generate RFD

Create RFD using the template structure (see below).

**Target Audience**: Team members and future developers (clear, explicit, no jargon)

### 6. Determine Initial State

| If... | Initial State | Location |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Very rough idea, author still thinking | Prediscussion | `.claude/rfd/` |
| Ready for informal feedback | Ideation | `.claude/rfd/` |
| Ready for team discussion | Discussion | `docs/rfd/` |

**Default**: Start in **Ideation** state.

### 7. Save and Update Index

1. **Get next RFD number** from `rfd-index.yaml` (`next_number` field)
2. **Create RFD file** in appropriate location based on state
3. **Update `rfd-index.yaml`**:
   - Add new entry to `rfds` array
   - Increment `next_number`
4. **Inform user** of file location and next steps

## RFD Template Structure

```markdown
---
rfd: NNNN
title: Short Descriptive Title
authors:
  - name: Author Name
state: Ideation
labels: []
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
discussion: null
related_prd: null

- Public: `NNNN.md` (e.g., `0042.md`)

**Index Update**: Add entry to `rfd-index.yaml`

## State Transitions

### Promoting an RFD

**Ideation → Discussion:**
1. Update state in frontmatter to "Discussion"
2. Move file from `.claude/rfd/` to `docs/rfd/`
3. Rename to `NNNN.md` format
4. Create GitHub discussion (optional)
5. Update `rfd-index.yaml` with new path and discussion link

**Discussion → Published:**
1. Update state in frontmatter to "Published"
2. Ensure "Proposal" section has final decision
3. Remove or answer all "Open Questions"
4. Update `rfd-index.yaml`
5. Can now create PRD if implementation needed

**Published → Committed:**
1. Update state in frontmatter to "Committed"
2. Add links to implementation PRs/commits in References
3. Update `rfd-index.yaml`

### Abandoning an RFD

1. Update state in frontmatter to "Abandoned"
2. Add note at top explaining why:
   > **Note**: This RFD was abandoned on [date] because [reason].
3. Keep file for historical reference (do not delete)
4. Update `rfd-index.yaml`

### Commands for State Transitions

User can request:
- "Promote RFD 0042 to Discussion"
- "Mark RFD 0042 as Published - we're going with Option A"
- "Abandon RFD 0042 - no longer relevant"
- "Mark RFD 0042 as Committed - implementation complete"

## Linking RFD to PRD

When an RFD decision leads to implementation:

1. **RFD side**: Add to frontmatter: `related_prd: 0005-prd-feature-name.md`
2. **PRD side**: Add to frontmatter: `source_rfd: 0042`
3. **Cross-reference**: Add RFD link to PRD's "Technical Considerations" section

**Workflow:**
```
1. Complete RFD, state = Published
2. Use .claude/skills/create-prd/SKILL.md
3. PRD references RFD decision
4. When PRD implementation complete, mark RFD as Committed
```

## Embedded Mode (Suggest Only)

### When AI Should Suggest Creating an RFD

During regular development, suggest an RFD when:

1. **User asks comparison question**: "Should we use X or Y?"
2. **AI discusses multiple approaches**: Presenting 2+ options with pros/cons
3. **Architectural decision point**: Choice that affects system design
4. **Significant deviation**: Proposing change from existing patterns
5. **Future reference valuable**: Decision others would want to understand

### Suggestion Format

```
I notice we're discussing multiple approaches for [topic]. Would you like me
to create an RFD to formally document these options? This will help:

- Capture the pros/cons of each approach
- Document our decision rationale
- Provide context for future developers

Shall I create RFD [next_number]: [suggested title]?
```

### If User Confirms

1. Follow the standard RFD creation process
2. Start in **Ideation** state (in `.claude/rfd/`)
3. Include context from current discussion
4. Present completed RFD for review

### If User Declines

Continue with the conversation normally. The discussion itself provides some documentation via conversation history.

## Tips for Good RFDs

### Content Quality

- **Be honest about tradeoffs**: Every option has cons
- **Include rejected options**: Future readers need to know what was considered
- **Quantify when possible**: "50ms vs 200ms" beats "faster vs slower"
- **Link to evidence**: External resources, benchmarks, case studies

### Process Quality

- **Share early**: Don't polish in isolation
- **Keep scope focused**: One decision per RFD
- **Update as you learn**: RFDs can evolve during discussion
- **Close the loop**: Move to Published/Committed/Abandoned

### Common Mistakes

- ❌ Only documenting the chosen option (document all considered)
- ❌ Waiting until decision is made to write (write to facilitate decision)
- ❌ Scope creep (multiple decisions in one RFD)
- ❌ Abandoning without explanation (always note why)
- ❌ Never updating state (stale "Discussion" RFDs)

## When NOT to Use RFD

Skip RFD for:

- **Obvious decisions**: Only one viable option
- **Small scope**: Won't affect others, easily reversible
- **Already decided**: Discussion already happened elsewhere
- **Implementation details**: HOW not WHAT (use PRD instead)
- **Urgent fixes**: Document post-hoc if needed

## Related Workflows

| Workflow | Relationship |
|----------|--------------|
| **create-prd** | Creates implementation plan after RFD decision |
| **document-work** | Can identify mini-RFDs worth promoting |
| **generate-tasks** | Breaks down PRD (which may reference RFD) |

## Instructions for AI

### DO:

1. ✅ **Ask discovery questions** (understand problem space)
2. ✅ **Research multiple options** (even if user suggests one)
3. ✅ **Document rejected options** (with reasons)
4. ✅ **Reference existing context** (project.md, patterns.md, other RFDs)
5. ✅ **Suggest RFDs during discussions** (embedded mode)

### DO NOT:

1. ❌ **Start implementation** (RFD is for discussion, not action)
2. ❌ **Force a recommendation** (seeking input is valid)
3. ❌ **Skip the index update** (rfd-index.yaml must be current)

### After RFD Created:

1. Save to appropriate location based on state
2. Update `rfd-index.yaml`
3. Inform user of file location
4. Suggest next steps:
   - Review and refine
   - Promote to Discussion when ready
   - Or: "Create PRD from RFD NNNN" when decision is made

---

**Remember**: RFDs capture the "why" behind decisions. A year from now, someone will read this and understand not just what was decided, but why other options were rejected. That context is invaluable.
