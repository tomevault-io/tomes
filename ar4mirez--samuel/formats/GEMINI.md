## Boundaries (Do Not Touch)

### Protected Files
- `go.sum` (dependency lock)
- `.github/workflows/` (CI/CD configurations)
- `.goreleaser.yaml` (release automation)
- `go.mod` (without testing build)

### Never Commit
- Secrets, API keys, credentials, tokens
- `.env` files
- `bin/`, build artifacts, the root `samuel` binary
- `.claude/settings.local.json` (personal settings)

### Ask Before Modifying
- Template files in `template/` (affects all users)
- Public CLI command interfaces (breaks user scripts)
- Registry data in `internal/core/registry.go` (component definitions)
- Build/deploy processes (Makefile, .goreleaser.yaml)

---

## Project Context

### Tech Stack
- **Language**: Go 1.21+
- **CLI Framework**: Cobra
- **UI**: fatih/color, manifoldco/promptui, schollz/progressbar
- **Config**: gopkg.in/yaml.v3
- **HTTP**: net/http (standard library)
- **Archive**: archive/tar, compress/gzip (standard library)
- **Docs**: MkDocs with Material theme (Python)

**Core Flow**: User command → GitHub download → Tar extraction → Local files
**Caching**: Downloaded versions cached in `~/.cache/samuel/`
**Config**: Project config in `samuel.yaml`

### Key Design Decisions

- **template/ directory**: Separates distributable files from project source. CLI paths use `template/` prefix for extraction.
- **GitHub archive downloads**: Uses GitHub's tar.gz API — no git required on user machines.
- **Standard Go layout**: `cmd/` + `internal/` at root. `internal/commands/` (not `cmd/`) to avoid confusion.
- **Go for CLI**: Single binary, cross-platform, no runtime dependencies. Cobra for CLI framework.
- **Auto (Ralph Wiggum)**: Autonomous AI coding loop. Tasks stored in `.claude/auto/prd.json`, progress in `progress.md`, orchestrated by Go-native loop. Supports PRD-based and zero-setup pilot modes.

## Quick Reference

**Task Classification:**
- **ATOMIC** (<5 files, clear scope) → Implement directly
- **FEATURE** (5-10 files) → Break into subtasks
- **COMPLEX** (>10 files, new subsystem) → Use PRD workflow | .claude/skills/create-prd/SKILL.md

**Common Guardrails** (validate first):
- Function ≤50 lines | File ≤300 lines | Input validation | Parameterized queries
- Tests >80% (critical) | Conventional commits | No secrets in code

**Emergency Quick Links:**
- Security issue? → .claude/skills/security-audit/SKILL.md
- Tests failing? → .claude/skills/troubleshooting/SKILL.md
- Stuck >30 min? → .claude/skills/troubleshooting/SKILL.md
- Complex feature? → .claude/skills/create-prd/SKILL.md
- Code review? → .claude/skills/code-review/SKILL.md
- Go-specific? → .claude/skills/go-guide/SKILL.md

**Skills** (capability modules - [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard):
- Create: `samuel skill create <name>` or `.claude/skills/create-skill/SKILL.md`
- Validate: `samuel skill validate`
- List: `samuel skill list`
- Load: `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` when task matches description

**Autonomous Mode (Ralph Wiggum methodology):**

- Initialize: `samuel auto init --prd .claude/tasks/NNNN-prd-feature.md`
- Start loop: `samuel auto start`
- Check status: `samuel auto status`
- Manage tasks: `samuel auto task list|complete|skip|reset|add`

## Core Guardrails (ALWAYS ENFORCE)

### Code Quality
- No function exceeds 50 lines (split with helper functions)
- No file exceeds 300 lines (components: 200, tests: 300, utils: 150)
- Cyclomatic complexity ≤ 10 per function
- All exported functions have type signatures and documentation
- No magic numbers (use named constants)
- No commented-out code in commits (use git history)
- No `TODO` without issue/ticket reference
- No dead code (unused imports, variables, functions)

### Security (CRITICAL)
- All user inputs validated before processing
- All API boundaries have input validation
- All file operations validate paths (prevent directory traversal)
- All async operations have timeout/cancellation mechanisms
- Dependencies checked for known vulnerabilities before adding
- Dependencies checked for license compatibility before adding

### Testing (CRITICAL)
- Coverage targets: >80% for business logic, >60% overall
- All public APIs have unit tests
- All bug fixes include regression tests
- All edge cases explicitly tested (null, empty, boundary values)
- Test names describe behavior: `TestComputeDiff_Sorting`
- No test interdependencies (tests run in any order)
- Table-driven tests for functions with multiple scenarios

### Git & Commits
- Commit messages: `type(scope): description` (conventional commits)
- Types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci
- One logical change per commit (atomic commits)
- All commits must pass tests before pushing
- Branch naming: `type/short-description` (e.g., `feat/user-auth`)
- Breaking API changes require major version bump (Semantic Versioning)

## 4D Methodology

### ATOMIC Mode (Default)
1. **Deconstruct**: What's the minimal change needed?
2. **Diagnose**: Will this break anything? Check dependencies.
3. **Develop**: Make the change with tests.
4. **Deliver**: Validate (run tests, check guardrails) → Commit.

### FEATURE Mode
1. **Deconstruct**: Break into 3-5 subtasks (each atomic).
2. **Diagnose**: Identify integration points and dependencies.
3. **Develop**: Implement subtasks sequentially with tests.
4. **Deliver**: Integration test → Documentation → Review → Commit.

### COMPLEX Mode
1. **Deconstruct**: Full decomposition into phases/milestones.
2. **Diagnose**: Analyze risks, dependencies, migration paths.
3. **Develop**: Plan implementation → Execute incrementally.
4. **Deliver**: Staged rollout → Documentation → Retrospective.

**Workflow for COMPLEX tasks:**
1. Use `.claude/skills/create-prd/SKILL.md` to define requirements
2. Use `.claude/skills/generate-tasks/SKILL.md` to break down implementation
3. Implement tasks step-by-step with verification checkpoints

**Escalation Triggers:**
- Task affects >5 files → FEATURE mode
- Task affects >10 files → COMPLEX mode (consider PRD workflow)
- Task affects >15 files OR new subsystem → COMPLEX mode (PRD workflow MANDATORY)

## Software Development Lifecycle

### Stage 1: Planning
**Atomic**: Read existing code → Identify change location
**Feature**: Review related code → Sketch interfaces/contracts
**Complex**: Use PRD workflow

### Stage 2: Implementation
- Write tests first (TDD) or alongside code
- Load Go guide: .claude/skills/go-guide/SKILL.md
- Follow Go idioms (error handling, naming, packages)
- Validate against guardrails continuously

### Stage 3: Validation
- `make test` — full test suite with race detection
- `go vet ./...` — static analysis
- `go build ./...` — verify build

### Stage 4: Documentation
- Exported function godocs (what, why, params, returns)
- Inline comments for complex logic (why, not what)

### Stage 5: Commit
```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "type(scope): description"
```

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

- Premature optimization (measure first, optimize after)
- Over-engineering (YAGNI)
- Copy-paste code (extract to shared function)
- Ignoring errors (every error needs handling)
- Testing implementation details (test behavior, not internals)
- Flaky tests (non-deterministic = bad design)
- Batch commits (commit after each logical change)
- Skipping tests because "it's a small change"

---

## When Stuck

**See:** `.claude/skills/troubleshooting/SKILL.md`

1. STOP trying random solutions (>30 min = stuck)
2. Document what you've tried
3. Simplify & isolate (minimal reproduction)
4. Check fundamentals (dependencies, config, versions)
5. Ask user with clear problem statement

---

**Remember**: This file is your guardrails. Small atomic changes. Validate continuously.

**Cross-Tool Compatibility**: AGENTS.md is a copy of this file.
