description: Structured `.pdf` operations: extract text/tables, merge pages from multiple PDFs, split a PDF by page ranges, fill PDF form fields, and generate fresh PDFs from JSON. Trigger when the user wants deterministic programmatic PDF work — examples: pull tables from a report, combine three PDFs, extract pages 5-12, fill a tax form, or build a new PDF from data. This is the single public PDF entry and uses pypdf, pdfplumber, and reportlab. Use when this capability is needed.

# pdf-toolkit

Deterministic, structural PDF operations. Use this skill for programmatic
work where you know exactly what you want done. For a natural-language rewrite,
first draft the replacement content with ordinary reasoning, then use the
explicit extract/generate/merge operations here to create the final PDF.

## Decide the operation

| Goal | Script |
|---|---|
| Get text or tables out of a PDF | `extract.py` |
| Combine pages from multiple PDFs | `merge.py` |
| Split a PDF by page ranges | `split.py` |
| Fill `/Tx` form fields in a PDF | `form_fill.py` |
| Build a new PDF from data | inline `reportlab` snippet, see Path C below |

---

## Path A: Extract

```bash
python {baseDir}/scripts/extract.py /path/to/doc.pdf --json
```

Output:

```json
{
  "pages": 12,
  "metadata": {"title": "...", "author": "..."},
  "text": [
    {"page": 1, "content": "..."},
    {"page": 2, "content": "..."}
  ],
  "tables": [
    {"page": 3, "rows": [["..."], ["..."]]}
  ]
}
```

Text uses `pdfplumber` (already in default dependencies) which preserves
column layout better than naive PDF text extraction. Tables use
`pdfplumber.extract_tables()` with default settings; for tricky layouts
pass `--tables-strategy lines|text|explicit` to switch detection mode.

For OCR (scanned PDFs), this skill does not include Tesseract — use the
sibling skill that wraps an OCR engine (out of scope here).

---

## Path B: Merge / Split

Merge full files:

```bash
python {baseDir}/scripts/merge.py a.pdf b.pdf c.pdf --out combined.pdf
```

Or merge specific page ranges with the manifest form:

```bash
python {baseDir}/scripts/merge.py manifest.json --out combined.pdf
```

`manifest.json`:

```json
[
  {"file": "a.pdf", "pages": "1-3"},
  {"file": "b.pdf", "pages": "5,7,9-11"},
  {"file": "c.pdf"}
]
```

Page ranges are 1-based, comma-separated, hyphen for ranges. Omit `pages` to
include the whole file. Splits use the same syntax in reverse:

```bash
python {baseDir}/scripts/split.py input.pdf --pages "1-3,7,10-12" --out output_dir/
```

Each range writes one output file: `output_dir/input_001.pdf`,
`output_dir/input_002.pdf`, …

---

## Path C: Form fill

```bash
python {baseDir}/scripts/form_fill.py form.pdf data.json --out filled.pdf
```

`data.json` maps field name → string value:

```json
{
  "applicant_name": "Wei E.",
  "submission_date": "2026-05-06",
  "agreed": "Yes"
}
```

The script discovers fields via `pypdf.PdfReader.get_fields()` and updates
them with `update_page_form_field_values()`. Fields not present in the JSON
are left untouched. Run with `--list-fields` to enumerate the form's fields
without filling.

Caveats:

- `/Btn` checkbox fields take the export value (often `Yes`, `On`, or `1`)
  rather than `true` — inspect with `--list-fields` to discover.
- AcroForm fills only. XFA forms (used by some legal templates) require
  Adobe-specific tooling and are out of scope.
- Some signed PDFs invalidate the signature when fields change. Strip
  signatures explicitly with `--clear-signatures` if that is intended.

---

## Path D: Generate from scratch

Use `reportlab` directly when you need a new PDF:

```python
from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas
from reportlab.lib.pagesizes import LETTER
from pathlib import Path

c = canvas.Canvas(str(Path("out.pdf")), pagesize=LETTER)
c.setFont("Helvetica-Bold", 18)
c.drawString(72, 720, "Q3 Review")
c.setFont("Helvetica", 11)
c.drawString(72, 696, "Revenue grew 18% year over year.")
c.showPage()
c.save()
```

For tables, headers/footers, and multi-column layouts, switch to
`reportlab.platypus` (`SimpleDocTemplate`, `Paragraph`, `Table`,
`PageBreak`). See [references/reportlab.md](references/reportlab.md).

---

## Natural-language changes

This public entry deliberately keeps the PDF mutation step deterministic. For
requests such as "make the title shorter", inspect the source page, draft the
replacement text with the model, and generate a new document with the reviewed
content. Do not claim that arbitrary in-place page rewriting is available.

---

## Common pitfalls

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Extracted text is empty | Scanned PDF, no text layer | OCR is out of scope; use a separate OCR skill |
| Garbled characters in extract | PDF uses a custom font encoding | Try `pdfplumber.open(path, laparams={...})` with `char_margin` adjustments |
| Merged PDF is huge | Underlying PDFs include large embedded fonts | Subset fonts via `pypdf` `compress_content_streams()` |
| Form fill silently no-ops | Field name in JSON does not match PDF field name | Run with `--list-fields` first to see exact names |
| Pages out of order after split | Range overlap collapsed unexpectedly | Use disjoint ranges, e.g. `1-3,4-6` not `1-5,3-6` |

---

## Boundaries

- This skill works with text-based and form-based PDFs. Scanned image PDFs
  need OCR before any text path produces results.
- Encrypted PDFs are read-only here. Decryption requires the user-supplied
  password and is out of scope for this skill.
- For PDF-to-image rendering, use a separate skill that wraps Poppler or
  PyMuPDF.
- Digital signature operations (signing, verifying, revoking) are out of
  scope.
