Returns a JSON summary suitable for downstream LLM consumption. Used by meta-skill-creator's harvest step but also useful standalone for 'which skills did I use most this week? Use when this capability is needed.

# History Explorer

Lightweight read-only view over `~/.opensquilla/logs/decisions-*.jsonl`. Aggregates `DecisionEntry.skills_invoked` (SCHEMA_VERSION 10) into co-occurrence frequencies, joins with `SkillLoader.list_meta_specs()` for meta-skill usage stats, and surfaces the `tests/test_skills/router_fixtures/` corpus.

## Usage

```
uv run python {baseDir}/scripts/explore.py \
  --log-dir ~/.opensquilla/logs \
  --query "Co-occurring chains for PDF workflows" \
  --window-days 30 \
  --include co_occurrences,meta_usage,router_fixtures \
  --top-k 10
```

## Output

JSON to stdout with keys `co_occurrences`, `meta_usage`, `router_fixtures`, and a `placeholder` string when the log is empty.

## Fallback

If no decision-log exists, return an empty result with a placeholder string explaining "no history; downstream should rely on user intent only".
