# PostgreSQL Best Practices

Comprehensive guidelines when working with PostgreSQL database to build Gram which include rules for schema design, database migration and application logic. All rules are kept in a rules folder with names of each rule outlined below (e.g. `rules/<rule-name>.md`).

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Creating database migrations
- Writing queries used in application code especially with SQLc
- Updating existing database schemas
- Creating pull requests that involve database changes

## Rules

- **Code Formatting and Comments:**
  - Maintain consistent code formatting using a tool like `pgformatter` or similar.
  - Use clear and concise comments to explain complex logic and intentions. Update comments regularly to avoid confusion.
  - Use inline comments sparingly; prefer block comments for detailed explanations.
  - Write comments in plain, easy-to-follow English.
  - Add a space after line comments (`-- a comment`); do not add a space for commented-out code (`--raise notice`).
  - Keep comments up-to-date; incorrect comments are worse than no comments.

- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Use `snake_case` for identifiers (e.g., `user_id`, `customer_name`).
  - Use plural nouns for table names (e.g., `customers`, `products`).
  - Use consistent naming conventions for functions, procedures, and triggers.
  - Choose descriptive and meaningful names for all database objects.

- **Data Integrity and Data Types:**
  - Use appropriate data types for columns to ensure data integrity (e.g., `INTEGER`, `VARCHAR`, `TIMESTAMP`).
  - Use constraints (e.g., `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `FOREIGN KEY`) to enforce data integrity.
  - Define primary keys for all tables.
  - Use foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.
  - Utilize domains to enforce data type constraints reusable across multiple columns.
  - All foreign keys constraints must ALWAYS specify an `ON DELETE SET NULL` clause.

- **Indexing:**
  - Create indexes on columns frequently used in `WHERE` clauses and `JOIN` conditions.
  - Avoid over-indexing, as it can slow down write operations.
  - Consider using partial indexes for specific query patterns.
  - Use appropriate index types (e.g., `B-tree`, `Hash`, `GIN`, `GiST`) based on the data and query requirements.

- **Schema evolution:**
  - Use expand-contract pattern instead of removing existing columns from a schema. Introduce new columns instead when appropriate.
  - ALWAYS call out when making a backwards incompatible schema change.
  - Suggest running `mise db:diff <migration-name>` after making schema changes to generate a migration file. Replace `<migration-name>` with a clear snake-case migration id such as `users-add-email-column`.
  - If you need to undo a migration then run: 1. `mise run db:reset` 2. `mise run db:migrate` to re-run all migrations from the beginning.

<relevant-tasks>

- `mise run db:diff <name-of-migrations>`: Create a database migration
- `mise run db:reset`: Drop the database and re-create it. No migrations applied at this point.
- `mise run db:migrate`: Run all pending database migrations. If you have just reset the database, this will run all migrations from the beginning.

## Schema design rules

### Multi-tenancy by project

When creating any tables, add a non-nullable column named `project_id` of type `uuid` with a foreign key constraint to the `projects` table. If appropriate to the nature and usage patterns of the table also include `organization_id TEXT NOT NULL` column.

### Change tracking

All tables should have `created_at` and `updated_at` columns:

```sql
create table if not exists example (
  -- ...
  created_at timestamptz not null default clock_timestamp(),
  updated_at timestamptz not null default clock_timestamp() on update clock_timestamp(),
  -- ...
);
```

### Always soft delete

A nullable `deleted_at` column may be added to tables to perform soft deletes:

```sql
create table if not exists example (
  -- ...
  deleted_at timestamptz,
  deleted boolean not null generated always as (deleted_at is not null) stored,
  -- ...
);
```

Deleting rows with `DELETE FROM table` is not strongly discouraged. Instead,
use:

```sql
UPDATE example SET deleted_at = clock_timestamp() WHERE id = ?;
```

### Constraint naming

All constraints should be named with this format:

```
{tablename}_{columnname(s)}_{suffix}
```

Where suffix is:

- `key` for a unique constraint
- `fkey` for a foreign key constraint
- `idx` for any other kind of index
- `check` for a check constraint
- `excl` for an exclusion constraint
- `seq` for an sequences

## Reviewing schema changes

### Backwards compatibity

Ensure that all schema changes are designed for backwards compatibility.

These are examples of terrible practices to avoid:

- Adding a non-nullable column to an existing table.
- Removing a column from a table.
- Changing the data type of an existing column.
- Renaming an existing column.
- Changing the meaning or usage of an existing column.
- Adding unique constraints or indexes to existing columns without considering the impact on existing data and queries.

Instead, strongly consider these better alternatives:

- Adding nullable columns to existing tables.
- Deprecating columns by making them nullable.
- Using expand-contract pattern for evolving schemas without causing outages.

## Writing queries with SQLc

All SQLc queries live in `**/queries.sql` files in the codebase. This is an important convention to maintain.

When writing SQLc queries, follow these guidelines:

- Use descriptive names for queries and parameters.
- Write clear and efficient SQL queries that follow best practices for performance and readability.
- Consume the corresponding database schema to understand what tables, columns, relationships and indexes exist.
- CRITICAL: No matter the query, it MUST ALWAYS be scoped to a `project_id` to explicitly limit the scope of writes.

<relevant-tasks>

- `mise run gen:sqlc-server`: generates Go code from SQLc queries
