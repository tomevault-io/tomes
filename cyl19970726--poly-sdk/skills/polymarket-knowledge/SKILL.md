# Polymarket Knowledge

## Overview

Comprehensive reference for Polymarket CLOB API integration, focusing on order management and real-time event handling.

## Quick Reference

### Order Types

| Type | Behavior | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| GTC | Good Till Cancelled | Maker orders, liquidity provision |
| GTD | Good Till Date | Time-limited orders |
| FOK | Fill Or Kill | Must fill completely or cancel |
| FAK | Fill And Kill | Fill what you can, cancel rest |

### Order Requirements

- Minimum order value: $1 USDC
- Minimum shares: 5
- Tick size: 0.01 (prices must be 0.01, 0.02, ... 0.99)

## Order State Machine

See [references/order-state-machine.md](references/order-state-machine.md) for complete state diagram and transitions.

**States**: PENDING → OPEN → PARTIALLY_FILLED → FILLED/CANCELLED/EXPIRED

**API Status Mapping**:
- `live` → OPEN
- `matched` (partial) → PARTIALLY_FILLED
- `matched` (full) → FILLED
- `delayed` → PENDING
- `cancelled` → CANCELLED
- `expired` → EXPIRED

## WebSocket Events

See [references/websocket-events.md](references/websocket-events.md) for field mappings and examples.

**Key Endpoints**:
- Market: `wss://ws-subscriptions-clob.polymarket.com/ws/market`
- User: `wss://ws-subscriptions-clob.polymarket.com/ws/user` (authenticated)

**USER_ORDER Event Types**: PLACEMENT, UPDATE, CANCELLATION
**USER_TRADE Statuses**: MATCHED, MINED, CONFIRMED, RETRYING, FAILED

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Wrong field names**: API uses `matched_amount` not `matched_size`, `size_matched` not `matched_size`
2. **Wrong endpoint**: USER events require `/ws/user`, not `/ws/market`
3. **USDC type**: Polymarket uses USDC.e (bridged), not native USDC
