# Account Research

Get a complete picture of any company or person before outreach. This skill always works with web search, and gets significantly better with enrichment and CRM data.

## How It Works

## Getting Started

Just tell me who to research:

- "Research Stripe"
- "Look up the CTO at Notion"
- "Intel on acme.com"
- "Who is Sarah Chen at TechCorp?"
- "Tell me about [company] before my call"

I'll run web searches immediately. If you have enrichment or CRM connected, I'll pull that data too.

## Connectors (Optional)

Connect your tools to supercharge this skill:

| Connector      | What It Adds                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Enrichment** | Verified emails, phone numbers, tech stack, org chart, funding details   |
| **CRM**        | Prior relationship history, past opportunities, existing contacts, notes |

> **No connectors?** No problem. Web search provides solid research for any company or person.
