# Update Command

Keep your task list and memory current. Two modes:

- **Default:** Sync tasks from external tools, triage stale items, check memory for gaps
- **`--comprehensive`:** Deep scan chat, email, calendar, docs — flag missed todos and suggest new memories

## Usage

```bash
productivity-update
productivity-update --comprehensive
```

## Default Mode

### 1. Load Current State

Read `TASKS.md` and `memory/` directory. If they don't exist, suggest `productivity-start` first.

### 2. Sync Tasks from External Sources

Check for available task sources:

- **Project tracker** (e.g. Asana, Linear, Jira) (if available)
- **GitHub Issues** (if in a repo): `gh issue list --assignee=@me`

If no sources are available, skip to Step 3.

**Fetch tasks assigned to the user** (open/in-progress). Compare against TASKS.md:

| External task                | TASKS.md match?        | Action                    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Found, not in TASKS.md       | No match               | Offer to add              |
| Found, already in TASKS.md   | Match by title (fuzzy) | Skip                      |
| In TASKS.md, not in external | No match               | Flag as potentially stale |
| Completed externally         | In Active section      | Offer to mark done        |

Present diff and let user decide what to add/complete.

### 3. Triage Stale Items

Review Active tasks in TASKS.md and flag:

- Tasks with due dates in the past
- Tasks in Active for 30+ days
- Tasks with no context (no person, no project)

Present each for triage: Mark done? Reschedule? Move to Someday?

### 4. Decode Tasks for Memory Gaps

For each task, attempt to decode all entities (people, projects, acronyms, tools, links):

```
Task: "Send PSR to Todd re: Phoenix blockers"

Decode:
- PSR → ✓ Pipeline Status Report (in glossary)
- Todd → ✓ Todd Martinez (in people/)
- Phoenix → ? Not in memory
```

Track what's fully decoded vs. what has gaps.

### 5. Fill Gaps

Present unknown terms grouped:

```
I found terms in your tasks I don't have context for:

1. "Phoenix" (from: "Send PSR to Todd re: Phoenix blockers")
   → What's Phoenix?

2. "Maya" (from: "sync with Maya on API design")
   → Who is Maya?
```

Add answers to the appropriate memory files (people/, projects/, glossary.md).

### 6. Capture Enrichment

Tasks often contain richer context than memory. Extract and update:

- **Links** from tasks → add to project/people files
- **Status changes** ("launch done") → update project status, demote from CONTEXT.md
- **Relationships** ("Todd's sign-off on Maya's proposal") → cross-reference people
- **Deadlines** → add to project files

### 7. Report

```
Update complete:
- Tasks: +3 from project tracker, 1 completed, 2 triaged
- Memory: 2 gaps filled, 1 project enriched
- All tasks decoded ✓
```
