# Copy Editing

Apply a repeatable editing system without changing core intent.

## Required Inputs

- Campaign slug
- Source draft path or pasted draft
- Intended channel and audience
- Primary conversion action

## Workflow

1. Read `scripts/marketing/_shared/product-marketing-context.md` if present. If missing, initialize from `references/product-marketing-context-template.md` included with this skill.
2. Establish editing goals and non-negotiables.
3. Apply sequential sweeps: clarity, tone, "so what", proof, specificity, emotion, final polish.
4. Track each material edit with a reason code.
5. Validate that edits did not break core message or CTA.

## Output Files

- `scripts/marketing/<slug>/12-copy-edit-review.md`
- `scripts/marketing/<slug>/13-final-polished-copy.md`
- `scripts/marketing/<slug>/13-edit-log.csv`

## QA Checklist

- Each major edit includes rationale.
- Final copy preserves original intent while increasing clarity.
- Proof and specificity gaps are reduced or flagged.
- Tone matches context doc rules.

## Failure Modes

- Over-rewrite risk: preserve message architecture and only refine.
- Voice drift: compare against context terms and tone rules.
- Conversion drift: re-check CTA prominence and user action path.

## Next Skill Routing

- Run `social-content` for distribution derivatives.
- Run `email-sequence` for lifecycle adaptations.
