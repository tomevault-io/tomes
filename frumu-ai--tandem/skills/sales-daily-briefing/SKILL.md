# Daily Sales Briefing

Get a clear view of what matters most today. This skill works with whatever you tell me, and gets richer when you connect your tools.

## How It Works

│  ✓ Output: scannable 2-minute briefing                          │

## Getting Started

When you run this skill, I'll ask for what I need:

**If no calendar connected:**

> "What meetings do you have today? (Just paste your calendar or list them)"

**If no CRM connected:**

> "What deals are you focused on this week? Any that need attention?"

**If you have connectors:**
I'll pull everything automatically and just show you the briefing.

## Connectors (Optional)

Connect your tools to supercharge this skill:

| Connector      | What It Adds                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Calendar**   | Today's meetings with attendees, times, and context           |
| **CRM**        | Open pipeline, deals closing soon, overdue tasks, stale deals |
| **Email**      | Unread from opportunity contacts, emails waiting on replies   |
| **Enrichment** | Overnight signals: funding, hiring, news on your accounts     |

> **No connectors?** No problem. Tell me your meetings and deals, and I'll create your briefing.
