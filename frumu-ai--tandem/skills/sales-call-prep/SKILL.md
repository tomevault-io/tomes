## Getting Started

When you run this skill, I'll ask for what I need:

**Required:**

- Company or contact name
- Meeting type (discovery, demo, negotiation, check-in, etc.)

**Helpful if you have it:**

- Who's attending (names and titles)
- Any context you want me to know (paste prior notes, emails, etc.)

If you've connected your CRM, email, or other tools, I'll pull context automatically and skip the questions.

## Connectors (Optional)

Connect your tools to supercharge this skill:

| Connector       | What It Adds                                                                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CRM**         | Account details, contact history, open deals, recent activities              |
| **Email**       | Recent threads with the company, open questions, attachments shared          |
| **Chat**        | Internal chat discussions (e.g. Slack) about the account, colleague insights |
| **Transcripts** | Prior call recordings, topics covered, competitor mentions                   |
| **Calendar**    | Auto-find the meeting, pull attendees and description                        |

> **No connectors?** No problem. Just tell me about the meeting and paste any context you have. I'll research the rest.
