# Copilot instructions — AskMyDocs

Mirror of `CLAUDE.md` (root) with the same rules. Whichever assistant edits
this repo, the rules are identical. Skills with detailed examples live under
`.claude/skills/`.

## 1. Project at a glance

AskMyDocs is an **enterprise RAG + canonical knowledge compilation** system
on **Laravel 13 + PostgreSQL + pgvector**. Markdown in, grounded answers
with citations out — over a **typed knowledge base** with a lightweight
graph, anti-repetition memory, and a human-gated promotion pipeline.
Optional chat history, feedback/few-shot, hybrid (semantic + FTS) search,
MCP server (10 tools), and a GitHub-Action-based cross-repo ingestion
pipeline. A full React SPA admin shell rides alongside at `/app/*`:
dashboard, users + roles + RBAC, canonical KB explorer with inline
editor and graph viewer, five-tab log viewer, whitelisted Artisan
maintenance runner, and a daily AI insights panel. Every admin page is
Spatie-role-gated and every mutation is audit-trailed
(`kb_canonical_audit` for canonical changes, `admin_command_audit` for
commands).

- PHP `^8.3`, Laravel `^13.0`, Sanctum `^4.2`.
- `symfony/yaml ^7.4|^8.0` for canonical YAML frontmatter parsing.
  Section-aware markdown chunking is custom (line-based fence-aware
  FSM in `MarkdownChunker`) — no external markdown parser library.
- `laravel/mcp ^0.7` as a suggest (required only when exposing the
  `enterprise-kb` MCP server).
- PostgreSQL ≥ 15 + `pgvector`. FTS GIN index migration ships pgsql-only.
- All providers run on the `laravel/ai` SDK (since v8.16/W2, ADR 0015 —
  reverses the earlier "No AI SDK" rule, so FinOps meters every provider
  natively). Anthropic + Gemini fully SDK; OpenAI + OpenRouter HYBRID —
  no-tools chat + embeddings via the SDK, the MCP with-tools turn on raw
  `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http` `/chat/completions` (the SDK can't host
  AskMyDocs's external-MCP tool loop). Regolo via the
  `padosoft/laravel-ai-regolo` SDK adapter. `laravel/ai` pinned `^0.6.8`.
- Tests: PHPUnit 12 + Orchestra Testbench 11 (SQLite) + Vitest for JS.

## 2. Core flows

**Chat** — `KbChatController` → `KbSearchService::searchWithContext()`
(pgvector + optional FTS + `Reranker` fusion `0.55·vec + 0.25·kw + 0.05·head`
shipped defaults, via `kb.reranking.*` + canonical boost + status penalty) → `GraphExpander` (1-hop walk of
`kb_edges` from canonical seeds, config-gated) → `RejectedApproachInjector`
(cosine-correlates query vs `rejected-approach` canonical docs) →
`SearchResult{ primary, expanded, rejected, meta }` → prompt from
`resources/views/prompts/kb_rag.blade.php` (typed blocks: `⚠ REJECTED
APPROACHES` + `📎 RELATED CONTEXT` + primary `## Context`) →
`AiManager::chat()` → `ChatLogManager::log()` (try/catch, never
propagates). Graph expansion + rejected injection no-op when no canonical
docs exist (zero regression for non-canonical consumers).

**Ingest** — two entrypoints converge on one execution path:

- `php artisan kb:ingest-folder` walks the KB disk, dispatches one job per
  file.
- `POST /api/kb/ingest` (Sanctum, ≤ 100 docs/call) writes to the KB disk,
  dispatches one job per doc.
- Both → `IngestDocumentJob` (`$tries = 3`, backoff `[10,30,60]`) →
  `DocumentIngestor::ingestMarkdown()` (SHA-256 upsert on
  `(project_key, source_path, version_hash)` — idempotent by construction).

**Canonical branch** — when the markdown has a valid YAML frontmatter,
`DocumentIngestor` populates the 8 canonical columns (`doc_id`, `slug`,
`canonical_type`, `canonical_status`, `is_canonical`, `retrieval_priority`,
`source_of_truth`, `frontmatter_json` with `_derived` slugs). Prior
canonical identifiers are vacated before the new version is inserted to
avoid violating the per-project composite uniques. After commit,
`CanonicalIndexerJob` populates `kb_nodes` + `kb_edges` from the
frontmatter `_derived` slug lists and every chunk's `metadata.wikilinks`.
Invalid frontmatter degrades gracefully to non-canonical (R4).

**Promotion pipeline** (ADR 0003, human-gated):
- `POST /api/kb/promotion/suggest` → LLM extracts candidates. Writes nothing.
- `POST /api/kb/promotion/candidates` → validates a draft. Writes nothing.
- `POST /api/kb/promotion/promote` → writes markdown + dispatches ingest.
  Returns 202.

Operator CLI equivalent: `kb:promote {path} --project=…`. Claude skills
stop at `suggest` / `candidates`. Only humans (git commit → GH action →
ingest) and operators (`kb:promote`) commit canonical storage.

**Delete** — `kb:delete` / `DELETE /api/kb/documents` /
`kb:ingest-folder --prune-orphans` / scheduled `kb:prune-deleted` all fan in
to `DocumentDeleter`. Default is soft delete (`KB_SOFT_DELETE_ENABLED=true`,
retention `KB_SOFT_DELETE_RETENTION_DAYS=30`). Hard delete **cascades the
graph**: `kb_nodes` owned by the doc are removed (`source_doc_id` match,
fallback `node_uid = slug`); the composite FK on `kb_edges` cascades both
directions. Every hard delete writes a `kb_canonical_audit` row.

**Scheduler** (`bootstrap/app.php`):

| Time  | Command                    |
| ----- | -------------------------- |
| 03:10 | `kb:prune-embedding-cache` |
| 03:20 | `chat-log:prune`           |
| 03:30 | `kb:prune-deleted`         |
| 03:40 | `kb:rebuild-graph`         |

All with `onOneServer()->withoutOverlapping()`. `--days=N` flag overrides the
env retention for ad-hoc runs; `0` disables. `kb:rebuild-graph` is a no-op
when no canonical docs exist.

## 4. Schemas to know

- **`knowledge_documents`** — `project_key`, `source_type`, `title`,
  `source_path`, `mime_type`, `language`, `access_scope`, `status`,
  `document_hash`, `version_hash` (both SHA-256), `metadata` JSON,
  `source_updated_at`, `indexed_at`, `deleted_at` (SoftDeletes).
  **Canonical columns**: `doc_id`, `slug`, `canonical_type`,
  `canonical_status`, `is_canonical` (default false),
  `retrieval_priority` (0-100, default 50), `source_of_truth` (default
  true), `frontmatter_json` (parsed YAML + `_derived` pre-validated
  slug lists). UNIQUE `(project_key, source_path, version_hash)` +
  composite uniques `(project_key, doc_id)` and `(project_key, slug)` —
  canonical identifiers are tenant-scoped.
- **`knowledge_chunks`** — `knowledge_document_id` FK ON DELETE CASCADE,
  `project_key`, `chunk_order`, `chunk_hash` (SHA-256), `heading_path`,
  `chunk_text`, `metadata` JSON (includes `wikilinks` array for canonical
  chunks), `embedding vector(N)`. UNIQUE `(knowledge_document_id,
  chunk_hash)`. GIN index on `to_tsvector(<lang>, chunk_text)` (pgsql
  only).
- **`kb_nodes`** — canonical graph node. `node_uid`, `node_type` (9 values),
  `label`, `project_key`, `source_doc_id`, `payload_json` (includes
  `dangling: true` for not-yet-canonicalized targets). UNIQUE
  `(project_key, node_uid)`.
- **`kb_edges`** — typed relation between nodes. `edge_uid`,
  `from_node_uid`, `to_node_uid`, `edge_type` (10 values), `project_key`,
  `source_doc_id`, `weight` (decimal 8,4), `provenance` (wikilink |
  frontmatter_* | inferred). UNIQUE `(project_key, edge_uid)`. **Composite
  FKs** project-scoped: `(project_key, from/to_node_uid)` →
  `kb_nodes.(project_key, node_uid)` with ON DELETE CASCADE (intra-project
  referential integrity). Cross-**tenant** isolation is the application-layer
  R30 `forTenant()` scope, not this FK (`project_key` is shared across tenants).
- **`kb_canonical_audit`** — immutable forensic trail. `project_key`,
  `doc_id?`, `slug?`, `event_type` (promoted | updated | deprecated |
  superseded | rejected_injection_used | graph_rebuild), `actor`,
  `before_json`, `after_json`, `metadata_json`, `created_at`. No
  `updated_at`; no FK to `knowledge_documents` so rows survive hard deletes.
- **`embedding_cache`** — `text_hash` (SHA-256), `provider`, `model`,
  `embedding vector(N)`, `last_used_at` (LRU prune). UNIQUE
  `(text_hash, provider, model)`. Intentionally NOT tenant-scoped — same
  text+provider+model across projects reuses the embedding.
- **`chat_logs`** — structured analytics; never the app log.
- **`conversations` / `messages`** — user-scoped history; `messages.metadata`
  stores citations + provider/model telemetry; `messages.rating` feeds
  `FewShotService`.

---

## 5. Non-obvious decisions — do not unwind without asking

- **All providers on the `laravel/ai` SDK** (v8.16/W2, ADR 0015). Anthropic +
  Gemini fully SDK; OpenAI + OpenRouter HYBRID (SDK for no-tools chat +
  embeddings, raw `Http::` `/chat/completions` for the MCP with-tools turn —
  the SDK can't host AskMyDocs's external-MCP loop). Regolo via the
  `padosoft/laravel-ai-regolo` SDK adapter. The `AiCallMeter` bridge now meters
  only the residual with-tools turn. Don't move that turn onto the SDK without
  a dedicated `Tool`-adapter ADR.
- **Chat and embeddings providers are independent** (`AI_PROVIDER` vs
  `AI_EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER`). Anthropic has no embeddings endpoint.
  OpenRouter exposes one (OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings`); default
  routed model is `openai/text-embedding-3-small` (1536 dims — matches
  the schema, no migration needed). Auto-fallback order when chat
  provider can't embed: openai → openrouter → regolo → gemini (1536-dim
  defaults first; regolo+gemini require pgvector resize, R14).
- **Embedding dimensions are part of the contract.** Changing the embeddings
  model requires migrating the `vector(N)` column, flushing
  `embedding_cache`, and re-indexing.
- **Soft delete is default.** Read paths inherit the Eloquent global scope;
  write/admin paths opt in via `withTrashed()` / `onlyTrashed()`.
- **Idempotency is guaranteed by the unique tuple** — never bypass the hash
  with `firstOrCreate`.
- **Logging never breaks the user request.** Wrap every chat-log driver in
  try/catch; errors go to the app log, not the client.
- **Two ingestion entrypoints, one execution path.** Never add a third path
  that skips `IngestDocumentJob` or `DocumentIngestor::ingestMarkdown()`.
- **Canonical markdown is source-of-truth; DB is a projection.** The
  canonical `kb/` folders in consumer repos are authoritative; `kb_nodes` +
  `kb_edges` are rebuildable from Git via `kb:rebuild-graph` + re-ingest.
  Never design features that require DB-only state unreconstructible from
  markdown. Only `kb_canonical_audit` is an exception (immutable forensic
  trail).
- **Promotion is always human-gated.** Claude skills and
  `suggest` / `candidates` produce drafts; only humans (via git → GH
  action) and operators (`kb:promote`) commit canonical storage (ADR 0003).
- **Rejected-approach injection is by design.** The prompt surfaces
  rejected options under `⚠` so the LLM stops re-proposing them. Disable
  via `KB_REJECTED_INJECTION_ENABLED=false` only when prompt-token budget
  is critical.
- **Graph expansion + rejected injection degrade to no-op** when a tenant
  has zero canonical docs. Code MUST NOT assume either feature is
  populated.
- **Canonical slug + doc_id are tenant-scoped.** Two projects can share
  `dec-cache-v2`. Composite FKs on `kb_edges` make cross-tenant edges
  impossible. Never assume global uniqueness in new code.

## 6. Review rules (R1–R22) — read this before reviewing or coding

These are distilled from actual Copilot comments on PRs #4, #5, #6 and the
canonical compilation series PRs #9–#14. The skills in
`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` carry worked examples.

### R1 — Use `App\Support\KbPath::normalize()` for every KB source path
Never re-implement path trimming. `KbPath::normalize()` collapses `//`,
converts `\\`, rejects `.` / `..` (traversal guard), throws on empty input.
Ingest and delete **must** produce identical paths.

### R2 — Soft-delete awareness
Default scope (hide trashed) is correct for readers. Any branch that must
act on already-trashed rows — e.g. `--force` hard delete, retention purge,
diagnostics — has to `withTrashed()` / `onlyTrashed()`. The read path
(search, MCP, chat) stays default-scoped.

### R3 — Memory-safe bulk ops
`chunkById(100)` / `cursor()` instead of `->get()` + `foreach` for any sweep
that can exceed a few hundred rows. Push filters into SQL. When the filter
list itself is large, split it with `array_chunk($list, 1000)` and apply one
`whereNotIn()` per chunk so each generated `IN` list stays ≤ 1000 values.
The aim is bounded per-clause lists for portability and readable plans, not
bounded total bindings.

### R4 — Never ignore a return value on a side-effecting call
`Storage::put/delete/copy`, `mkdir`, `file_put_contents`, `copy`, `rename`,
HTTP responses — check or wrap. `202 Accepted` after a failed `put()` is the
cardinal sin (PR #5).

### R5 — `action.yml` hygiene
- Serialise file bodies with `jq --rawfile content "$file"`, never `--arg`
  (ARG_MAX + newline stripping).
- Keep the full-sync `find` and the diff `git diff` extension sets in
  lock-step (`.md` + `.markdown`).
- Ingest set: `--diff-filter=AMR`. Delete set: handle both `D` and the `R…`
  old path. A rename must produce one ingest and one delete.

### R6 — Docs/config coupling
When you introduce or rename an env var, update `.env.example`,
`config/*.php`, **and** the README quick-start snippet in the same PR.
Copilot flagged `KB_DISK_DRIVER=s3` drift on PR #4 — the kind of debt that
ages badly.

### R7 — No `@`-silenced errors, no `0777`
`@mkdir($dir, 0777, true)` is out. Use `0755` and propagate errors.

### R8 — Honour `KB_PATH_PREFIX`
`kb:ingest-folder`'s `{path}` argument is resolved **relative to**
`KB_PATH_PREFIX` because the queued job re-applies the prefix on read. New
CLIs/APIs that walk the disk must honour the prefix or explicitly reject
absolute paths. Whichever you pick, document it in the help text and README.

### R9 — Docs must match code
Column names, env vars, config keys, command flags, and routes quoted in
this file (or in `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, any `SKILL.md`) must be copied
from the real source — the migration, the config, the routes file, the
`php artisan <cmd> --help` output. Stale docs are worse than missing docs:
they survive grep and propagate into queries and tests. Copilot caught
`chunk_index` vs `chunk_order` drift on PR #7 — verify before quoting.

### R10 — Canonical awareness
Every query, scope, retrieval step, promotion path, and delete path that
touches `knowledge_documents` or `kb_nodes` / `kb_edges` / `kb_canonical_audit`
MUST handle BOTH states (canonical / non-canonical) deliberately.

Checklist:
1. Use dedicated Eloquent scopes (`canonical()`, `accepted()`, `byType()`,
   `bySlug()`) instead of raw WHERE on canonical columns.
2. `scopeAccepted()` implies `canonical()` — don't re-derive status filters.
3. Tenant-scoped composite FKs on `kb_edges` — cross-tenant edges are
   impossible; FK errors are bugs, not noise.
4. Slug + doc_id are unique PER PROJECT, not globally. Two projects can
   share `dec-cache-v2`.
5. Hard delete cascades via `DocumentDeleter::forceDelete()`; soft delete
   leaves the graph intact.
6. Canonical re-ingest must vacate prior identifiers first (handled by
   `DocumentIngestor::vacateCanonicalIdentifiersOnPreviousVersions()`).
7. `Reranker` applies canonical boost + status penalty; new retrieval
   services honour these knobs or add an ADR.
8. Graph expansion + rejected injection are config-gated.
9. Every canonical mutation writes to `kb_canonical_audit`.
10. Never hard-code global slug uniqueness.

Distilled from the canonical compilation series (PRs #9–#14). See
`.claude/skills/canonical-awareness/`.

### R11 — Frontend testid / ARIA / observable state contract
Every React component under `frontend/src/` exposes stable
`data-testid` values on actionable elements, proper ARIA (`role`,
`aria-label`, `aria-live`), and observable async states
(`data-state="idle|loading|ready|error|empty"`, `aria-busy`).
Validation errors render next to their input with
`data-testid="<field>-error"`. API failures surface in the DOM —
no swallowed `useMutation` failures. See
`.claude/skills/frontend-testid-conventions/`.

### R12 — User-visible UI changes ship Playwright E2E coverage
From PR5 onward, every PR touching `frontend/src/` or a route that
renders into the SPA must include `frontend/e2e/<feature>.spec.ts`
with at least one happy path and one failure path. Selectors use
`getByTestId` or `getByRole` + accessible name. Waits use
`data-state` / `toHaveAttribute`, never `waitForTimeout`. See
`.claude/skills/playwright-e2e/`.

### R13 — E2E scenarios exercise real data; stub only external services
Playwright boots `php artisan serve` with `APP_ENV=testing` via
`playwright.config.ts` webServer block. Tests hit the real DB
(SQLite, reset+seeded via `/testing/reset` + `/testing/seed`).
`page.route(...)` is reserved for external-service boundaries
only — AI providers (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini,
Regolo), email senders, payment rails, remote object storage,
OCR APIs. Intercepting `/api/admin/*`, `/api/kb/*`,
`/api/auth/*`, `/sanctum/csrf-cookie`, `/conversations`, or any
internal route turns E2E into a unit test in E2E clothing. The
only exception is explicit failure injection on an internal
route, which must carry an `R13: failure injection` marker
comment so the intent is auditable.
`scripts/verify-e2e-real-data.sh` is wired into the CI workflow
and fails the build on any unmarked internal interception. See
`.claude/skills/playwright-e2e/` and
`.claude/skills/playwright-e2e-templates/`.

### R14 — Surface failures loudly; never 200 with empty/null/NaN
Empty/null/NaN on 200 is the same bug as silent `put() → false`.
Every endpoint that cannot deliver a valid body maps failure to the
correct status (404 missing, 500 unreadable, 503 downstream outage).
No `""` PDF, no `null` JSON from a caught 500, no `-Infinity` from
`Math.max(...[])`, no chosen-by-message-prefix status code. See
`.claude/skills/surface-failures-loudly/`.

### R15 — Frontend a11y checklist
Every interactive element is programmatically labelled
(`<label htmlFor>` / `aria-label`), keyboard-reachable (no
`display:none` on real inputs — use visually-hidden pattern), with
role/state on the focusable element (not the wrapper). Tooltips
respond to focus/blur, not only mouseenter. See
`.claude/skills/frontend-a11y-checklist/`.

### R16 — Tests actually exercise the behaviour they claim
A test named "enables Save after edit" must simulate an edit AND
assert Save becomes enabled. An ordering test must use
strictly-monotonic fixtures so reversing the endpoint would fail.
Tests that mutate global state (env, DI, `window.location`, `Date.now`)
restore it in `afterEach`. See
`.claude/skills/test-actually-tests-what-it-claims/`.

### R17 — React effects sync imperative / cached state
When an effect owns an imperative cache (CodeMirror `EditorView`,
canvas, ref-of-server-state), every branch that re-reads from the
source must ALSO sync the cache. Optimistic updates stay until
refetch completes. `NaN` is guarded before equality checks.
`.map()` multi-element rows wrap in keyed `<Fragment key>` — NOT
`<>` with key on an inner child. See
`.claude/skills/react-effect-sync-cached-state/`.

### R18 — Derive options from the DB, not from a literal subset
UI filters, project lists, file-extension handling all derive from
the real domain (API endpoint / distinct query / ingest-accepted
extensions), never from a hard-coded sample. See
`.claude/skills/derive-from-db-not-literal/`.

### R19 — Input escaping is complete
Escape every meta-char for every operator: LIKE (`%`, `_`, `\\`),
fnmatch (always pass `FNM_PATHNAME` on paths), regex (escape `.`
when the pattern is a literal host — or use `grep -Fq`), CSV env
vars (`array_filter(array_map('trim', explode(',', $raw)))`). See
`.claude/skills/input-escape-complete/`.

### R20 — Route contracts match the FE payload shape
FE `?token=X` ↔ BE `GET /reset-password` (query), not
`/reset-password/{token}`. E2E specs post the shape the controller
validates (`{ documents.*.project_key + content }`, not
`{ project, markdown }`). TanStack parent routes render `<Outlet />`
or nested children never mount. Artisan wrappers distinguish
positional from option by signature. See
`.claude/skills/route-contracts-match-fe-shape/`.

### R21 — Security invariants are atomic or absent
Lock-read-update-commit live inside the SAME transaction. Single-use
tokens / nonces / rate counters mutate state INSIDE the lock, never
after. Columns that encode "consumed" / "revoked" have DB-level
`UNIQUE` or `PARTIAL UNIQUE` backing where the business rule demands
it. One occurrence mints a rule because the blast radius is
RCE-class. See `.claude/skills/security-invariants-atomic-or-absent/`.

### R22 — CI failure investigation: artefact-first, then code
When `gh pr checks` shows Playwright (or any E2E job) red, NEVER guess
fixes from the test name alone. Always pull the failure context first:

1. **Failed-job log** — `gh run view --job <id> --log-failed` for the
   `✘` lines and the failing spec:line.
2. **Playwright HTML report** — `tests.yml` uploads `playwright-report/`
   on failure (retention 7d). Download via the GitHub UI or
   `gh run download <run-id> --pattern 'playwright-report-shard-*'`
   (the job is sharded, so each shard uploads its own artefact named
   `playwright-report-shard-<n>`; the failed-job log names the shard). Each
   `data/<hash>.md` carries the locator, timeout, page snapshot URL,
   and screenshot path. Read these BEFORE diffing code.
3. **Laravel log tail** — the workflow's "Dump Laravel log on failure"
   step prints the last 200 lines of `storage/logs/laravel.log` inline.
   A 500 from `/api/admin/...` surfaces as a Playwright "element not
   visible" while the real stack trace lives in the laravel log.
4. **Diagnostic throws** — when a non-2xx response masks itself as a
   timeout, add a temporary `waitForResponse` + throw so the next CI
   run prints the real status code + JSON body in the failed-job log.
   Leave them in until green.

A wrong commit costs one CI cycle (4–8 min) AND a misleading next
baseline; artefact reading costs 5 min. PR #33 caught the DemoSeeder
frontmatter regression (slug missing + invalid `type: policy`) this way.
See `.claude/skills/ci-failure-investigation/`.

### R30 — Cross-tenant isolation on every tenant-aware query
Every Eloquent query against a tenant-aware table MUST be scoped to the
active tenant via `forTenant($ctx->current())` (provided by the
`BelongsToTenant` trait) or an explicit `where('tenant_id', ...)`. Two
customers can share the same `project_key` — tenant boundary is the only
safe scope. Tenant-aware tables (authoritative: `TenantIdMandatoryTest::TENANT_AWARE_MODELS`):
`knowledge_documents`, `knowledge_chunks`, `chat_logs`, `conversations`, `messages`,
`kb_nodes`, `kb_edges`, `kb_canonical_audit`, `project_memberships`, `kb_tags`,
`knowledge_document_tags`, `knowledge_document_acl`, `admin_command_audit`,
`admin_command_nonces`, `admin_insights_snapshots`, `chat_filter_presets`.
`embedding_cache` is cross-tenant by design (global `UNIQUE(text_hash, provider, model)`).
See `.claude/skills/cross-tenant-isolation/`.

### R31 — `tenant_id` mandatory on every tenant-aware Model + migration
Every Eloquent model under `app/Models/` representing a tenant-scoped domain
entity MUST `use BelongsToTenant;` and list `'tenant_id'` in `$fillable`
(or `$guarded = ['id']`). Every new migration creating a tenant-aware table
MUST add `string('tenant_id', 50)->default('default')->index()` and start
composite uniques with `tenant_id`. Architecture test
`tests/Architecture/TenantIdMandatoryTest.php` gates new entries.
See `.claude/skills/tenant-id-mandatory/`.

### R36 — Copilot review + CI green loop is MANDATORY after EVERY push
After every commit-push-PR cycle: request Copilot review with
`--reviewer copilot-pull-request-reviewer` on PR creation; wait for CI
green; wait for Copilot review comments; fix any must-fix findings; repeat.
Merge only when BOTH `reviewDecision = APPROVED` (or zero outstanding
must-fix) AND all CI checks `COMPLETED + SUCCESS`. Green CI alone is not
enough. Applies to all repos under `lopadova/*` and `padosoft/*`.

**Review-provider fallback (2026-06-14): Copilot first, Codex on
out-of-budget.** When Copilot is out of budget for a prolonged period
(HTTP 402 on the copilot-cli critic AND no cloud review fires after
requesting), auto-switch to the **ChatGPT Codex connector**: post a PR
comment `@codex review` (`gh pr comment <N> --body "@codex review"`) — the
`chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]` then reviews like Copilot; re-comment
`@codex review` after each fix. Run the same loop until 0 must-fix. An
independent code-reviewer SUBAGENT stays as the always-on local pre-merge
gate when both cloud bots are unavailable. See `CLAUDE.md` R36 +
`.claude/skills/copilot-pr-review-loop/`.

### R37 — Branching: `feature/vX.Y` integration branches → `main` once per release
For AskMyDocs: `main` = stable production. Each major release works in its
own `feature/vX.Y` branch. Sub-task branches target `feature/vX.Y`, not
`main`. Merge to `main` happens ONCE per major release when all sub-branches
are merged, all tests + CI are green, and RC acceptance gates pass — then
`feature/vX.Y → main → tag vX.Y.0`. For new standalone `padosoft/*` repos,
PRs target `main` directly. See `.claude/skills/branching-strategy-feature-vx/`.

### R38 — Heavy work belongs in CLI workflow steps, not behind `php artisan serve`
PHP's built-in dev server has a single-threaded accept loop; any
multi-second blocking task (e.g. `migrate:fresh`, large seeders) stalls the
loop and causes ECONNREFUSED on subsequent requests. Move one-time heavy
work to a dedicated CLI step BEFORE Playwright starts. Reserve `/testing/reset`
and `/testing/seed` for per-test lightweight seeding (not full migrations).
See `.claude/skills/ci-failure-investigation/` (R22/R38 worked example:
PR #85 vs PR #83 anti-pattern).

### R39 — Tag `vX.Y.0-rcN` at the end of every Wn milestone
After each Wn closure on `feature/vX.Y` (all sub-task PRs merged + CI green
+ closure status doc shipped): (1) open a docs PR refreshing `README.md`
`### Key Features` and `## Changelog`; (2) capture the closure-commit SHA
before the docs PR merges; (3) tag at that exact SHA with
`gh release create vX.Y.0-rcN --target "$CLOSURE_SHA" --prerelease`.
Increment N once per Wn. Final `vX.Y.0` GA fires only when the last Wn
closes and `feature/vX.Y` merges into `main` (R37).
See `.claude/skills/rc-tag-per-week-milestone/`.

### R40 — Local critic loop (copilot-cli) BEFORE every push (v8.0+)

Standing convention from **2026-05-18**. Every push from this point
forward MUST run a local copilot-cli pre-flight review BEFORE the
push leaves the laptop. The R36 cloud loop stays mandatory but
should converge in 1-2 rounds instead of 5-15.

Mandatory workflow per sub-PR:
1. Local tests green (`vendor/bin/phpunit` + targeted suites).
2. Settle the working tree (stop editing, save buffers, run
   tests once more so phpunit confirms the WIP compiles +
   behaves). Working tree may stay uncommitted — copilot-cli
   reads via `git diff HEAD` plus direct file reads — but MUST
   NOT be mid-edit.
3. `copilot --autopilot --yolo --add-dir "$(pwd)" -p "/review ..."`
   on the settled diff — `/review` is the built-in slash command
   (`copilot help commands` lists it) and is invocable as the
   first line of `-p`. Pass the actual diff and PR metadata via
   files so the agent reviews real hunks, not a re-derivation
   from `git log`:
   ```bash
   git diff "origin/${BASE_BRANCH}...HEAD" >/tmp/pr-diff.patch
   gh pr view --json title,body >/tmp/pr-meta.json
   ```
   Then point the prompt at those files plus
   `.github/instructions/r-rules.instructions.md` (path-scoped
   R-rule subset, auto-loaded by Copilot CLI). End the prompt
   with a directive asking for `SUMMARY: <N> must-fix, <M> nit`
   on the last line so the wrapper can parse it.
4. Fix every must-fix + should-fix locally; re-run tests.
5. Re-run copilot-cli; loop until `0 must-fix, 0 should-fix`.

Canonical wrapper: `scripts/local-critic-loop.sh [base-branch]`
encodes the full pattern (diff capture, meta capture, prompt
assembly, `/review` invocation, SUMMARY parsing). Exits non-zero
when `N > 0` so the wrapper is usable as a `pre-push` git hook.
6. Only then push; first push opens the PR with
   `--reviewer copilot-pull-request-reviewer` per R36; subsequent
   pushes re-request the review.
7. R36 cloud loop runs on the already-clean diff; expect 0-1 round
   of GitHub Copilot findings, rarely 2.

Anti-patterns:
- ❌ Push first, then run copilot-cli on the cloud-mirrored branch
  (defeats the wall-time saving).
- ❌ Skip copilot-cli because the diff is small.
- ❌ Accept copilot-cli findings without fix and push regardless.
- ❌ Run copilot-cli mid-edit on an in-flux working tree (half-
  typed methods, broken syntax, unsaved buffers) — settle first,
  then review.

Scope: every PR on `lopadova/AskMyDocs` from 2026-05-18 onward and
every PR on `padosoft/*` (current + future). Applies to docs-only
PRs and CI-fix PRs too.

See full rule in `CLAUDE.md` R40 (load-bearing canonical version).

### R44 — Every capability is tri-surface: PHP + HTTP API + MCP, over ONE core

Iron rule, standing from **2026-06-13**. Every feature/capability we
introduce — and every later modification of an existing one — MUST be
exposed AND consumable across **all three** surfaces, built as thin
layers over **ONE shared core service** (never three parallel
implementations):

1. **PHP** — an Artisan command and/or service/facade callable from app code.
2. **HTTP API** — a RESTful endpoint, auth + RBAC-gated, with an R32
   authorization-matrix row.
3. **MCP** — a `Laravel\Mcp\Server\Tool` registered on
   `KnowledgeBaseServer::$tools` (+ bump the registration-count test).

A capability that lands on only one or two surfaces is a **gap, not a
smaller feature** — close it in the same PR or file the follow-up. When
you MODIFY a capability (new field, option, contract change), propagate
to all three surfaces + their tests in the same PR so they never drift.
Each surface is tested at its layer (service PHPUnit + HTTP feature test
+ MCP registration/contract test); UI surfaces add Vitest + Playwright.
Intrinsically single-surface capabilities (e.g. a scheduler-only sweep
with no caller-facing read) state WHY in the PR — a documented choice,
never an omission. See full rule in `CLAUDE.md` R44.

### R45 — Doc-site parity: every feature/release/README change ships its Mintlify deep-doc

The public docs live under **`/docs-site/`** (Mintlify, groups-based, deployed to
`padosoft.mintlify.app`), separate from the internal `/docs/`. A PR that adds or
changes a capability — or edits `README.md` feature tables / changelog / roadmap —
MUST also add/update the corresponding **deep standalone page** under
`/docs-site/` and register it in `docs.json`. The doc-site is authored at
senior-architect / academic depth (motivation → theory → design with a Mermaid
diagram → data model → ADR-style rationale linking `/docs/adr/*` → worked example
→ gotchas), NOT a condensed README paste. `docs.json` must be valid JSON with a
file for every nav entry. A README bump with no doc-site page is an incomplete PR.
See full rule in `CLAUDE.md` R45 + `.claude/skills/mintlify-doc-authoring/`.

### R46 — Deferred-E2E fast loop: run Playwright LAST, never inside the Copilot rounds

Standing from 2026-06-22 (Lorenzo). Playwright E2E (~18-20 min) is the most
expensive gate, and Copilot reviews the diff — not E2E results — so E2E never
runs inside the test/CI/Copilot rounds. Per-PR order:

1. Implement.
2. Local unit gate FAST only: PHPUnit + Vitest (`npm test` + `npm run
   test:legacy`). No Playwright. Fix until green.
3. Local copilot-cli loop (R40) until `0 must-fix` — between rounds re-run only
   php+vite.
4. Local Playwright (`npm run e2e`). Fix until green. No Copilot for spec-only
   fixes — but re-run the local copilot-cli loop (R40) if an E2E fix touches
   non-trivial app code.
5. Open PR. CI runs unit-only; the `playwright` job is gated OFF (no `run-e2e`
   label). Fix until php+vite CI green.
6. Cloud Copilot loop (R36) until `0 outstanding must-fix` — CI still php+vite
   only.
7. Final gate: `gh pr edit <N> --add-label run-e2e` → the `labeled` event
   re-fires CI and the gated Playwright job runs. Fix until green. No Copilot
   for E2E-only fixes.
8. Merge when BOTH: 0 Copilot must-fix AND all CI green (incl. the labelled
   E2E run).

**md-only exception:** a diff touching only `.md` files engages **no** Copilot
(skip local copilot-cli AND cloud Copilot). `.mdx` doc-site pages are NOT
covered — they ship with feature code (R45) and follow the normal flow.

CI: `tests.yml` gates `playwright` behind
`(push to main) || contains(labels, 'run-e2e')`, with `pull_request` types
including `labeled`. See full rule in `CLAUDE.md` R46 +
`.claude/skills/copilot-pr-review-loop/`.

## Security rule catalogue — Lorenzo security experience

Canonical rules: `.claude/rules/rule-security-*.md`. Auto-loaded review mirrors:
`.github/instructions/security-*.instructions.md`. For AI/RAG/MCP/provider/widget
or model-rendering changes, enforce `SEC-LLM-001` and `SEC-AI-ACT-001` using the
`secure-ai-surface` skill.

Review the effective population, including SDK, direct HTTP, stream, fallback,
queue, MCP and widget paths. Provider/model policy, PII, budget, audit, immutable
initiating identity, idempotency and safe rendering must cover every path. Prompts
and tenant/admin settings are not security boundaries; unknown policy fails closed.

Mapping and infrastructure residuals:
`docs/security/LORENZO_SECURITY_EXPERIENCE.md`. Rule/skill/mirror changes must
pass `npm run security:rules`.

---

## 7. Testing & CI

- `vendor/bin/phpunit` — SQLite in-memory, migrations under
  `tests/database/migrations/` (swap `vector(N)` for JSON text).
- `npm test` — Vitest against `resources/js/*.mjs`.
- CI: `.github/workflows/tests.yml` on push to `main` and on PRs.
- `Storage::fake('kb')` is the standard pattern for exercising ingestion.
- `AiManager` is deliberately non-`final` so Mockery can swap it in tests.
- Any PR touching retrieval/ingestion/deletion must add a **feature** test
  (not just a unit test).

---

## 8. Style / scope

- Prefer editing existing files. The repo already centralises path
  normalisation (`KbPath`), deletion (`DocumentDeleter`), ingestion
  (`DocumentIngestor`) — plug into those instead of cloning logic.
- Don't ship dead compatibility shims or "just in case" abstractions.
- Keep the README, `.env.example`, and `config/*.php` in sync.
- Commits go on the designated feature branch; never force-push `main`.

---

## 9. Copilot review checklist

Before approving a PR, quickly verify:

- [ ] R1: every new `source_path` / `path` consumer calls
      `KbPath::normalize()` (grep for `trim(` / `str_replace('\\'` / inline
      `preg_replace('#/+#'`).
- [ ] R2: every query on `KnowledgeDocument` that handles `--force` or
      retention uses `withTrashed()` / `onlyTrashed()`.
- [ ] R3: every new sweep uses `chunkById()` / `cursor()` and pushes filters
      into SQL.
- [ ] R4: every `Storage::put/delete`, `mkdir`, `file_put_contents` has its
      return value checked or is inside a method that throws on failure.
- [ ] R5: `action.yml` edits keep `jq --rawfile`, lock-step extensions,
      `AMR` / `D+R` filters.
- [ ] R6: env-var additions touch `.env.example` + `config/*.php` + README
      in the same diff.
- [ ] R7: no `@`-silenced calls, no `0777`.
- [ ] R8: any disk walker is explicit about `KB_PATH_PREFIX` handling.
- [ ] R9: every column / env / flag / route quoted in the diff exists in
      the migration / config / routes / `--help` output it claims to mirror.
- [ ] R10: every query on the KB graph uses the canonical scopes
      (`canonical()` / `accepted()` / `raw()` / `byType()` / `bySlug()`),
      no bare `where('project_key', …)` for retrieval grounding.
- [ ] R11: every new FE actionable element has `data-testid` + ARIA +
      `data-state` on the async container.
- [ ] R12: every UI-touching PR ships ≥ 1 happy + ≥ 1 failure Playwright
      spec.
- [ ] R13: `bash scripts/verify-e2e-real-data.sh` exits 0.
- [ ] R14: no endpoint returns 200 on error; no `""` / `null` / NaN
      leaks through a successful body.
- [ ] R15: every new input has a label; no `display:none` on real inputs;
      role/state on the focusable element.
- [ ] R16: every test's body matches its name (ordering tests use
      strictly-monotonic fixtures; failure tests actually fire failure).
- [ ] R17: React effects that re-read server state sync any imperative
      cache in the same branch; `.map()` of multi-element rows wraps in
      `<Fragment key>`.
- [ ] R18: UI dropdowns derive from the DB / API, not a hard-coded
      subset; file-extension handling covers `.md` AND `.markdown`.
- [ ] R19: LIKE escapes `%` + `_` + `\\`; fnmatch passes `FNM_PATHNAME`;
      regex literals escape `.`; CSV env vars go through trim + filter.
- [ ] R20: FE call-site shape matches BE validator shape; TanStack
      parent routes render `<Outlet />`; Artisan wrappers respect
      positional vs option signatures.
- [ ] R21: `lockForUpdate()` + `update()` live in the SAME
      `DB::transaction`; single-use resources have DB-level unique
      backing; concurrency-sensitive services have a concurrent test.
- [ ] R30: every query on a tenant-aware table uses `forTenant()` or
      explicit `where('tenant_id', ...)`.
- [ ] R31: every new tenant-scoped Model uses `BelongsToTenant` and lists
      `tenant_id` in `$fillable`; new migration adds `tenant_id` column.
- [ ] R36: PR was opened with `--reviewer copilot-pull-request-reviewer`;
      merge blocked until CI green AND Copilot review resolved.
- [ ] R37: sub-task PRs target `feature/vX.Y`, not `main`; `main` merge
      happens once per major release only.
- [ ] R38: one-time heavy CLI work (migrate:fresh, large seeders) runs in
      a dedicated workflow step, not behind `php artisan serve`.
- [ ] R39: Wn closure tagged `vX.Y.0-rcN` at the exact closure-commit SHA
      with a refreshed README + CHANGELOG entry.
- [ ] Tests: feature test added when the RAG hot path changed.
