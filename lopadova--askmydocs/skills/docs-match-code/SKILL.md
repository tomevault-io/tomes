# Docs match code

## Rule

Anything in a doc that names a real artifact — a column, an env var, a
config key, a command flag, a route, a signature — must be **verified
against the source** before commit. Stale docs are worse than missing docs:
they lie with authority and survive grep.

Specifically, before editing:

- A schema description → open the matching migration in
  `database/migrations/` (and the test mirror under
  `tests/database/migrations/`) and copy the column names verbatim.
- An env var listing → open `.env.example` AND `config/<area>.php` and
  cross-check the key name + default.
- A command signature → run `php artisan <command> --help` (or read
  `protected $signature` in the command class).
- An API route → open `routes/api.php` / `routes/web.php`.
- A non-trivial code snippet → load the referenced class and confirm the
  method exists with that signature.

## Why this exists

Copilot flagged on PR #7 that the `knowledge_chunks` schema in `CLAUDE.md`
named a `chunk_index` column and omitted `chunk_hash`. The actual migration
ships `chunk_order`, `chunk_hash`, plus `project_key` and `metadata`. The
`knowledge_documents` summary was similarly partial. Both errors would have
been caught by a 30-second look at
`database/migrations/2026_01_01_000002_create_knowledge_chunks_table.php`.

A wrong schema in `CLAUDE.md` is load-bearing damage: future PRs use the
file as a quick-reference and silently propagate the mistake into queries,
tests, and follow-up docs.

## Patterns

### Cross-check a schema before quoting it

```bash
# Bash one-liner: list every column the migration actually creates
php artisan tinker --execute="echo collect(Schema::getColumnListing('knowledge_chunks'))->implode(', ');"

# …or just grep the migration:
grep -E "\\\$table->" database/migrations/*knowledge_chunks*
```

Then write the doc against that output, not from memory.

### Cross-check an env var

```bash
grep '^KB_' .env.example                    # env names + comments
grep -RIn 'config(.kb' app/ config/         # who reads them
grep -RIn 'env(.KB_' config/                # default chain
```

The README quick-start, `.env.example`, and `config/kb.php` must agree on
the **same** key name with the **same** default. If they don't, fix all
three in the same diff (this is also rule R6).

### Cross-check an Artisan signature

```bash
php artisan kb:ingest-folder --help
```

Copy the signature/options from the help output, not from a half-remembered
PR description.

## Checklist before opening a PR that touches docs

- [ ] Every column name quoted in `CLAUDE.md` /
      `.github/copilot-instructions.md` matches a `$table->` line in the
      corresponding migration.
- [ ] Every env var quoted matches `.env.example` AND the `env('…')` call
      in `config/*.php`.
- [ ] Every command name + flag matches `php artisan <command> --help`.
- [ ] Every route path matches `routes/api.php` / `routes/web.php`.
- [ ] Every class / method referenced in a code snippet actually exists
      (open it; do not paste from memory).
- [ ] When you rename a column, env var, config key, command flag, or
      route, grep the docs and update every mention in the same commit.

## Counter-example

```markdown
### `knowledge_chunks`
`id`, `knowledge_document_id` FK, `chunk_index`, `chunk_text`,
`heading_path`, `embedding vector(N)`.
```

The actual migration creates `chunk_order` (not `chunk_index`) and a
`chunk_hash` column the doc forgot. Anyone writing a query off this doc
will get a "column does not exist" error.

## Correct example

```markdown
### `knowledge_chunks`
`id`, `knowledge_document_id` FK (ON DELETE CASCADE), `project_key`,
`chunk_order`, `chunk_hash` (SHA-256), `heading_path`, `chunk_text`,
`metadata` JSON, `embedding vector(N)`. UNIQUE
`(knowledge_document_id, chunk_hash)`.
```

Each column name copied straight from
`database/migrations/2026_01_01_000002_create_knowledge_chunks_table.php`.

## Extension: comment-drift + PROGRESS.md drift + docblock/impl drift

Distilled from the PR16 live re-harvest — 22 `doc-drift` findings
across PRs #16–#31. The migration-filename / column-rename drift the
original skill covered is half of the story. The other half is
**in-repo commentary drifting from code**: block comments atop a
component that no longer reflects its tab set, PROGRESS.md checklists
referencing filenames that do not exist, docblocks claiming "encrypted
+ sha256" token derivation when the impl is plain random + sha256,
config comments that say `TTL=0 disables` when the impl treats
`TTL=0` as "no expiry".

### Symptom classes

1. **Block comment vs impl** — the top-of-file comment lists tabs /
   props / behaviours that no longer match.
   - PR #26 `DocumentDetail.tsx` + `KbView.tsx`: block comment said
     "Preview/Meta/History only"; Source tab had been added.
   - PR #30 `MetaTab.tsx`: block comment said "renders nothing while
     loading"; impl renders explicit loading + error UIs.
2. **PROGRESS.md row drift** — the checklist claims filenames, PR
   numbers, test counts that don't line up with reality.
   - PR #23 PROGRESS: references a migration filename that doesn't
     exist.
   - PR #24 PROGRESS: G1 row "branch parent = PR7" but the checklist
     below is titled "PR8 — Phase G1".
   - PR #29 PROGRESS: migration filenames without timestamp prefix.
   - PR #30 PROGRESS: claims "4 new Playwright scenarios" while
     enumerating 6.
3. **Docblock vs impl** — the `/** */` over a class / method
   misrepresents the real contract.
   - PR #17 `LoginRequest::throttleKey()`: docblock says "hashing
     email" but impl only lower-cases.
   - PR #23 `UserStoreRequest`: docblock says email uniqueness spans
     "live + trashed"; rule scopes to `whereNull('deleted_at')`.
   - PR #29 `config/admin.php`: docblock says tokens are
     `Crypt::encryptString + sha256 nonce`; impl is plain random +
     `sha256($token)`. Same PR's migration docblock mismatches too.
4. **Migration filename drift** — docs reference a migration that
   doesn't exist or uses a different date prefix than the filesystem.
5. **Table name drift** — LESSONS.md / CLAUDE.md quotes
   `admin_command_audits` (plural) while migration creates
   `admin_command_audit` (singular). PR #29.
6. **Env-var comment drift** — `env.example` comment describes
   defaulting to `false` when the config actually defaults to `true`.

### Detection recipes

```bash
# PROGRESS.md filename claims vs real files
rg -n 'database/migrations/[0-9_]+_[a-z_]+\.php' docs/enhancement-plan/PROGRESS.md \
  | while IFS=: read -r file line quoted; do
      [[ -f "$quoted" ]] || echo "MISSING: $quoted (line $line)"
    done

# Block-comment-vs-impl drift
# Find components with a block comment at top and a `VALID_TABS` / tab-set const
rg -n --multiline '^/\*\*[\s\S]*?\*/\s*\n[\s\S]*?VALID_TABS' frontend/src/

# Table-name drift
rg -n "admin_command_audits|admin_command_audit" docs/ CLAUDE.md .github/

# Docblock claim grep
rg -n "sha256|encrypt|hash" app/Services/ -B 1 -A 2 | rg -C2 '/\*\*|//'
```

### Fix template — keep docs + impl in lock-step in the SAME PR

When you change:

| Source | Docs that reference it |
|---|---|
| `database/migrations/*` (new / rename) | `CLAUDE.md §4`, `README.md` quick-start, `docs/enhancement-plan/PROGRESS.md` checklist |
| `protected $signature` on an Artisan command | `CLAUDE.md §5 Scheduler`, `README.md` command list, `.env.example` comment for any knob |
| `config/<area>.php` default | `.env.example`, `README.md` "Configuration" section, any SKILL.md that cites the default |
| Block comment atop a component | Component code itself; if you add a tab, remove / update the comment in the same commit |
| Class docblock `/** */` | Impl must match; grep the docblock claims (`hash`, `encrypt`, `sha256`, `never`, `always`) against the body |

### PROGRESS.md row drift — the hardest to catch

Add a git-pre-commit hook in the agent-dispatch briefing: every time
the PR row in PROGRESS.md is edited, the agent must run
`rg 'database/migrations/[a-z0-9_/]+\.php' PROGRESS.md` and check
each referenced path with `test -f`. Failing to ship this check is
exactly why PR #23 / #29 / #30 each landed with a filename drift.

### Pre-PR checklist — extended

- [ ] Every column / env / flag / route / filename quoted in a doc
      was copied from the source of truth this diff modifies.
- [ ] Every block comment atop a modified component matches the
      component's current surface (tab set, prop list, behaviour).
- [ ] Every docblock (`/** */`) over a modified method matches the
      method body.
- [ ] PROGRESS.md filenames `test -f` clean.
- [ ] LESSONS.md table / column / env names match migration output.
- [ ] Counts (tests, scenarios, routes) match `vendor/bin/phpunit
      --list-tests | wc -l`, `npx playwright test --list | wc -l`.
