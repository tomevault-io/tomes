# PM Brain Workflow Assistant

This skill helps you navigate and apply product management frameworks from the PM Brain repository following a natural product development flow.

## Core Principle: Think First, Template Later

Before jumping to templates, help users:
1. **Braindump** - Get all raw thoughts out
2. **Structure thinking** - Use framework prompts to organize
3. **Template** - Only then apply formal templates

## Framework Flow

The PM Brain follows a natural product development sequence:

```
2.0 Foundations → 2.1 Strategy → 2.2 Discovery → 2.3 Execution → 2.4 Communication
(HOW TO THINK)  (WHERE TO GO?)  (WHAT TO BUILD?) (BUILD & SHIP)  (KEEP ALIGNED)
```

**When user is:**
- Early/exploring → Point to **2.0 Foundations** and **2.1 Strategy**
- Has a problem → Guide to **2.2 Discovery**
- Ready to build → Move to **2.3 Execution**
- Throughout → Support with **2.4 Communication**

## Quick Framework Locations

### 2.0 Foundations (How to Think)
- Mental Models: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/`
- Bias Awareness: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.2-Bias/`
- Self-Reflection: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.3-Self-Reflection/`

### 2.1 Strategy (Where are we going?)
- Strategic Foundations: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.1-Strategy/2.1.1-Strategic-Foundations/`
- OKRs: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.1-Strategy/2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/1-OKR/`
- Roadmaps: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.1-Strategy/2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/2-Roadmap/`
- North Star: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.1-Strategy/2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/3-North-Star/`
- Prioritization: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.1-Strategy/2.1.2-Strategic-Execution/4-Prioritization/`

### 2.2 Discovery (What to build?)
- Research Interviews: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/2.2.1-Research-Interviews/`
- Continuous Discovery: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/2.2.2-Continuous-Discovery-Habits/`
- Jobs-to-be-Done: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/2.2.3-Jobs-To-Be-Done/`
- Opportunity Assessment: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/2.2.4-Opportunity-Assessment/`
- Problem-Solution Space: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.2-Discovery/2.2.6-Problem-Solution-Space/`

### 2.3 Execution (Build, ship, measure)
- Daily Rituals: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Execution/2.3.1-Daily-Execution-And-Rituals/`
- User Stories: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Execution/2.3.2-User-Stories/`
- PRDs: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Execution/2.3.4-PRD/`
- Personas: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Execution/2.3.5-Personas/`
- Metrics: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Execution/2.3.6-Metrics/`

### 2.4 Communication (Keep aligned)
- Newsletters: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.4-Communication/2.4.1-Newsletter/`
- One-Pagers: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.4-Communication/2.4.3-One-Pagers/`
- Stakeholder Management: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.4-Communication/2.4.7-Stakeholder-Management/`
- Saying No: `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.4-Communication/2.4.6-Saying-No/`
- Politics & organization survival: use the `politics-coach` skill with `01-Company-Context/1.1-Stakeholder-Avatars/` (person-level avatars) and `01-Company-Context/1.2-Organization-Survival/` (system-level politics: power map, alliances, red flags) when stakeholder problems are clearly political, not just about message shape.

## Typical File Patterns

Most framework folders follow this structure:
- `1-*-framework.md` - Guide explaining the framework
- `2-*-template.md` - Template to fill out
- `3-*-evaluation.md` - Assessment criteria

## Braindumping Workflow

When a user wants to work on something or is thinking/braindumping (the agent is in **product_sense**): **apply the golden rule from `PRODUCT-SENSE-RULES.md`** (braindump before structure), including the "braindump sufficient" checklist. Use prompts from `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.0-Foundations/2.0.1-Mental-Models/6-Product-Sense-Development/2-product-sense-prompts.md` for the relevant context (PRD, prioritization, strategy, research, stuck).

1. **Listen and probe**
   - Ask if the user has added (or should add) relevant context from [01-Company-Context/](../../../../01-Company-Context/README.md), [03-Research-Artifacts/](../../../../03-Research-Artifacts/README.md), or [04-Initiatives/](../../../../04-Initiatives/README.md); having it in the conversation speeds up thinking.
   - What's the core problem or opportunity?
   - What stage are they at? (ideation, validation, building, shipping)
   - What constraints exist?

2. **Guide exploration** (do not suggest templates yet)
   - Use prompts from `2-product-sense-prompts.md` to surface assumptions and blind spots
   - Ask clarifying questions from the relevant framework
   - Help organize scattered thoughts only after raw thinking is out

3. **Suggest framework** (only after braindump / when leaving product_sense into execution_mode)
   - Match their need to the right framework location
   - Show the framework guide first (1-*-framework.md)
   - Only then point to the template (2-*-template.md)

## Modes & evals

- **product_sense** → braindump, prompts, no framework until sufficient. **execution_mode** → structure + framework/template (or template-finder path). **meta_reflection** → after substantial conversations: suggest `00-Meta/` (log, forecast, learning), optionally Level 2 checklist ([.cursor/evals/](../../../../.cursor/evals/README.md)), and rule updates (`.cursor/rules/thinking.mdc`). Full routing and states: [ORCHESTRATION.md](../../../../ORCHESTRATION.md).
- **Signal mode transitions** in natural language when switching (per [AGENTS.md](../../../../AGENTS.md) and [ORCHESTRATION.md](../../../../ORCHESTRATION.md)); e.g. "We've got enough to structure this—here's the framework that fits…"
- **Evals** are a separate workflow, not a conversation mode: Level 1 (artifact quality) lives in `02-Methods-and-Tools/` and the agent uses Quick Quality Checks per `.cursor/rules/evaluation-orchestration.mdc` when creating supported frameworks; Level 2 (agent behavior) lives in [.cursor/evals/](../../../../.cursor/evals/README.md). See ORCHESTRATION.md → Eval Checkpoints. You may suggest the Level 2 checklist in meta_reflection; the user runs evals when they choose.

## Common Scenarios

### "I have an idea"
→ Start with **Discovery** (use `discovery-research` skill):
- Problem-Solution Space to separate problem from solution
- Jobs-to-be-Done to understand user needs
- Opportunity Assessment to evaluate viability

### "I need to prioritize features"
→ Go to **Strategy** (use `strategy-planning` skill):
- Prioritization frameworks (RICE, Value/Effort, MoSCoW)
- Strategic Foundations for alignment with goals

### "I need to write a PRD"
→ Check in **Execution**:
- Before touching templates, ask **2–3 lightweight preflight questions** (why this/why now, know vs guess, who it’s for) and a **context/memory check**, for example:
  - "Why this, why now?"
  - "What do you already know vs what are you guessing?"
  - "Who is this primarily for to read and approve?"
  - "Do you want to anchor this in any existing strategy/initiative/research, or keep this PRD self-contained for now?"
- PRD templates and guides
- User Stories for requirements
- Metrics for success criteria

### "How do I convince stakeholders?"
→ Look in **Communication** (use `stakeholder-management` skill; add `politics-coach` when dynamics are clearly political):
- One-Pagers for executive summaries
- Stakeholder Management strategies
- Saying No frameworks for managing requests

### "I'm stuck / not sure how to think about this"
→ Start with **Foundations**:
- Mental Models for frameworks
- Bias awareness for blind spots
- Self-Reflection for clarity

### "I'm overwhelmed with requests"
→ Treat this as an **overwhelm / paralysis** case:
- First, acknowledge the feeling and keep cognitive load low.
- Ask **at most 1–2 gentle questions** to narrow, for example: "What’s one thing that, if you made a bit of progress on it this week, would make you feel less stuck?"
- Help the user choose a **tiny, concrete next step** (e.g. "open the first onboarding email and jot 3 bullets on what feels off") instead of introducing mini‑frameworks.
- Make explicit that **they choose**: "You choose the smallest step that feels doable; I’ll help you shape it."

### "Am I improving? / How do I track my judgment?"
→ Point to **00-Meta**:
- **Product Judgment Test**: `00-Meta/0.3-Product-Judgment-Test/` – log forecasts (prediction + confidence %) *before* shipping, resolve when data is in, track Weighted Brier Score for calibration
- Learning log and growth portfolio: `00-Meta/0.1-Learning-Log/`, `00-Meta/0.2-Growth-Portfolio/`

## Response Guidelines

1. **Always cite source paths** - e.g., "From `02-Methods-and-Tools/2.3-Execution/2.3.4-PRD/2-prd-template.md`"

2. **Read files before suggesting** - Don't guess what's in a framework; read it first

3. **Think → Structure → Template** - Never jump straight to templates

4. **Follow the flow** - Respect the natural progression (Foundations → Strategy → Discovery → Execution → Communication)

5. **Cross-reference related frameworks** - PMs benefit from connecting concepts

6. **Be actionable** - Point to specific next steps, not just information

## Storage Locations

- **Personal practice & evidence**: `00-Meta/` (daily log, learning log, growth portfolio, Product Judgment Test)
- **Company context**: `01-Company-Context/`
- **Methods & frameworks**: `02-Methods-and-Tools/`
- **Research artifacts**: `03-Research-Artifacts/`
- **Active initiatives**: `04-Initiatives/`

## Example Interactions

**User:** "I want to assess if we should build a new feature"
**Response:**
1. Ask: What problem does it solve? For whom?
2. Guide to: `2.2-Discovery/2.2.4-Opportunity-Assessment/`
3. Read framework guide first, then suggest template
4. Cross-reference: Problem-Solution Space, JTBD

**User:** "Help me write a PRD"
**Response:**
1. Before template, ask: What have you learned from discovery? What metrics matter?
2. Point to: `2.3-Execution/2.3.4-PRD/`
3. Also reference: User Stories, Personas, Metrics

**User:** "I'm overwhelmed with requests"
**Response:**
1. Explore the situation
2. Point to: `2.4-Communication/2.4.6-Saying-No/`
3. Cross-reference: Prioritization frameworks, Stakeholder Management

## Notes

- This repository is git-versioned - changes are tracked
- Templates are starting points, not rigid requirements
- Frameworks are tools for thinking, not bureaucracy
- The best PMs adapt frameworks to their context
