# Gemini TTS (via OpenRouter)

## When this is loaded

The user picked **Gemini 3.8 Flash TTS** in Flow A step 1 (see [voiceover.md](../../voiceover.md#flow-a-ai-generation)). This reference covers the OpenRouter API key setup and the TTS request. One OpenRouter key covers both TTS and the speech-to-text (STT) pass in [retime.md](../retime.md).

- **Model:** `google/gemini-3.8-flash-tts` (Google's current TTS model; replaces `gemini-3.1-flash-tts-preview`).
- **Voice:** from the [Gemini voice catalog](../../voiceover.md#gemini-voices). Default: **Charon**.
- **Cost:** about $0.01-0.02 per minute of audio. STT adds less than $0.001 per minute. Current prices: https://openrouter.ai/google/gemini-3.8-flash-tts
- **No word timestamps.** Gemini returns audio only. The retime step gets word timings from STT.

## Step 1: Get the API key

Skip this step if `.env` already has `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (check with `grep -c '^OPENROUTER_API_KEY=' .env` -- do not print the value).

Guide the user:

> **Creating your OpenRouter API key:**
>
> 1. Go to https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys (sign in or create an account).
> 2. Add credits at https://openrouter.ai/settings/credits if your balance is zero. $5 covers hundreds of voiceover takes.
> 3. Click **Create API Key** and name it (e.g., "videowright").
> 4. **Set a credit limit** on the key (for example, $5). This caps what the agent can spend with the key.
> 5. Copy the key.

**Storage rules -- do NOT paste the key into chat:**

> **Important:** Do not paste your API key into this chat -- it would be sent to the LLM provider.
>
> Instead:
> 1. Create a `.env` file at your project root (if it doesn't already exist).
> 2. Add this line: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-key-here`
> 3. Make sure `.env` is in your `.gitignore` (add it if not).

Before the first generation, tell the user that the agent will spend OpenRouter credits (a few cents per take).

## Step 2: Write `generate.sh`

Write a script into the voiceover folder so the take can be regenerated. It sends the provider script text (each `[[pause]]` marker turned into a `<long pause>` tag by `retime.mjs text`) and writes `raw.mp3`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Gemini 3.8 Flash TTS via OpenRouter. Run from the project root.
set -euo pipefail
set -a; . ./.env; set +a

VO_DIR="videos/<video>/audio/originals/voiceovers/<slug>"
VOICE="Charon"
STYLE="confident, warm tech explainer; conversational, natural pace"
RAW="$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/gemini_tts.XXXXXX")"

TEXT="$(node node_modules/videowright/skill/scripts/retime.mjs text "$VO_DIR/provider_script.md" \
  --pause-tag "<long pause>")"
[ -n "$TEXT" ] || { echo "ERROR: no text from provider_script.md" >&2; exit 1; }

HTTP_CODE=$(curl -sS -w "%{http_code}" -o "$RAW" https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$(jq -n --arg text "$TEXT" --arg voice "$VOICE" --arg style "$STYLE" '{
    model: "google/gemini-3.8-flash-tts",
    input: $text,
    voice: $voice,
    response_format: "pcm",
    provider: { options: { "google-ai-studio": { speech_metadata: { style: $style } } } }
  }')")

if [ "$HTTP_CODE" != "200" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: OpenRouter returned HTTP $HTTP_CODE" >&2; head -c 800 "$RAW" >&2; echo >&2
  rm -f "$RAW"; exit 1
fi

# OpenRouter returns raw 16-bit PCM, 24 kHz, mono. Accept a WAV header too, in case it is added.
if [ "$(head -c 4 "$RAW")" = "RIFF" ]; then
  ffmpeg -loglevel error -y -i "$RAW" -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 192k "$VO_DIR/raw.mp3"
else
  ffmpeg -loglevel error -y -f s16le -ar 24000 -ac 1 -i "$RAW" -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 192k "$VO_DIR/raw.mp3"
fi
rm -f "$RAW"
echo "Wrote $VO_DIR/raw.mp3 ($(ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration -of csv=p=0 "$VO_DIR/raw.mp3")s)"
```

Request notes:

- `response_format` must be `"pcm"`. Gemini on OpenRouter rejects `"mp3"` with HTTP 400.
- The style goes in `provider.options["google-ai-studio"].speech_metadata.style`. **Never put directions in `input`** -- Gemini 3.8 reads `input` word for word, so directions are spoken aloud.
- Run with network access to `openrouter.ai`.

Then continue to [retime.md](../retime.md).

## Style string

Keep `speech_metadata.style` short: one line of tone and pace. Long "director's notes" make the voice drift. Build it from the style intake answers (see [style_intake.md](../style_intake.md)):

| Intake answer | Style string |
|---|---|
| Default / conversational and warm | `confident, warm tech explainer; conversational, natural pace` |
| Enthusiastic | `upbeat and energetic, bright product-launch delivery` |
| Calm / serious | `calm, measured and authoritative; unhurried pace` |
| Playful | `playful and friendly, light and casual` |

One request has one style. For a tone change within the video (e.g., build to excited at the end), write the change into the text itself (see [provider_script.md](../provider_script.md)).

## Inline tags

Gemini supports inline vocal tags in angle brackets, e.g. `<breath>`, `<chuckle>`, `<sigh>`, `<short pause>`, `<long pause>`. **Do not write them into the provider script.** In tests, pause tags on their own line or mid-sentence caused repeated phrases, spoken tag names ("short pause"), and random noises in 6 of 9 voices. The same `<long pause>` tag at the end of a line (added by `--pause-tag` at each `[[pause]]` marker) was clean in 5 of 5 voices. Use `[[pause]]` markers for pauses (see [provider_script.md](../provider_script.md)). Use a vocal tag only if the user asks for that sound, and always run the transcript check after.

## Long scripts

For scripts over about 5,000 characters (~5 minutes), split the provider script at a `[[pause]]` marker, generate one `raw_partN.mp3` per part with the same voice and style, and join them into `raw.mp3` (see [Join clips end to end](../../ffmpeg_cookbook.md#join-clips-end-to-end)). Then run the retime step on the joined file. The marker at the join sets the pause length there.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Resolution |
|---|---|
| HTTP 401 | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is missing or wrong in `.env`. |
| HTTP 402 | The account or key is out of credits, or the key's credit limit is reached. Add credits or raise the limit at https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys. |
| HTTP 400 `only supports response_format="pcm"` | Set `response_format` to `"pcm"`. |
| Audio sounds like noise or chipmunks | The PCM was decoded with the wrong format. Use `-f s16le -ar 24000 -ac 1`. |
| Directions are spoken aloud | Move them from the text into `speech_metadata.style`. |
| Transcript check fails | Regenerate (takes vary). Remove any inline tags. If it fails 3 times, try another voice and tell the user. |
| Mispronounced word | Add a phonetic spelling in the provider script (see [provider_script.md](../provider_script.md#step-4-pronunciation-and-special-terms)). |
