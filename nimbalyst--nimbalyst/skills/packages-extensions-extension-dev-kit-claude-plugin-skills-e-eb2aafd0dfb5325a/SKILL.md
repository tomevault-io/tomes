# Extension Development in Nimbalyst

Nimbalyst provides MCP tools for building, installing, and hot-reloading extensions directly from within the running app. This enables rapid iteration on extension development without manually running build commands.

The recommended in-app scaffold flow uses `File > New Extension Project`, `Developer > New Extension Project`, or the Extension Developer Kit's `/new-extension` command. Enable Extension Dev Tools in Settings > Advanced before using the build/install workflow.

## Available MCP Tools

### Build Extension
```
mcp__nimbalyst-extension-dev__extension_build
```
Runs `npm run build` (vite build) on an extension project.

**Parameters:**
- `path`: Absolute path to the extension project root (directory containing package.json and manifest.json)

**Returns:** Build output including any errors or warnings.

### Install Extension
```
mcp__nimbalyst-extension-dev__extension_install
```
Installs a built extension into the running Nimbalyst instance. The extension must be built first.

**Parameters:**
- `path`: Absolute path to the extension project root

**Returns:** Installation status and any validation warnings.

### Hot Reload Extension
```
mcp__nimbalyst-extension-dev__extension_reload
```
Rebuilds and reinstalls an extension in one step. This is the most common tool for iterating on extension development.

**Parameters:**
- `extensionId`: The extension ID from manifest.json (e.g., "com.nimbalyst.my-extension")
- `path`: Absolute path to the extension project root

**Returns:** Build and reload status.

### Uninstall Extension
```
mcp__nimbalyst-extension-dev__extension_uninstall
```
Removes an installed extension from the running Nimbalyst instance.

**Parameters:**
- `extensionId`: The extension ID to uninstall

### Get Extension Status
```
mcp__nimbalyst-extension-dev__extension_get_status
```
Gets the current status of an installed extension, including whether it loaded successfully and what it contributes.

**Parameters:**
- `extensionId`: The extension ID to query

### Restart Nimbalyst
```
mcp__nimbalyst-extension-dev__restart_nimbalyst
```
Restarts the entire Nimbalyst application. **Only use when explicitly requested by the user.**

## Testing Tools

### Run Playwright Tests
```
mcp__nimbalyst-extension-dev__extension_test_run
```
Execute Playwright scripts against the running Nimbalyst instance via CDP. Supports inline scripts or `.spec.ts` file paths.

**Parameters:**
- `script`: Inline Playwright code (runs inside an async test with `page` connected to Nimbalyst)
- `testFile`: Absolute path to a `.spec.ts` file
- `timeout`: Max execution time in ms (default: 30000)

Provide either `script` or `testFile`, not both.

### Open File for Testing
```
mcp__nimbalyst-extension-dev__extension_test_open_file
```
Opens a file in Nimbalyst and waits for the editor to mount. Use before running tests that need a specific file open.

**Parameters:**
- `filePath`: Absolute path to the file to open
- `waitForExtension`: Extension ID to wait for (waits until the extension's editor container renders)
- `timeout`: Max wait time in ms (default: 5000)

### Test AI Tool Handler
```
mcp__nimbalyst-extension-dev__extension_test_ai_tool
```
Execute an extension's AI tool handler directly and return the result. Bypasses full MCP routing.

**Parameters:**
- `extensionId`: The extension ID
- `toolName`: Tool name without extension prefix (e.g., "get_elements")
- `args`: Arguments object to pass to the handler
- `filePath`: For editor-scoped tools: file path for context

## Development Workflow

### Initial Setup
1. Create extension project with `/new-extension <path> <name> [file-patterns]`
2. Implement the extension code
3. Build with `extension_build`
4. Install with `extension_install`
5. Test in Nimbalyst

### Iteration Loop with Testing
1. Make code changes
2. Run `extension_reload` to rebuild and reinstall
3. Run `extension_get_status` to verify it loaded
4. Run `extension_test_open_file` to open a sample file
5. Run `extension_test_run` with Playwright scripts to verify behavior
6. Use `capture_editor_screenshot` for visual verification
7. Check `get_renderer_debug_logs` for runtime errors
8. Fix issues and repeat from step 1

**Inline test example:**
```
extension_test_run({
  script: `
    const editor = page.locator('[data-extension-id="com.nimbalyst.my-ext"]');
    await expect(editor).toBeVisible();
    await editor.locator('.save-btn').click();
    await expect(editor.locator('.status')).toHaveText('Saved');
  `
})
```

**Test file example:**
```
extension_test_run({ testFile: "/path/to/extension/tests/basics.spec.ts" })
```

### Debugging
1. Check extension status with `extension_get_status`
2. Read logs with `mcp__nimbalyst-extension-dev__get_main_process_logs` (filter by component: "EXTENSION")
3. Check renderer logs with `mcp__nimbalyst-extension-dev__get_renderer_debug_logs`

## Important Notes

- **Always build before install** - `extension_install` requires a pre-built extension
- **Use `extension_reload` for iteration** - It combines build + reinstall in one step
- **Check manifest validation** - Build and install tools validate manifest.json and report warnings
- **Extensions load on app start** - For full reload, user may need to restart Nimbalyst
- **Never restart without permission** - Only use `restart_nimbalyst` when the user explicitly asks

## Common Issues

### "Extension not found" after install
- Check that the extension ID in manifest.json matches what you're querying
- Verify the build output exists in `dist/index.js`

### Build fails
- Check that `npm install` was run in the extension directory
- Verify vite.config.ts is properly configured
- Check for TypeScript errors in the output

### Extension doesn't appear
- Use `extension_get_status` to check if it's loaded
- Check the release channel - some extensions require "alpha" channel
- Verify the extension is enabled in Settings > Extensions
