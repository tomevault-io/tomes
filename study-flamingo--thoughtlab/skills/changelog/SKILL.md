# Changelog Generation

When invoked, generate a user-friendly changelog from git history.

## Process

1. Get commits since last release: `git log <tag>..HEAD --oneline`
2. Categorize by type (feat, fix, etc.)
3. Transform technical commits into user-friendly descriptions
4. Format as changelog

## Commands

```bash
# Commits since last tag
git log v1.0.0..HEAD --oneline

# Commits in date range
git log --since="2024-01-01" --oneline

# Commits with details
git log v1.0.0..HEAD --pretty=format:"%h %s"
```

## Changelog Format

```markdown
