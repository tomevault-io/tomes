# Terramate Best Practices

Comprehensive guide for Terramate CLI, Cloud, and Catalyst, maintained by Terramate. Contains best practices and usage patterns for stack management, orchestration, code generation, Cloud integration, and Catalyst components/bundles.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Creating and organizing Terramate stacks
- Orchestrating commands across multiple stacks
- Using code generation to keep configurations DRY
- Integrating with Terramate Cloud for observability
- Creating Catalyst components and bundles
- Setting up CI/CD workflows with Terramate
- Managing stack dependencies and execution order

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | CLI Fundamentals | CRITICAL | `cli-` |
| 2 | CLI Orchestration | HIGH | `cli-orchestration-` |
| 3 | CLI Code Generation | HIGH | `cli-codegen-` |
| 4 | CLI Configuration | MEDIUM-HIGH | `cli-config-` |
| 5 | Terramate Cloud | MEDIUM-HIGH | `cloud-` |
| 6 | Terramate Catalyst | MEDIUM | `catalyst-` |
| 7 | CI/CD Integration | MEDIUM | `cicd-` |
| 8 | Advanced Patterns | LOW-MEDIUM | `advanced-` |

## Quick Reference

### 1. CLI Fundamentals (CRITICAL)

- `cli-stack-structure` - Organize stacks with clear directory structure
- `cli-stack-config` - Configure stacks with proper stack blocks
- `cli-stack-metadata` - Use metadata for stack identification and filtering

### 2. CLI Orchestration (HIGH)

- `cli-orchestration-run` - Run commands across stacks efficiently
- `cli-orchestration-change-detection` - Use change detection to limit execution scope
- `cli-orchestration-parallel` - Leverage parallel execution for independent stacks
- `cli-orchestration-dependencies` - Manage stack dependencies and execution order

### 3. CLI Code Generation (HIGH)

- `cli-codegen-hcl` - Use generate_hcl for DRY Terraform code
- `cli-codegen-file` - Use generate_file for file generation patterns
- `cli-codegen-provider` - Generate provider configurations dynamically

### 4. CLI Configuration (MEDIUM-HIGH)

- `cli-config-globals` - Use globals for shared configuration across stacks
- `cli-config-lets` - Use lets for stack-local computed values
- `cli-config-metadata` - Leverage metadata for stack information

### 5. Terramate Cloud (MEDIUM-HIGH)

- `cloud-integration` - Set up Cloud connection and authentication
- `cloud-drift-management` - Configure drift detection and reconciliation
- `cloud-observability` - Use Cloud dashboard for stack visibility

### 6. Terramate Catalyst (MEDIUM)

- `catalyst-components` - Create reusable component blueprints
- `catalyst-bundles` - Define bundles for component composition
- `catalyst-instantiation` - Instantiate bundles correctly

### 7. CI/CD Integration (MEDIUM)

- `cicd-github-actions` - Set up GitHub Actions workflows
- `cicd-preview-workflows` - Create preview workflows for PRs
- `cicd-deployment-workflows` - Configure deployment automation

### 8. Advanced Patterns (LOW-MEDIUM)

- `advanced-workflows` - Create complex multi-step workflows
- `advanced-codegen-patterns` - Advanced code generation techniques

## How to Use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:

```
rules/cli-stack-structure.md
rules/cli-orchestration-run.md
rules/cli-codegen-hcl.md
rules/cloud-integration.md
rules/catalyst-components.md
```

Each rule file contains:
- Brief explanation of why it matters
- Incorrect/anti-pattern example with explanation
- Correct/best practice example with explanation
- Additional context and references
