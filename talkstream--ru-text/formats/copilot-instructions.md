# ru-text — Claude Code plugin for Russian text quality

**Author:** Arseniy Kamyshev (nafigator@gmail.com)
**Repo:** https://github.com/talkstream/ru-text
**Site:** https://ru-text.org
**Sponsors:** https://github.com/sponsors/talkstream
**Version:** 2.7.0 | **License:** MIT | **Platforms:** Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Cursor, Cline, JetBrains (Junie), Continue.dev, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Google Antigravity, OpenClaw, Notion

Over 2,000 independently formulated linguistic atoms across 7 thematic areas. No verbatim quotes, full source attribution.

## Priorities

1. **Quality** — every rule must be accurate and actionable
2. **User care** — plugin helps, never restricts. User's explicit style request overrides defaults
3. **Performance** — SKILL.md at most **650 words** (measured `LC_ALL=C wc -w`); references load on demand, not at startup. The figure used to read «under 600» and was false: the file was 615 words when nobody checked, and the always-on dash fix of 01.08.2026 took it to 640. The budget is now a gate in `tools/check-dogfood.sh`, not a sentence — a size claim about the one file loaded on every turn is exactly the kind that goes stale in silence.
4. **Legal safety** — no "distilled from", no implied endorsement, no author names in section headers

## Architecture

```
.claude-plugin/plugin.json      → Claude Code plugin metadata
.codex-plugin/plugin.json       → Codex CLI plugin metadata
.cursor-plugin/plugin.json      → Cursor plugin metadata
openclaw.plugin.json            → OpenClaw native plugin manifest
gemini-extension.json           → Gemini CLI extension metadata
(No new manifests needed — GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Cline, JetBrains Junie, and Continue.dev read standard SKILL.md natively)
skills/ru-text/SKILL.md         → always-on typography + routing table (≤650 words, gated, cross-platform)
skills/ru-text/references/      → 9 domain files + addenda + sources (loaded on demand)
skills/ru-text/agents/openai.yaml → Codex skill metadata (Claude ignores)
skills/ru-text/agents/gemini.yaml → Gemini skill metadata (Claude ignores)
skills/ru-check/SKILL.md        → /ru-text:ru-check full-corpus check (fork context, read-only; moved from commands/ in a2d26d1)
skills/ru-score/SKILL.md        → /ru-text:ru-score 0–10 quality score (fork context, read-only; moved from commands/ in a2d26d1)
notion/ru-text-notion-skill.md  → Notion AI Custom Skill template (self-contained, ~1450 words)
notion/README.md                → Bilingual Notion setup guide (AI Skill + MCP workflow)
README.md + README.en.md        → bilingual docs (RU primary = GitHub default; EN in README.en.md; welcoming EN switcher atop README.md)
PRIVACY_POLICY.md               → zero data collection statement
assets/icon.png                 → 512×512 marketplace icon (Codex composerIcon; derived from logo-round.png)
```

Progressive disclosure: Claude reads SKILL.md first (typography rules, top stop-words, routing table), then loads domain-specific references only when the task requires them.

## Commands

```bash
claude plugins validate /path/to/ru-text    # validate manifest
claude plugins marketplace update ru-text   # refresh marketplace cache
/ru-text                                    # activate skill manually
/ru-text:ru-check <text>                    # comprehensive quality check (fork context)
/ru-text:ru-score <text>                    # text quality score 0–10 (fork context)
```

## Conventions

### Legal (apply to ALL text in repo: README, CHANGELOG, commits, comments)
- NEVER say "distilled from" — use "informed by" or "independently formulated"
- NEVER imply source authors endorse this plugin
- NEVER use author names in section headers as if they endorse (e.g., "Nora Gal's principles" → "Clean language principles, cf. N. Gal")
- IP notice references: Article 1259(5) of the Russian Civil Code, 17 USC §102(b), Berne Convention

### What belongs in this repository, and what does not

**Paid is whatever deterministically FIXES arbitrary user text. Public is the corpus — rules
in prose — and detectors whose input set is hard-wired into this repository.**

Adopted 16.08.2026, after two adversarial panels and an arbiter were asked to find the leak
and found none: no file here has ever transformed text, and the history says so —
`git log --all --diff-filter=A --pretty=format: --name-only -- '*.ts' '*.js' '*.mjs'` is
empty. The scripts under `tools/` are discipline gates — the count is deliberately not
stated here, because a hand-maintained number goes stale in the commit that adds a file, and
this one did. `check-typography.sh` hard-wires three filenames in `FILES` and takes no
arguments at all, and its own header records that the
same patterns over the corpus files report 53 «violations» that are all correct content.
`check-dogfood.sh` does not detect stop-words in prose — it counts them in the reference and
verifies the documentation quotes the right number.

Three more obvious phrasings were tried and each broke on a real file. «Prose vs code» would
exile `check-typography.sh`, the very gate that enforces this repository's own typography
claim. «Needed by the skill vs needed by the service» would exile `check-frozen.sh`, which
exists *for* the paid service yet guards public bytes.

The surviving predicate is settled by one question a reviewer can grep: **does this file write
corrected text?** ⚠ There is no machine gate for it and there will not be one — telling a
detector from a transformer is reading, not matching. Calling it a check would make it a
promise without a mechanism, which is the exact debt this repository spends its gates
retiring. It is review discipline, and it is named as such.

**The predicate's second edge: detection is also the product.** A reviewer asking only «does
this file write corrected text?» would wave through a deterministic stop-word linter over
arbitrary prose — neither side of the line above claims it: it fixes nothing, and its input is
not hard-wired. Declined all the same. What may not ship here is deterministic code that
APPLIES this corpus — its rules, its dictionaries, or a derivative of them — to text from
outside this repository, whether the output is a correction or a report: reporting is the other
half of what the paid `ru_check` sells.

The word *deterministic* is load-bearing — the skills in this repository apply the corpus
through a model, and they stay exactly where they are. Two other neighbours also stay: gates
that apply the corpus to THIS repository's own files (`check-typography.sh`), and instruments
that read arbitrary text but apply no corpus rule to it and propose no change
(`measure-prose-shape.py` counts sentence-length variance; the AD-6 mention in its docstring is
motivation, not a pattern it matches). Same status as the predicate itself: no machine gate, and
there will not be one — «applies the corpus» and «arbitrary input» are read, not matched.

**Routing rule for new work:** deterministic code that applies the corpus to outside text —
correcting it or reporting on it — is born in the private service repository, from its first
commit. It is never written public-first — one public commit is
irreversible, and moving it afterwards buys nothing: what shipped under MIT stays shipped —
in every release tag and in every clone.

⚠ **The risk runs the other way.** Nothing already published can be recalled, so the danger is
not the past but the temptation to publish the engine for convenience — a wasm demo on the
site, an npm package «so people can try it». That would close the only moat the paid side has,
and it needs an explicit decision, never a convenience.

### How a rule earns its place

**A rule is justified by the LETTER of the corpus and by an inventory checked against the
blind key — never by the outcome of a single run.** Adopted 11.08.2026, after a carve-out
shipped with a justification that did not survive its own control: «one pass removed these
words six times» was true and useless, because the same prompt on the same file released them
in all three corpus snapshots tried, including the one whose run produced the removals.

Practically, three tests before a rule is written:

- **Does the corpus TEXT command something wrong?** That is checkable by reading, it is
  deterministic, and it stays true tomorrow. It is the only ground that holds.
- **Is the inventory direction-checked against the key?** A blind judge's VOTE is a fact; the
  causal story he writes beside it is a hypothesis, because he does not know which side was
  the intervention. One signal on this line was withdrawn when its attribution turned out
  inverted — the judge had described the untouched original as the damaged side.
- **Would the claim survive a second run?** If it rests on «the tool does X», it is a property
  of a coin whose bias nobody has measured. Say what the text now permits and forbids; never
  how often the model will do it.

Corollary for release notes and README: claims about the corpus text ship; claims about run
outcomes do not.

### Content
- New rules from experience → `addenda.md` (AD-1, AD-2, …), NOT domain files
- Reference files >100 lines must have Table of Contents
- SKILL.md description must stay under 250 chars (Claude truncates beyond that)
- Plugin must follow its own typography rules (dogfooding)
- **The corpus size is quoted as a floor, in atoms, and the floor is machine-counted.** «Over 2,000 linguistic atoms» / «более 2 000 лингвистических атомов». Reproduce the count with `tools/extract-atoms.sh skills/ru-text | wc -l` (2219 on 28.07.2026), and find every file that states the floor with `grep -rlE '2[ ,\xc2\xa0]000 (linguistic atoms|лингвистических атомов)|2,000\+ atoms' --include='*.json' --include='*.md' . | grep -v node_modules` — 9 on 28.07.2026, and NOT a number to memorise. This sentence used to say «in eleven files», which was itself a hand-maintained count and was itself wrong: the true figure was nine, and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` was still saying «~1,044 rules» on main while the sentence claimed the sweep was complete. The floor replaced «~1 044 rules», a figure nobody could reproduce. A floor is chosen on purpose: it survives the corpus growing, so adding a rule does not oblige anyone to re-stamp anything. Raise it only when the count clears the next thousand, and raise it everywhere in one commit

### plugin.json (Zod strict mode — unknown fields break the plugin silently)
- Valid fields: `name`, `version`, `description`, `author` (object: name, email, url), `homepage`, `repository` (string URL), `license`, `keywords` (array)
- NEVER add `tags`, `category`, `source` — these belong in marketplace.json only (issue #26555)
- `repository` must be a string, NOT an object — `"https://..."` not `{"type":"git","url":"..."}`
- After editing plugin.json: `claude plugins validate /path/to/ru-text` before committing
- Keep versions in sync across ALL manifests: .claude-plugin (plugin.json AND marketplace.json — two fields there), .codex-plugin, .cursor-plugin, gemini-extension.json, openclaw.plugin.json — and **the `**Version:**` header of this file** — eight points, and `tools/check-version.sh --print` lists them. The READMEs no longer state the version in prose: they carry a badge that renders it live from the releases API, so there is nothing there to go stale. The v1.10.1 gate caught those two prose lines advertising the previous release, and then caught this file doing the same; the badge removes the first failure mode rather than re-checking it
- Codex CLI is pre-1.0 and moves fast: 0.144.0 locally, 0.145.0 on npm as `@openai/codex` (28.07.2026). The note here said v0.118.0 for months. The plugin.json schema may change between minor versions, so re-check it at each release rather than trusting this line

### Dev workflow (local plugin testing)
- Update cache after source changes: `claude plugins marketplace update ru-text`
- Reinstall if cache is stale: `claude plugins uninstall ru-text && claude plugins install ru-text`
- Verify: `/reload-plugins` then `/doctor` — expect 0 plugin errors

### Git
- New commits on main (no amend, no force push — branch is protected)
- Commit message: no source author names, no "distilled", no problematic language

## Gotchas

- No build step, no dependencies — pure markdown plugin
- awesome-claude-code (hesreallyhim): NEVER submit via gh CLI — web form only, 14-day cooldown on violation
- Anthropic marketplaces (re-measured 2026-08-13): ru-text IS in `anthropics/claude-plugins-community` (2281 entries, index 1633, pinned by sha) and IS NOT in `anthropics/claude-plugins-official` (287 entries). ⚠ **The official tier CANNOT be applied for** — the docs say it outright: «There is no application process, and the submission form does not add plugins to the official marketplace» (code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins). The old note here claimed one form served both directories and that curators picked the tier; that was false, and it cost a session's worth of planning. The form (platform.claude.com/plugins/submit for an individual author; the claude.ai one needs a Team or Enterprise org) submits to the COMMUNITY marketplace only — its real use for us is replacing the curator-written listing description. `clau.de/plugin-directory-submission` is no longer a form: it 302s to the docs page holding those two links. PRs opened directly to either repo are auto-closed (read-only mirrors of Anthropic's internal pipeline). **Do NOT assume a release reaches community-marketplace users: measure the pin.** The nightly `bump-plugin-shas` sweep DOES reach us: `bump(ru-text): 44c2da92 → 98246bd7` merged 2026-08-09 (`gh pr view 2190 --repo anthropics/claude-plugins-community`). That retires the reading of 2026-07-28, when the same evidence — pin frozen at `44c2da92`, no `bump(ru-text)` in 300 commits, `max-bumps: 30` per nightly run against 2,000+ alphabetically-walked entries — was written up here as starvation to be escalated by asking a maintainer to fire `workflow_dispatch` with input `plugin: ru-text`. It is slow, not stuck, and the ask was never needed. Slow is still the operative word: measured 2026-08-13, the pin is `98246bd7` = a commit of 2026-08-01, BEFORE v2.1.0 — catalogue users are three releases behind. **Never write in user-facing docs that the pin advances within a day.** The listing DESCRIPTION is curator-written («~1,040 rules», «Eight reference files», «Auto-activates on Russian text output» — behaviour 2.2.0 removed), and the form is how it gets replaced: the director filed a submission carrying our manifest string on 2026-08-12, and platform.claude.com/plugins shows it **Published**. That is the portal's state, not the catalogue's — measured the same hour, the mirror still serves the curator text and the old pin. Approval in the portal is not delivery to users; read the mirror before claiming either. PRs to either repo are still auto-closed — no manual sha-bump path
- **Claude Desktop and Cowork sync this repo as a MARKETPLACE, and a server-side validator gates it — one stricter than ours.** Measured 2026-08-12: sync failed with a UI message carrying no diagnosis («Marketplace sync failed. Check the repository URL and try again.») while the real error sat in `~/Library/Logs/Claude/claude.ai-web.log`: a unicode escape in a SKILL.md frontmatter (`emoji: "\U0001F4DD"`, shipped since v1.6.0) rejects the WHOLE marketplace. `claude plugin validate` does not check for this, so a green local gate and a failing sync coexisted for months. On any external rejection read that log — never guess from the UI.
- **`displayName` exists and we need it**: without it the UI derives a label from `name` and shows «Ru text». Set in both `plugin.json` and the marketplace entry (different surfaces read different ones). There is NO icon field in either schema — checked both references end to end, and Anthropic's own working marketplace entry carries four keys with no image among them.
- **Two public installers work on this repo and are documented in INSTALL.md § «Одной командой»**: `npx skills add talkstream/ru-text` (Vercel Labs, installs all three skills, 376 installs on skills.sh) and `npx skillsbd add talkstream/ru-text/ru-text` (NeuralDeep, one skill, 162). Neither pins a version — both clone `main`, so there is nothing to update on their side. Do not confuse this with the community-marketplace pin, which lags for weeks.
- **Outside Claude Code the frontmatter accepts exactly six keys** (`name, description, license, compatibility, metadata, allowed-tools`) — that is the claude.ai upload, the Skills API and `package_skill.py`. `ru-text` passes; `ru-check` and `ru-score` do not (`disallowed-tools`, `context: fork`, `user-invocable`) and have no business there. The Skills API in Console is a workspace-private store for API and Managed Agents, NOT a catalogue: no public listing. `anthropics/skills` is spec and examples, not a channel — no CONTRIBUTING (404).
- Version bump in plugin.json is REQUIRED for users to get updates (Claude Code uses version for cache invalidation)
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is a Claude-Code-only token. Valid contexts: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, hooks, MCP/LSP configs, and any other file consumed only by Claude Code. NEVER use it in `skills/ru-text/SKILL.md` body or other cross-platform skill content — Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, JetBrains Junie, Continue.dev, Gemini CLI, and GitHub Copilot do not substitute it and would render the literal `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/...` string in their UI (regression fixed in v1.7.2). In skill bodies, use relative paths like `references/<filename>`; the existing Glob fallback in SKILL.md covers any nonstandard marketplace layout in Claude Code
- `content/originals/` contains pre-compaction backups — gitignored, do not delete
- marketplace.json does NOT support `$schema` or root-level `description` — use `metadata.description`
- **Codex and ChatGPT now share a plugin system**, and we document only half of it: «Plugins are available with ChatGPT Work on the web and with ChatGPT Work or Codex in the ChatGPT desktop app. Codex CLI also has a plugin browser» (learn.chatgpt.com/docs/plugins, 28.07.2026). ChatGPT Work users install from the **Work** switcher → **Plugins** — an audience our docs never addressed. The CLI also has a NON-interactive install we never documented: `codex plugin add <PLUGIN>@<MARKETPLACE>`, verified against the live 0.144.0 binary
- **Codex ships `claude-plugins-official` as a default marketplace** (`codex plugin marketplace list` on a stock install shows it alongside openai-primary-runtime, openai-bundled and openai-curated). ru-text is NOT in it — we are in `claude-plugins-community`. Promotion to the official tier would deliver ru-text to Codex users with zero setup, so it is worth more than one channel — but there is no way to ask for it (see the Anthropic-marketplaces note above): the decision is Anthropic's alone, and the only lever is the plugin itself
- Codex CLI: self-serve publishing IS now available — the submission portal at platform.openai.com/plugins explicitly accepts «a skills-only plugin that packages reusable workflows», which is what ru-text is (developers.openai.com/plugins/deploy/submission.md, verified 28.07.2026). The old note said it was unavailable as of v0.118.0. A first-party listing also removes the marketplace-add prerequisite the third-party catalogue imposes. **Done: submitted and PUBLISHED 30.07.2026 (2.0.1), re-submitted and published for 2.3.0 on 12.08.2026** — the flow is an uploaded archive, not a repo link, and the portal's Info tab arrives pre-filled from it
- Codex docs moved and are now split across two hosts: install and usage at learn.chatgpt.com/docs/plugins (developers.openai.com/codex/plugins 308-redirects there), manifest and packaging at developers.openai.com/plugins/build/plugins. Append `.md` to any page URL for raw markdown
- Codex install is NOT a bare `/plugins` browse: a marketplace has to be configured first — `codex plugin marketplace add <owner>/<repo>` — and a new session started before the bundled skills load
- awesome-codex-plugins (hashgraph-online): community Codex marketplace where ru-text is listed. Generator-driven — `scripts/generate_plugins_json.py` fetches each plugin's repo HEAD and derives the entry's icon from `interface.composerIcon` (icon lives in `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, NOT root `plugins.json`; icon file must be ≤50KB, SVG preferred/PNG accepted). Push `composerIcon` + the icon file to your HEAD BEFORE the mirror PR, else the icon is silently dropped. Hard CI gate: `validate-plugin-pr.py` (run locally with `--base-ref origin/main`). Icon added v1.7.3 (`assets/icon.png`), mirror PR #162 (issue #11). Full mechanics in project memory `reference_awesome_codex_plugins.md`
- GitHub Copilot: reads `.github/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/` — all three. Also `~/.copilot/skills/` global. Submit to github/awesome-copilot (staged branch, not main)
- Windsurf: reads `.windsurf/skills/` and can read `.claude/skills/` if cross-agent enabled. Manual: Cascade > Customizations > Skills. No official directory; third-party: windsurf.run
- Cline: reads `.cline/skills/` and `.claude/skills/` natively. Enable via Settings > Features > Enable Skills. No official marketplace
- JetBrains Junie: reads `.junie/skills/` ONLY — does NOT auto-read `.claude/skills/` (detects but requires manual import). Works in all JetBrains IDEs. No skills marketplace
- Continue.dev: reads `.continue/skills/` and `.claude/skills/`. Continue Hub exists but no skill submissions yet
- SKILL.md is cross-platform (Claude Code + GitHub Copilot + Windsurf + Cursor + Cline + JetBrains Junie + Continue.dev + Codex + Gemini CLI) — do NOT duplicate it
- Cursor: marketplace at cursor.com/marketplace/publish, manual review. `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` ready
- Gemini CLI: auto-discovery via `gemini-cli-extension` GitHub topic (added). Gallery at geminicli.com/extensions/
- OpenClaw: natively reads `.claude-plugin/` as bundles. Native manifest `openclaw.plugin.json`. ClawHub: published at clawhub.ai/talkstream/ru-text (the listing tracks the latest release; do not pin a version in this note — it goes stale). Publish CLI: `npm i -g clawhub && clawhub login && clawhub skill publish ./skills/ru-text --slug ru-text --version <semver>`. **Always pass `--version` explicitly on a minor or major bump.** The old note here said the flag is REQUIRED and that omitting it fails with `Error: --version must be valid semver`. That is false, and false in the direction that ships the wrong number: on clawhub 0.23.1 the guard fires only when the flag IS supplied and malformed (`dist/cli/commands/publish.js:44-45`), and omitting it defaults to the registry's NEXT PATCH. Verified by dry run — without the flag it printed «Would publish ru-text@1.10.2» and exited 0, so publishing 2.0.0 without `--version 2.0.0` would silently ship a patch. `skill publish` reads no version from the skill folder or any repo manifest, so bumping `openclaw.plugin.json` is not a safety net. ⚠ **Репетиции больше нет:** на установленной сборке у `skill publish` НЕТ ни `--dry-run`, ни `--no-input` — `clawhub skill publish --help` печатает только `--slug`, `--name`, `--owner`, `--migrate-owner`, `--version`, `--fork-of`, `--changelog`, `--tags`. Замерено 10.08.2026, когда прежняя запись отправила меня репетировать несуществующим флагом. Публикация — одноразовое действие без прогона, поэтому `--version` перепроверять глазами до нажатия. Install and update refs are owner-qualified: `openclaw skills install @talkstream/ru-text`, `openclaw skills update @talkstream/ru-text` — bare slugs are only tolerated for already-installed or unambiguous skills
- OpenClaw indexes ru-text as a **skill** (not plugin). Users install via `openclaw skills install ru-text`, NOT `openclaw plugins install`
- Cursor: standalone skill path is `~/.cursor/skills/ru-text`. Full plugin local testing: `~/.cursor/plugins/local/ru-text/` (requires `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`). `.agents/skills/` IS read by Cursor now, at both project and user level — cursor.com/docs/skills lists `.agents/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, `~/.cursor/skills/`, plus compatibility with `.claude/skills/` and `.codex/skills/` (verified 28.07.2026; the older note here said the opposite). PR #8 confirmed the bug; `plugins/local/` confirmed by Cursor engineer in cursor/plugin-template#4
- NeuralDeep (neuraldeep.ru): listed and live — the April 2026 submission passed moderation. Catalogue at neuraldeep.ru/skills accepts «формат claude-skill и любые репозитории со SKILL.md»; install CLI `npx skillsbd add owner/repo/skill`. Web form at neuraldeep.ru/submit (GitHub OAuth required)
- Notion: no plugin architecture. Two integration paths: (1) Notion AI Custom Skill template page in `notion/`, (2) MCP bridge (Claude Code + Notion MCP server). Notion AI Skills require Business/Enterprise plan. Template must be self-contained (no `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` paths)
