# Self-Reviewing Commit for TTstack

Review owned worktree changes → fix confirmed defects → validate → local commits.
No deploy; no version bump or tag unless the user asks. New commits only
(no amend, rebase, or force-push).

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` — optional Git pathspecs or a summary of what to commit. Given
pathspecs → only matching changes are candidates; everything else is baseline.
Empty → all intended changes. Unknown flags → reject; never guess. Pathspecs matching
no change → nothing is intended.

## Setup

Read `.claude/docs/workflow-policy.md`, `.claude/docs/commit-protocol.md`,
`.claude/docs/review-core.md`, `.claude/docs/lifecycle-patterns.md`,
`.claude/docs/false-positive-guide.md`. Preflight and ledger before the first edit.

## Protocol

### 1. Scope

1. `git status --short`, full diffs, intended untracked files (`git diff HEAD` misses them).
2. Nothing intended → "nothing to commit"; stop.
3. Freeze owned paths; later, stage only that set plus this invocation's fix and
   format paths.
4. Split coherent units: one issue, root cause, or behavior each. Tests, docs, and the
   registry entry stay with the unit.
5. Unrelated overlap in the same hunk → stop. No stash, revert, or absorb.

### 2. Review and fix

1. Map paths via the Subsystem Map; read the full changed functions, callers, error
   paths, and tests.
2. Check the mapped invariants in `lifecycle-patterns.md`; refute candidates through
   `false-positive-guide.md`.
3. Fix confirmed defects completely, with a regression test. An unaccepted public or
   persisted-contract break stays uncommitted and Open.
4. A real but disproportionate fix → Won't Fix with a reason recorded in
   `docs/audit.md`, never only in chat. No progress on a repeat pass → stop and report.

Investigation may run in parallel; edits and commits are sequential.

### 3. Validate and commit

`commit-protocol.md` per unit: format, focused test, exact staging, inspect the cached
diff, one new commit with an English Conventional Commit message.

### 4. Final gate

`commit-protocol.md` once per stable code state. Push only when the task or session
already authorizes it.

## Output

Files and subsystems · fixes and registry changes · validations · hashes and subjects ·
untouched baseline · what remains unverified.
