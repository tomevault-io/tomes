> - `plugins/omo/**`, `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, `marketplace.json` and `.github/workflows/pr-source-guidance.yml` are synced from the oh-my-openagent repository and are rewritten on every sync. Never hand-edit them: change their source in oh-my-openagent (the plugin's test rules live in `packages/omo-codex/plugin/test/AGENTS.md` there).

# Agent notes: lazycodex

## What you may edit
- `plugins/omo/**`, `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, `marketplace.json` and `.github/workflows/pr-source-guidance.yml` are synced from the oh-my-openagent repository and are rewritten on every sync. Never hand-edit them: change their source in oh-my-openagent (the plugin's test rules live in `packages/omo-codex/plugin/test/AGENTS.md` there).
- `src/` is a git submodule of oh-my-openagent.
- The hand-owned parts are the root `test/`, `bin/` and `packages/web/`.

## Tests
- Root: `npm test`, which runs `node --test test/*.test.mjs`.
- Plugin: `npm test` from the plugin directory (the suite is owned upstream, see above).
- Web: `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run type-check` and the Playwright suite (see `packages/web/AGENTS.md`).

## Test authoring gate
Before adding or changing a test, answer all four; a missing answer means do not add it yet:
1. What observable behavior, invariant, or independent contract does it protect?
2. What credible regression makes it fail?
3. Why does existing coverage not already catch that failure? Each contract has one primary test owner at the strongest boundary; extend a table case or shared fixture instead of adding a near-duplicate.
4. Does it need a production seam (export, flag, wrapper, injection hook) no production caller needs? If yes, test at the real boundary instead.
Junk patterns (reject unless the retention bar below applies): assertion-free probes; self-comparisons and identity copiers; copied fixtures, inventories, manifests or export lists; exact source, import or string greps; private call-shape tests duplicated at a real boundary; duplicate invocations of one contract; replays of a shared helper through a wrapper; tests that exist to keep a test-only export or wrapper alive; production code whose only callers are tests; expected values produced by the code under test; mocks that implement the asserted behavior; fixture-supplied receipts or postconditions the code under test should produce; assertions against a store nothing writes; capability or flag restatements without a delivery proof; negative controls that pass for an unrelated reason; names that promise more than the input exercises.
Retention bar: keep a pattern match only when it independently guards a public API, protocol, config, migration, storage, security, platform, default, prompt-byte, generated or cross-language, package, release, or architecture contract, and say which one in the test. Static or slow is never a deletion reason. A retained test that fails on the base is a product bug to fix at its owner, never a test to delete.
A bug regression test must fail on the pre-fix code for the intended reason; an existing owner test that already fails may serve as that proof.
Method source: openclaw test-audit skill.
