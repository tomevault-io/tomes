# iii-directory

The directory worker is how an agent finds its way around the engine. It does
three things: serves the markdown docs installed workers ship (`directory::skills::*`),
serves the slash-command prompt templates a human runs (`directory::prompts::*`),
and proxies the public worker catalogue at `api.workers.iii.dev`
(`directory::registry::*`). It is also the only worker that writes — a download
pulls a bundle onto disk. Everything else here is read-only.

Two kinds of id flow through this worker and they must not be mixed up. A
**callable id** uses `::` (`directory::skills::get`) and goes in the `function:`
field of `agent_trigger`. A **skill id** uses `/` (`iii-sandbox`,
`agent-memory/observe`) and names a *document* — pass it as the `id` argument to
`directory::skills::get`. The ids that `list` and `index` print are skill ids; a
worker's overview is the bare worker name (`iii-sandbox`, not `iii-sandbox/index`,
and the `iii-` prefix is never dropped). Use the id you were given — do not
invent one.

Only **installed** workers are visible. `index`, `list`, and `get` show on-disk
skills for installed workers, plus this worker and the `iii` engine which are
always present. A skill you know exists stays invisible until its worker is
downloaded, so when one is missing, install it and look again. With
`auto_download` enabled the worker subscribes to the engine `worker` add event
and pulls a newly added worker's skills automatically, so freshly installed
workers can appear without a manual download.

## When to Use

- You need to see which workers are installed — `directory::skills::index` (token-light; start here).
- You need to read a worker's overview or a deeper doc it linked to — `directory::skills::get`.
- You need to find a skill across the repo with filters — `directory::skills::list`.
- You need the slash-command prompt templates a worker ships — `directory::prompts::list` / `get`.
- You are about to build against a worker you have **not** installed — `directory::registry::workers::info` returns the same schema shape you would get after install.
- You need to install a published worker's skills — `directory::skills::download_from_registry`.
- You can only reach the `directory::` namespace but need one engine function's exact schema — `directory::engine::functions::info`.

## Boundaries

- Only installed workers are visible. If the engine daemon is unreachable at boot, filtering is skipped and everything on disk is shown instead.
- Downloading is the only write; every read function leaves disk untouched.
- Not the live-connection view. `directory::*` reflects what is on disk or in the registry, not what is connected right now. For that, call the engine directly (`engine::functions::list`, `engine::workers::list`, …); daemon-managed providers (`iii-http`, `iii-cron`, `iii-state`) open no WebSocket, so merge `worker::list` by `name`.
- Do not put a skill id (`/`) in `agent_trigger`'s `function:` field, and do not pass a function id (`::`) to `directory::skills::get`.
- Prompt files without a `description:` in frontmatter are silently skipped by `directory::prompts::list`.
- Registry answers (`registry::workers::list` / `info`) are cached ~60 s per unique input by default (`registry_cache_ttl_ms`) — change a parameter to refresh.

## Functions

- `directory::skills::index` — token-light per-worker overview, one block per installed worker; truncates and tells you to call `list` when large.
- `directory::skills::list` — enumerate every visible skill with id/title/type/description/bytes/modified_at; narrow with `search`, `prefix`, `type`, or `include_description`.
- `directory::skills::get` — read one skill doc by its skill id; forgiving about short names, a trailing `.md`, an `iii://` prefix, and `SKILL.md` filenames.
- `directory::skills::download_from_registry` — install a published worker's skills from the registry; `worker` required, pin with `version` XOR `tag` (default `tag: latest`).
- `directory::skills::download_from_repo` — pull one skill folder from a GitHub repo; `repo` + `skill` required, `branch` defaults to `main`.
- `directory::skills::download` — flexible alias accepting either source set; prefer the two explicit forms so the source is unambiguous.
- `directory::prompts::list` — list slash-command prompt templates (only files carrying a frontmatter `description`).
- `directory::prompts::get` — read one prompt template's body by name.
- `directory::registry::workers::list` — page through published workers in the public registry (`pagination.next_cursor` feeds the next page's `cursor`).
- `directory::registry::workers::info` — full registry detail for one worker, including ones not installed: `api_reference` (functions + triggers with schemas) and `skills_tree`.
- `directory::engine::functions::info` — thin proxy to the engine's `engine::functions::info`; returns request/response schema, metadata, and registered triggers for one function id.

A failed call returns one plain sentence carrying a `Did you mean:` suggestion and a `Next:` function to call (codes `D110`/`D112`/`D210`/`D310`/`D311`, or `D320` when the registry is unreachable) — follow it instead of retrying the same input. Downloads overwrite file-by-file, so hand-edited extra files survive a re-pull.

## Reactive triggers

The worker publishes two custom trigger types — `directory::skills::on-change`
and `directory::prompts::on-change` — that fire after a successful download
writes at least one skill (respectively prompt) markdown file. Bind one when a
*different* worker must react to the on-disk skill/prompt set changing; the `mcp`
worker uses this to emit `notifications/*_list_changed` to its clients without
re-polling.

Reach for it when:

- A worker caches the skill or prompt list and must invalidate it on change.
- You want a push the moment new bundles install, instead of polling `directory::skills::list`.

Do not bind when:

- You ran the download yourself — its return payload already lists `skills_written` / `prompts_written`.

### How to bind

1. Register a handler: `registerFunction('my-worker::on-skills-changed', handler)`.
2. Register the trigger:

```typescript
iii.registerTrigger({
  type: 'directory::skills::on-change',
  function_id: 'my-worker::on-skills-changed',
})
```

Delivery is fire-and-forget (best-effort, at-most-once): a slow or failing
subscriber is logged and skipped so it cannot block the write path. `on-change`
fires only on a download that wrote at least one matching file — direct edits
under `skills_folder` and read calls do not fire it. For the event payload
shape, call `get function info` on the trigger type.
