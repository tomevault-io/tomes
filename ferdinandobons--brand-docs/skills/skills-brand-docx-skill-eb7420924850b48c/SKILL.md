# brand-docx

Use this skill when the user wants a reusable Word brand kit or wants to create
a new on-brand `.docx` from a company template and variable content.

This is an AI-agent skill for Codex and Claude Code. The user should not need to
write JSON or run shell commands. The agent converts the user's content into an
IntermediateDocument, invokes the internal engine, verifies the output, and
returns the generated `.docx`.

## The seven verbs: three deterministic + four model-assisted

Every brand skill (`brand-docx`, `brand-pptx`, `brand-xlsx`) implements the same
contract. The deterministic core is **extract / verify / generate**; on top of it
sit the optional learning verbs **comprehend / learn / propose-overrides /
refine**, each fail-closed (the engine validates every proposal and authors every
value).

| Verb | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **extract** | a company `.docx` template | a reusable Brand Profile |
| **comprehend** *(optional, model-driven)* | a saved profile + a model-authored `comprehension.json` | the profile with a validated, cached `comprehension` block |
| **verify** | a saved Brand Profile | QA findings + a verdict |
| **generate** | content (an IntermediateDocument) + a profile | a new on-brand `.docx` |
| **learn** *(deterministic distillation)* | the profile's cross-run generation history | recurring QA findings distilled into shell-frozen overrides, advisory until `--accept` |
| **propose-overrides** *(model-driven)* | the recurring remainder `learn` could not bind + a model-authored proposal | shell-backed corrections through the same fail-closed sink, advisory until `--accept` |
| **refine** | end-of-generation user feedback (text or a screenshot) as a `refinement.json` delta | the existing comprehension overlaid for FUTURE generations, advisory until `--accept` |

`comprehend` is **optional**: `generate` works on the deterministic profile alone.
When a current comprehension is present, `generate` additionally reconciles the
template's preserved cover/index structures with the new content. See
[reference/comprehension.md](reference/comprehension.md) for the full step.

## Hard Rules

- Treat `python scripts/cli.py ...` as an internal engine command, not the user-facing workflow.
- `scripts/cli.py` is a LAUNCHER that locates the engine root by itself: it works from this skill folder AND from the repo/plugin root (set `BRAND_DOCS_ROOT` to override). Never guess deeper paths like `scripts/brandkit/...`.
- Run the dependency preflight before starting extract / comprehend / verify / generate, and report missing or unusable dependencies before proceeding.
- Extract opens the source template read-only and saves `brand-kit/<name>/template/shell.docx` byte-for-byte.
- Generate opens the saved shell and resolves every semantic block through `profile.json`.
- Do not put style names, colors, fonts, or brand identifiers in an IntermediateDocument.
- If the user did not provide a template or enough content, ask for the missing input.
- Return the generated file path plus a QA summary.
- Consult `profile.json.artifact_catalog` before generation when the user asks to mimic a specific piece of the template.

## Preflight (always first)

Before doing any work, run:

```bash
python scripts/cli.py doctor
```

Use its output to decide the run mode:

- If a required Python dependency is missing, install/repair it before extraction
  or generation; the core engine is not ready.
- If only visual renderers are missing or unusable (`soffice` plus `pdftoppm` or
  optional PyMuPDF/`fitz`), the
  core L0 workflow can still run, but a full visual audit cannot be claimed.
  Tell the user what is missing, include the install/repair hint printed by
  `doctor`, and either proceed with degraded QA or install the renderer first.
- If optional OCR (`tesseract`) is missing, the visual audit can still run, but
  rendered residual-text proof is incomplete. Report that limitation when
  judging stale placeholders or field caches.
- For `--qa deep` or `--qa strict`, prefer repairing/installing renderers before
  generation. If the environment cannot run them, `deep` generates a degraded
  manifest and `strict` fails with a visual proof blocker.

## Agent Workflow

1. Run the dependency preflight above and report any degraded capability.
2. Determine the brand name and locate the user-provided `.docx` template.
3. If no matching `brand-kit/<name>` exists, **extract** one.
4. **Comprehend** the template (optional, model-driven; see below). Skip when a
   current comprehension is already cached or no model is available.
5. Convert the user's requested content into `IntermediateDocument` JSON.
6. **Generate** the `.docx` with the internal engine.
7. Run **QA** and report any warnings honestly.
8. **Feedback** (only after returning the file): invite a refinement of the
   understanding for future documents (see below).

Before generation, inspect `profile.json.artifact_catalog` when the user asks
to mimic a specific template piece. It records OOXML parts, media parts,
paragraph/table styles, style details, sections/margins, paragraph samples,
and table counts.

## Authoring the IntermediateDocument

The IDoc is where "correct document" becomes "great document". Author it
role-first, against the profile, never style-first:

1. **Read `brand-kit/<name>/PROFILE.md` before writing a block.** It lists the
   role table (with scope, placement, required slots), the brand palette
   tokens, and the template's structural order. Choose every block by MEANING
   from that table; the engine resolves it to the template's own artifacts.
2. **Respect the skeleton.** Cover fields first (`cover.title`,
   `cover.subtitle`, extra cover `fields`), a `toc` block only where the
   template keeps one, then the freeform body.
3. **Shape the body for the reader.** One `heading` level 1 per major section
   and a real 1-2-3 hierarchy below it (the TOC regenerates from exactly these
   headings); paragraphs of 2-5 sentences; `list` blocks for enumerations
   (bullet for unordered, number for sequences); every `table` and `image`
   with a `caption` block so derived indexes regenerate from real content;
   `callout` sparingly, for genuinely load-bearing notes; `quote` only for
   actual quotations.
4. **Color discipline.** The named style already carries the brand: the
   default is NO run color. When emphasis is truly needed, reference a palette
   role (`primary`, `text`, ...) or a theme slot (`accent1`) from PROFILE.md,
   never a hex.
5. **Reuse before re-deriving.** When a comprehension is present, prefer its
   `component` / `section` fragments (`comprehension.fragments` in
   `profile.json`) with `{{slot}}` values over hand-building a recurring
   layout.
6. **Never name a style, font, size, or hex.** If a block needs something the
   role table cannot express, say so in the QA summary instead of inventing
   formatting: the resolver is the only author of values.

## Feedback (end of generation)

Ask for feedback **only after** you have returned the generated `.docx` and its
QA summary - never before or during generation. Invite the user to reply with
**text or a screenshot** of the document, and name the roles, palette colors, and
sections you actually used so the answer is concrete. A screenshot is your own
multimodal read; the engine only ever ingests the structured JSON delta you
distil from it.

Turn the answer into a small refinement delta of verbatim ids and merge it with
the `refine` verb (see [reference/comprehension.md](reference/comprehension.md)):

```bash
python scripts/cli.py refine --name <brand> --input refinement.json --accept
```

A refinement improves **FUTURE** generations of this brand only - it mutates the
saved profile, never the `.docx` you just produced. To apply it, generate again.

When the SAME QA finding recurs across runs, you can also propose a **shell-bound
correction** with `propose-overrides`: the `comprehend-input` bundle surfaces the
recurring `generation_history`, and you NAME a shell-backed re-point (a stub role to
an existing healthy role, a `number_format` mask the shell uses, or a captured demo
value) that the engine binds fail-closed (see
[reference/comprehension.md](reference/comprehension.md)). It is advisory until
`--accept`, improves **FUTURE** generations only, and every live correction surfaces
as an INFO `override_applied` finding in QA.

## Internal Extract

```bash
python scripts/cli.py extract --name <brand> --template <template.docx> --scope project
```

## Internal Comprehend (optional, model-driven)

Read [reference/comprehension.md](reference/comprehension.md) for the full
guidance, the six questions, and the anti-overfitting directive. In short:

```bash
python scripts/cli.py comprehend-input --name <brand>   # prints {facts, excerpt} for the model
python scripts/cli.py comprehend --name <brand> --input comprehension.json  # the ONLY writer
```

Skip this verb when `comprehension.status` is `present` **and** its
`source_shell_sha256` equals the live `provenance.shell.sha256` (a current
comprehension is already cached). A re-extract resets it to `absent`; re-run
`comprehend` only then. Never re-run it at generate time.

> **docx readiness.** The Word extractor surfaces cover anchors, TOC/list
> fields when present, and text regions. A current comprehension can therefore
> steer cover fill, index regeneration, and demo-region clearing. If a document
> genuinely has no TOC/list field, do not force one; a ref into an empty field
> inventory is fail-closed and will be rejected.

## Internal Verify

```bash
python scripts/cli.py verify --name <brand> --scope auto --qa auto
```

`--qa` selects the QA depth (see [reference/visual-audit.md](reference/visual-audit.md)):

- `fast`: deterministic **L0** only (schema, resolver targets, residual text, structural diffs).
- `auto`: L0 **+ L1** visual pixel proxies when renderers (`soffice` plus `pdftoppm` or optional PyMuPDF/`fitz`) are present; otherwise L0 plus a single INFO `visual.unavailable`.
- `deep`: L0 + L1 **+ a `visual_manifest.json`** and per-page PNGs; if `tesseract` is installed the manifest also includes OCR text/hits. The orchestrator must then run the **L2** step (see below).
- `strict`: deep visual audit plus gate errors when full render proof is unavailable or L1/OCR evidence is not clean.

Verify has no output to render, so all modes behave as L0 at verify time; the visual stages run at **generate** time.

## Internal Generate

```bash
python scripts/cli.py generate --name <brand> --input <intermediate-document.json> --output <output.docx> --scope auto --qa auto
```

See `reference/comprehension.md`, `reference/profile-schema.md`,
`reference/generation.md`, `reference/visual-audit.md`, and
`examples/intermediate-document.example.json`.

## Visual audit (two-stage)

The engine renders the output and runs deterministic pixel proxies, but the
**qualitative visual judgement is yours (the orchestrator), never the engine's** -
the Python engine never calls a model. To run the full two-stage audit:

1. Generate with `--qa deep`. The engine renders each page to a PNG, runs the L1
   proxies, and writes `visual_manifest.json` next to the output in an
   `<output-file>.visual/` dir, such as `report.docx.visual/` (a side artifact;
   the `.docx` bytes never change).
2. Read the manifest path from stdout (`visual manifest: <path>`).
3. Open the PNGs listed in `pages[*].png`. For every entry in `checklist`, judge
   PASS/FAIL against the rendered pages, taking `l1_findings` and `ocr.hits` into
   account.
4. If any checklist item FAILS (or an L1 `visual.blank_page` / `visual.edge_bleed`
   WARNING or `visual.ocr_residual_text` hit is confirmed as a real defect):
   **repair** the
   IntermediateDocument/content or the generated composition, **regenerate**,
   then **re-run the audit**. Loop until the checklist is clean, or until no
   further targeted repair can be justified without user input.

L1 findings are WARNING-only and never fail the gate by themselves; the real
qualitative gate is your L2 judgement.

During repair, treat the template as a source of reusable structure, not a rule
to preserve blindly. If inherited section breaks, front-matter scaffolding,
field-result caches, or other template structures create blank pages, stale
entries, overlaps, or visibly broken pagination, diagnose the structure as the
cause and make the smallest targeted composition change. It is acceptable to
collapse, move, or remove a template section break when preserving it damages the
final generated document. After every repair, regenerate and rerun `--qa deep` or
`--qa strict`.

## Current Guarantees and Limits

Generation opens the saved `.docx` shell, clears detected demo text, and applies
only styles resolved from `profile.json`. L0 QA catches schema problems,
unresolved roles, markdown literals, and residual demo text.

When a current comprehension is present, generation also fills the cover slots in
place (no duplicate title) and reconciles preserved indexes (a table of contents,
a list of tables/figures) against the new content (regenerating, preserving, or
purging stale entries) instead of carrying demo entries forward. Destructive
reconciliation is bounded: a clear/remove is honored only when determinism
corroborates and confidence clears a threshold, else the structure is kept with a
warning.

Extraction also records a broad `artifact_catalog`: OOXML parts, media parts,
paragraph/table styles, style details, sections/margins, paragraph samples, and
table counts. Use it to understand and describe template conventions beyond the
roles that are directly generatable today.

The two-stage visual audit closes the "L0-only" gap: L1 deterministic pixel
proxies catch rendered-layout defects L0 cannot see (blank/broken pages, content
bleeding past the printable margins), and the L2 manifest drives the
orchestrator's qualitative judgement and repair loop. See
[reference/visual-audit.md](reference/visual-audit.md).

DOCX visual overflow requires render-time QA with LibreOffice because Word
layout is not deterministic from OOXML alone. When `soffice` and both PDF
rasterizers (`pdftoppm`, optional PyMuPDF/`fitz`) are absent (e.g. CI), the
visual audit degrades cleanly to L0 plus a single INFO
`visual.unavailable`; exit codes are unchanged and the skill does not claim a
full no-overflow visual proof.
