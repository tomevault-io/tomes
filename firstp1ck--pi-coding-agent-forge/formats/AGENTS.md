# Repository documentation rules

This file applies to the whole repository. A more specific `AGENTS.md` in a package directory may add package-specific rules, but it must not weaken the documentation layers defined here.

## Documentation goal

Write documentation for the person reading it:

- `README.md` is the friendly starting point for users.
- `TECHNICAL.md` is an advanced user reference.
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` is for contributors and implementation details.

Do not put every fact in the README. Do not hide essential usage or safety information in a developer document. Move information between layers instead of deleting it.

## Required documentation layers

### `README.md` — human guide

The README answers:

1. What is this package or skill?
2. Why would I use it?
3. What can it do?
4. How do I install it?
5. How do I use it for the first time?
6. Is there anything important to configure or keep safe?
7. Where can I learn more?

Use plain language, short sections, and realistic examples. Keep exact command names, but explain what each important command does.

The README may contain:

- a one-sentence purpose;
- user-facing features;
- installation instructions;
- a practical first-use flow;
- common commands or example requests;
- essential requirements;
- prominent safety and privacy warnings;
- links to `TECHNICAL.md` when advanced user information exists.

The README must not contain:

- internal API endpoints;
- request or response payloads;
- schemas or protocol details;
- internal algorithms or architecture;
- source-file maps;
- contributor test commands and fixtures (user-facing health checks are allowed);
- benchmark implementation methods;
- repository contribution or package-publication internals. User-facing release steps remain allowed when release management is the package’s purpose.

### `TECHNICAL.md` — advanced user reference

`TECHNICAL.md` is still user documentation. It is not a developer dump.

It may contain:

- complete user commands and options;
- user-editable settings and environment variables;
- runtime requirements and supported platforms;
- storage and configuration locations users may need;
- compatibility and operational limitations;
- security and privacy behavior;
- safe update, migration, and rollback behavior;
- troubleshooting guidance;
- links to `DEVELOPMENT.md` for implementation details.

It must not contain:

- HTTP/API/RPC endpoint catalogs;
- request, response, or event payload formats;
- tool schemas or protocol contracts;
- internal state machines, algorithms, hash construction, or locking design;
- the package’s implementation source layout or implementation-specific file names;
- development setup, local linking, or repository package-publishing internals;
- test suites, fixtures, benchmarks, or contributor validation commands.

An API key, service address, user-visible confirmation hash, or health-check command may appear in `TECHNICAL.md` when an end user must configure, verify, or approve it. The package’s internal calls, hash construction, and test implementation belong in `DEVELOPMENT.md`.

### `DEVELOPMENT.md` — contributor guide

Create `DEVELOPMENT.md` only when the package has contributor or implementation information to preserve.

It is the correct place for:

- API and RPC endpoints;
- payloads, schemas, protocols, and event contracts;
- architecture and internal control flow;
- source layout and important implementation files;
- internal algorithms, hashes, locks, queues, caches, and storage formats;
- tool contracts intended for integrators;
- development installation and local linking;
- contributor tests, fixtures, benchmarks, and validation commands;
- repository maintenance and package-publication internals;
- contributor-only migration notes.

Start it with navigation back to the user documents:

```markdown
# Development guide: Package name

Contributor-only implementation, API, architecture, testing, and maintenance information.

[Back to README](README.md) · [Advanced user technical reference](TECHNICAL.md)
```

## Package and extension README structure

Use this structure for top-level `pi-extension-*` and `pi-package-*` packages:

````markdown
# Friendly package name

One sentence explaining the user outcome.

## What you can do

- Three to five specific user-facing features

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@firstpick/package-name
```

## How to use it

A short first-use flow, followed by the most useful commands or examples.

## Before you start

Only essential setup, safety, or privacy information. Omit this section when it adds no value.

## Technical details

See [TECHNICAL.md](TECHNICAL.md) for complete commands, configuration, compatibility, security, and troubleshooting information.
````

Adapt headings when a package has a better user-facing name, such as `Start it`, `Keep it private`, or `Remote access`. Do not remove the purpose, features, installation, practical usage, or technical-reference link.

## Skill README structure

Use this structure for top-level `pi-skill-*` packages:

````markdown
# Friendly skill name

One sentence describing the outcome.

## Helpful when

- Three recognizable situations

## What to share with Pi

- The context that improves the result

## Try asking

> One realistic request with useful scope or constraints.

## What you’ll get

- Three concrete outputs

## Keep in mind

One short limitation or safety note.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@firstpick/pi-skill-name
```

## Technical details

See [TECHNICAL.md](TECHNICAL.md) for advanced usage, configuration, compatibility, and limitations.
````

Every skill must have distinct examples and advice. Do not copy the same generic example across skill packages.

## Documenting a new package

When adding a new first-party package:

1. Create its user-facing `README.md`.
2. Add `TECHNICAL.md` when users need advanced commands, configuration, compatibility, security, or troubleshooting.
3. Add `DEVELOPMENT.md` when implementation or contributor material exists.
4. Link the documents in both directions.
5. Add the package to the correct group in the repository `README.md`.
6. Use the exact published package name in installation commands.
7. Include requirements and safety warnings before users encounter a failure or risk.
8. Keep nested fixture, template, test, worker, and vendored READMEs scoped to their own specialized audience.

Do not create an empty `DEVELOPMENT.md`. Do not create `TECHNICAL.md` merely to repeat the README.

## Documenting a change

Update documentation in the same change as user-visible behavior.

### New feature

- Add or update a plain-language feature bullet in `README.md`.
- Add a practical usage step, command, or example.
- Add advanced configuration or limitations to `TECHNICAL.md`.
- Add implementation contracts or tests to `DEVELOPMENT.md`.

### Changed command, option, or setup

- Update the first-use path and common command description in `README.md` when users will notice it.
- Update the complete command or configuration reference in `TECHNICAL.md`.
- Update parser, protocol, or implementation details in `DEVELOPMENT.md`.

### Changed security or privacy behavior

- Keep an essential warning in `README.md`.
- Explain user controls and operational consequences in `TECHNICAL.md`.
- Explain enforcement and internal safeguards in `DEVELOPMENT.md`.

### Deprecation or removal

- Remove stale feature claims and examples.
- Explain the user migration path in `README.md` or `TECHNICAL.md`.
- Keep implementation and compatibility history in `DEVELOPMENT.md` when contributors still need it.
- Update the repository package catalog when a package is renamed, replaced, or removed.

### Internal-only change

Do not add implementation detail to the README or technical reference. Update `DEVELOPMENT.md` when the information will help future contributors maintain or verify the package.

## Writing style

- Prefer everyday words and active voice.
- Explain unavoidable Pi-specific terms the first time they appear.
- Address the reader as “you” when giving instructions.
- Lead with the normal successful path; put rare options later.
- Use concrete examples instead of abstract descriptions.
- Keep paragraphs short and lists focused.
- Avoid marketing claims that cannot be verified.
- Avoid empty sections such as `Tools: None` unless the absence matters to users.
- Do not expose secrets, tokens, private paths, or real credentials in examples.
- Use descriptive image alternative text.
- Avoid version-specific screenshots or claims unless the version is clearly stated.

## Moving existing information

When information belongs in another layer:

1. Move it; do not silently delete it.
2. Rewrite the remaining text so headings and sentences are still complete.
3. Add a link to the destination document when readers may need it.
4. Remove duplicate low-level detail from user documents.
5. Preserve essential warnings in the README even when a fuller explanation exists elsewhere.

## Documentation checks

Before considering documentation complete:

- [ ] The README explains purpose, features, installation, and practical usage.
- [ ] Skill examples and package guidance are specific rather than boilerplate.
- [ ] `TECHNICAL.md` contains only advanced user information.
- [ ] API calls, schemas, architecture, tests, and source details are in `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
- [ ] The exact npm package name is used in install commands.
- [ ] Relative links resolve from the file containing them.
- [ ] Headings are not empty and sentences do not end in dangling colons.
- [ ] Fenced code blocks are balanced.
- [ ] Security and privacy warnings remain visible to users.
- [ ] The repository README catalog reflects new, renamed, or removed packages.
- [ ] Unrelated files and existing user changes are left untouched.

Run at minimum:

```bash
git diff --check -- '*.md' ':(exclude)**/node_modules/**' ':(exclude)**/vendor/**'
```

For large documentation changes, also check local links and scan `TECHNICAL.md` files for internal endpoint calls, payload/schema descriptions, source paths, test commands, and development-only headings.
