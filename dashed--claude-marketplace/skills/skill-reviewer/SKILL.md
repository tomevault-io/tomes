# Skill Reviewer

Ensure skills maintain high quality standards through systematic review.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Creating a new skill (before finalization)
- Updating an existing skill (after making changes)
- Auditing skill quality across your marketplace
- Reviewing team members' skill contributions

## Quick Review Process

### 1. Load the Skill

Read the skill's SKILL.md and check the directory structure:
```bash
ls -la path/to/skill/
cat path/to/skill/SKILL.md
```

### 2. Apply the 10-Point Checklist

Review against these core quality criteria:

1. **Progressive Disclosure** - Metadata/instructions/resources properly separated
2. **Mental Model Shift** - Describes skill as canonical approach, not "new feature"
3. **Degree of Freedom** - Matches instructions to declared autonomy level
4. **SKILL.md Conciseness** - Lean, actionable, purpose-driven
5. **Safety & Failure Handling** - Guardrails and recovery steps present
6. **Resource Hygiene** - References current, minimal, discoverable
7. **Consistency** - Terminology and flow clear and unambiguous
8. **Testing Guidance** - Verification steps or examples included
9. **Ownership (Optional)** - Known limitations documented; version/maintainer optional
10. **Tight Scope** - Focused purpose, no feature creep

### 3. Document Findings

Create a review report with:
- ✅ Criteria that pass
- ⚠️  Areas needing improvement
- 🔴 Critical issues requiring fixes
- 💡 Suggestions for enhancement

## Detailed Guidance

For in-depth review criteria and examples:

- **[Quality Checklist](references/quality-checklist.md)** - Comprehensive criteria with examples
- **[Progressive Disclosure](references/progressive-disclosure.md)** - Proper structure and information layering
- **[Mental Model Shift](references/mental-model-shift.md)** - Language and positioning guidance
- **[Common Pitfalls](references/common-pitfalls.md)** - What to avoid and how to fix
- **[Review Examples](references/examples.md)** - Sample reviews demonstrating the process

## Review Workflow

### For New Skills

1. **Structure Check**
   - Verify SKILL.md exists with proper frontmatter
   - Check references/ directory organization
   - Confirm scripts/ are executable if present

2. **Content Review**
   - Frontmatter: name (lowercase, hyphens), description (clear, comprehensive)
   - Body: Concise instructions with examples
   - Progressive disclosure: Core in SKILL.md, details in references/

3. **Quality Assessment**
   - Apply 10-point checklist
   - Verify mental model language
   - Check for appropriate scope and freedom level

### For Updated Skills

1. **Change Assessment**
   - Identify what changed (use git diff if available)
   - Verify changes align with skill's purpose
   - Check for scope creep or complexity additions

2. **Documentation Update**
   - Ensure SKILL.md reflects new capabilities
   - Update references/ if needed
   - Maintain progressive disclosure pattern

3. **Regression Check**
   - Verify existing examples still work
   - Check that changes didn't break mental model
   - Confirm scope remains focused

## Review Report Template

```markdown
# Skill Review: [skill-name]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Reviewer**: [name]
**Type**: [New|Update|Audit]

## Summary
Brief overview of the skill and review findings.

## Checklist Results

✅ Progressive Disclosure
✅ Mental Model Shift
⚠️  Degree of Freedom - Instructions too prescriptive for declared high freedom
✅ SKILL.md Conciseness
🔴 Safety & Failure Handling - Missing error recovery steps
✅ Resource Hygiene
✅ Consistency
⚠️  Testing Guidance - Examples present but no verification steps
✅ Ownership
✅ Tight Scope

## Critical Issues

1. **Missing Failure Handling**: Add error recovery steps for [specific scenario]

## Improvements Needed

1. **Degree of Freedom Mismatch**: Reduce prescriptiveness in steps 3-5 to match high freedom declaration
2. **Testing**: Add quick verification example showing expected output

## Suggestions

- Consider moving detailed API reference to references/api-docs.md
- Example in section 4 could be more concise

## Conclusion

[Overall assessment and recommendation: Approve|Needs Revision|Reject]
```

## Best Practices

### Keep SKILL.md Lean

Move detailed content to references/:
- API documentation → `references/api-docs.md`
- Complex workflows → `references/workflows.md`
- Extensive examples → `references/examples.md`
- Configuration details → `references/configuration.md`

### Verify Progressive Disclosure

Check that information loads in stages:
1. **Metadata** (always): name + description only
2. **Instructions** (when triggered): SKILL.md body
3. **Resources** (as needed): references/ files

### Assess Mental Model

Language should reflect "this is the way":
- ❌ "New recommended approach"
- ❌ "Optional feature"
- ✅ "Use [tool] for [task]"
- ✅ "Standard workflow"

### Match Freedom to Instructions

- **High freedom**: Provide principles, let Claude decide specifics
- **Medium freedom**: Offer preferred patterns with parameters
- **Low freedom**: Specify exact steps for fragile operations

## Examples

For complete review examples with before/after comparisons:
- **[Review Examples](references/examples.md)** - Sample reviews of simple and complex skills

For detailed examples of each quality criterion:
- **[Quality Checklist](references/quality-checklist.md)** - Examples for each of the 10 criteria

## Quick Verification

After completing a review, verify the process worked correctly:

**Checklist**:
- [ ] All reference links in SKILL.md resolve correctly
- [ ] Review report follows the template format
- [ ] Critical issues (🔴) are clearly identified
- [ ] At least one improvement or suggestion provided
- [ ] Checklist results show ✅⚠️🔴 indicators

**Smoke test**: Review a simple skill (e.g., a single-file skill with <500 words) and verify you can:
1. Load the skill and identify its structure
2. Apply all 10 checklist criteria
3. Generate a complete review report
4. Identify at least one area for improvement

**Expected outcome**: A review report that provides actionable feedback and follows the template structure.
