# Git Chain

## Overview

`git chain` manages chains of dependent Git branches where each branch builds upon the previous one (stacked branches). Instead of manually rebasing each branch in sequence, git-chain tracks relationships and updates all branches with a single command.

```
                        I---J---K  feature-2
                       /
              E---F---G  feature-1
             /
A---B---C---D  master
```

When `master` is updated, git-chain rebases `feature-1` onto `master`, then `feature-2` onto `feature-1` automatically.

## When to Use This Skill

Use git-chain when:
- **Stacked PRs**: Working with multiple dependent pull requests that build on each other
- **Feature chains**: Developing a large feature split into incremental branches
- **Review feedback**: Updating base branches requires propagating changes to dependent branches
- **Clean history**: Maintaining linear commit history across dependent branches
- **Avoiding tedious rebasing**: Don't want to manually rebase 3+ branches in sequence

## Prerequisites

**CRITICAL**: Before proceeding, verify that git-chain is installed:

```bash
git chain --version
```

**If git-chain is not installed:**
- **DO NOT** attempt to install it automatically
- **STOP** and inform the user that git-chain is required
- **RECOMMEND** manual installation:

```bash
# From source (requires Rust)
git clone git@github.com:dashed/git-chain.git
cd git-chain
make install

# Or with Cargo
cargo install --path .
```

**If git-chain is not available, exit gracefully and do not proceed with the workflow below.**

## Key Concepts

- **Chain**: A named sequence of branches with dependency order
- **Root Branch**: Foundation branch (typically `main` or `master`) - NOT part of the chain
- **Branch Order**: The sequence in which branches depend on each other

**Important**: A branch can belong to at most one chain.

## Basic Workflow

### Step 1: Set Up a Chain

Create a chain with your stacked branches:

```bash
git chain setup my-feature master feature-1 feature-2 feature-3
```

This creates chain "my-feature" with `master` as root and branches in order: `feature-1` -> `feature-2` -> `feature-3`.

### Step 2: View the Chain

```bash
git chain          # Show current chain (if on a chain branch)
git chain list     # List all chains in the repository
```

### Step 3: Update the Chain

When the root branch or any branch in the chain has new commits:

**Option A: Rebase (rewrites history, clean linear commits)**
```bash
git chain rebase
```

**Option B: Merge (preserves history, creates merge commits)**
```bash
git chain merge
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Stacked PR Workflow

**Scenario**: Working on a feature split into 3 PRs: auth, profiles, settings

```bash
# Create branches
git checkout -b auth main
# ... make auth changes, commit ...
git checkout -b profiles auth
# ... make profile changes, commit ...
git checkout -b settings profiles
# ... make settings changes, commit ...

# Set up the chain
git chain setup user-feature main auth profiles settings

# After main receives new commits, update all branches
git chain rebase
git chain push --force  # Update all PRs
```

### Pattern 2: Review Feedback on Base Branch

**Scenario**: Reviewer requested changes on `auth` branch (first PR)

```bash
git checkout auth
# ... make changes, commit ...

# Update dependent branches automatically
git chain rebase
```

### Pattern 3: Adding a New Branch to Existing Chain

**Scenario**: Need to add `notifications` branch between `profiles` and `settings`

```bash
git checkout -b notifications profiles
# ... make changes, commit ...

# Add to chain with specific position
git chain init user-feature main --after=profiles
```

## Core Commands Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `git chain setup <name> <root> <b1> <b2>...` | Create chain with branches |
| `git chain init <name> <root>` | Add current branch to chain |
| `git chain` | Display current chain |
| `git chain list` | List all chains |
| `git chain rebase` | Rebase all branches (rewrites history) |
| `git chain merge` | Merge all branches (preserves history) |
| `git chain push` | Push all branches to remotes |
| `git chain push --force` | Force push all branches |
| `git chain first/last/next/prev` | Navigate between chain branches |
| `git chain backup` | Create backup branches |
| `git chain prune` | Remove branches merged to root |
| `git chain remove` | Remove current branch from chain |
| `git chain remove --chain` | Delete entire chain |

## Rebase vs Merge

**Use Rebase When:**
- Branches are private/not shared
- You prefer clean, linear history
- PRs haven't been reviewed yet

**Use Merge When:**
- Branches have open PRs with review comments
- You need to preserve commit history
- Collaborating with others on the same branches

## Advanced Usage

For comprehensive coverage of all flags and advanced patterns, see:
- [references/rebase-options.md](references/rebase-options.md) - All rebase flags and conflict handling
- [references/merge-options.md](references/merge-options.md) - All merge flags and strategies
- [references/chain-management.md](references/chain-management.md) - Moving, reorganizing, and removing chains

**Key flags:**
- `--step, -s`: Process one branch at a time (rebase)
- `--ignore-root, -i`: Skip updating first branch from root
- `--verbose, -v`: Detailed output (merge)
- `--chain=<name>`: Operate on specific chain
- `--no-ff`: Force merge commits even for fast-forwards
- `--squashed-merge=<mode>`: Handle squash-merged branches (reset/skip/merge)

## Recovery

If something goes wrong during rebase:

```bash
# Abort in-progress rebase
git rebase --abort

# Restore from backup (if created with git chain backup)
git checkout branch-name
git reset --hard branch-name-backup

# Or use reflog
git reflog
git reset --hard branch-name@{1}
```

## Handling Conflicts

When conflicts occur during `git chain rebase`:

1. Git-chain pauses at the conflicted commit
2. Resolve conflicts manually in the marked files
3. `git add <resolved-files>`
4. `git rebase --continue`
5. `git chain rebase` (continues with remaining branches)

## Troubleshooting

**"Branch not part of any chain"**
- Run `git chain list` to see available chains
- Use `git chain init` to add the current branch to a chain

**"Cannot find fork-point"**
- Reflog may have been cleaned up
- Use `--no-fork-point` flag to fall back to merge-base

**Rebase conflicts on every update**
- Consider using `git chain merge` instead to preserve history
- Or use `--step` flag to handle each branch individually

**Squash-merged branch causing issues**
- git-chain detects squash merges; use `--squashed-merge=skip` to skip them
- Or use `--squashed-merge=reset` (default) to reset branch to parent
