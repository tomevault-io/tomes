# Design Principles

This skill guides AI-assisted UI generation toward enterprise-grade, intentional design rather than producing generic interfaces. It enforces principles inspired by products like Linear, Notion, Stripe, and Vercel.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:

- Building user interfaces or frontend components
- Creating dashboards or admin panels
- Designing enterprise software or SaaS applications
- Generating styled frontend code
- User asks for design help or UI improvements
- Working on any project that needs professional, polished styling

## Key Requirement

**Commit to a design direction before coding.** Choose one personality:

| Direction | Character | Use Case |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Precision & Density | Tight, monochrome, technical | Developer tools |
| Warmth & Approachability | Generous spacing, soft shadows | Consumer SaaS |
| Sophistication & Trust | Cool tones, layered depth | Enterprise finance |
| Boldness & Clarity | High contrast, dramatic space | Modern dashboards |
| Utility & Function | Muted palette, functional density | GitHub-style tools |
| Data & Analysis | Chart-optimized, numbers-first | Analytics platforms |

## Core Craft Principles

**The 4px grid** governs all spacing (4px → 8px → 12px → 16px → 24px → 32px).

**Symmetrical padding** is mandatory: TLBR values must match unless content creates natural visual balance.

**Depth strategy must be intentional and consistent.** Choose borders-only (flat, technical), subtle single shadows, layered shadows (premium), or surface color shifts—then commit completely.

**Typography hierarchy:** Headlines at 600 weight with tight letter-spacing; body at 400–500; scales from 11px to 32px. Monospace exclusively for data.

**Card layouts should vary internally while maintaining consistent surface treatment.** Border weight, shadow depth, corner radius, and padding remain uniform.

## Critical Details

- Use Phosphor Icons; avoid native form elements
- Animation: 150–250ms with cubic-bezier easing (no bounce)
- Color communicates meaning only (status, action, error, success)
- Dark mode requires border emphasis over shadows
- Include navigation context: sidebars, breadcrumbs, or active states

## The Standard

*"Every interface should look designed by a team that obsesses over 1-pixel differences"*—polished, intentional, never defaulted.
