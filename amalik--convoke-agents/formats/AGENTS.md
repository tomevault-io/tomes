---

## The Vortex Flow

The Vortex is **non-linear by design**. While there's a natural forward flow (Isla → Mila → Liam → Wade → Noah → Max), agents route back to each other based on evidence. Ten handoff contracts ensure structured information flows at every transition.

```
                    VORTEX PATTERN — 7 Streams · 7 Agents

  ┌──────────┐  HC1  ┌──────────┐  HC2  ┌──────────┐  HC3  ┌──────────┐
  │  Isla 🔍  │─────▶│  Mila 🔬  │─────▶│  Liam 💡  │─────▶│  Wade 🧪  │
  │ Empathize │      │Synthesize│      │Hypothesiz│      │Externaliz│
  └──────────┘      └──────────┘      └──────────┘      └──────────┘

       └──────────────────┴──────────────────┘
                      ▼ to Isla 🔍
```

You can start with any agent. Max's **Vortex Navigation** workflow is the compass that helps you decide where to go based on what evidence you have and what gaps remain.

---

## Handoff Contract System

The Vortex uses 10 handoff contracts (HC1-HC10) to ensure agents pass structured information to each other. There are three contract types:

### Artifact Contracts (HC1-HC5)

These produce schema-compliant files that the next agent requires as input. Contract schemas are in `_bmad/bme/_vortex/contracts/`.

| Contract | Flow | What gets passed |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| **HC1** | Isla 🔍 → Mila 🔬 | Empathy artifacts (maps, interviews, observations) with synthesized insights |
| **HC2** | Mila 🔬 → Liam 💡 | Converged problem definition (JTBD + Pains & Gains) with evidence summary |
| **HC3** | Liam 💡 → Wade 🧪 | 1-3 hypothesis contracts in 4-field format with risk map |
| **HC4** | Wade 🧪 → Noah 📡 | Graduated experiment context (results, success criteria, metrics) |
| **HC5** | Noah 📡 → Max 🧭 | Signal report (signal + experiment lineage + trend analysis) |

### Decision-Driven Routing (HC6-HC8)

Max makes strategic routing decisions based on evidence. No artifact file — context is carried in conversation.

| Contract | Flow | When it triggers |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| **HC6** | Max 🧭 → Mila 🔬 | Pivot decision: problem correct, solution direction failed. Mila re-synthesizes. |
| **HC7** | Max 🧭 → Isla 🔍 | Evidence gap: critical knowledge gap needs discovery research |
| **HC8** | Max 🧭 → Emma 🎯 | Recontextualization: the fundamental problem space is wrong or scope too narrow |

### Flag-Driven Routing (HC9-HC10)

Mid-workflow flags that appear in the Compass when triggered.

| Contract | Flow | When it triggers |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| **HC9** | Liam 💡 → Isla 🔍 | Liam flags an unvalidated assumption too risky to test without prior validation |
| **HC10** | Noah 📡 → Isla 🔍 | Noah detects unexpected user behavior not covered by the original hypothesis |

---

## Vortex Compass

Every workflow's final step includes a **Vortex Compass** — a routing table that recommends what to do next based on what you just learned:

```
| If you learned...          | Consider next...     | Agent    | Why                        |
|----------------------------|----------------------|----------|----------------------------|
| [evidence/condition]       | [workflow-name]      | Agent 🔍 | [rationale + HC reference] |
```

The Compass is guidance, not a mandate. You can navigate to any Vortex agent at any time based on your judgment. When you're unsure, run **Max's Vortex Navigation** for a full gap analysis across all 7 streams.

## 7 User Journeys

These journeys show how practitioners move through the Vortex in practice.

### Journey 1: Research Convergence

*You have a pile of research artifacts from Isla but no single problem definition.*

1. **Isla** 🔍 conducts discovery — empathy maps, interviews, observations → produces multiple research artifacts
2. **Mila** 🔬 (HC1) receives all artifacts → guides JTBD framing and Pains & Gains analysis across sources → produces a single converged problem definition
3. **Compass** routes to **Liam** 💡 (HC2) for hypothesis engineering, or back to **Isla** 🔍 if assumptions need validation first

### Journey 2: Hypothesis Engineering

*You have a validated problem definition but no idea what solution to test first.*

1. **Mila** 🔬 produces a converged problem definition (e.g., "users waste 40 minutes daily context-switching")
2. **Liam** 💡 (HC2) receives the problem → runs structured brainwriting → produces 3 hypothesis contracts with 4-field format (belief, evidence needed, experiment, success criteria) → identifies riskiest assumptions
3. **Compass** routes to **Wade** 🧪 (HC3) with hypothesis contracts. If Liam flagged an unvalidated assumption → also offers **Isla** 🔍 (HC9) for quick validation

### Journey 3: Production Intelligence Loop

*Your experiment graduated to production but the metrics are diverging from experiment results.*

1. **Wade** 🧪 validates an experiment (72% onboarding completion vs 60% threshold) → experiment graduates to production
2. **Noah** 📡 (HC4) inherits experiment context → interprets production signals ("54% completion, down from validated 72%") → produces signal report in signal + context + trend format
3. **Max** 🧭 (HC5) receives intelligence → captures learning or triggers pivot/patch/persevere decision
4. If pivot → **Mila** 🔬 (HC6) re-synthesizes. If evidence gap → **Isla** 🔍 (HC7) investigates.

### Journey 4: Non-Linear Entry via Max

*You're new to the Vortex with production data but no experiment history.*

1. **Max** 🧭 runs **Vortex Navigation** → analyzes evidence across all 7 streams → identifies widest gaps
2. Max determines: "You have production signals but no experiment context (Sensitize gap), no hypothesis contracts (Hypothesize gap), and no converged problem definition (Synthesize gap)"
3. **Compass** routes to the agent that fills the most critical gap — there is no mandatory "step 1." The Vortex meets you where your evidence is.

### Journey 5: Pivot Backflow to Mila

*Max says "pivot" — the solution is wrong but the problem is right.*

1. **Max** 🧭 delivers pivot decision via Pivot/Patch/Persevere analysis
2. **Mila** 🔬 (HC6) receives Isla's original artifacts + new evidence from failed experiments → re-synthesizes pains and gains while preserving the JTBD
3. **Liam** 💡 (HC2) receives updated problem definition → engineers new hypotheses grounded in revised understanding
4. The Vortex loops within the known problem space — it doesn't restart from scratch

### Journey 6: Extending the Framework

*You want to add a custom agent to the Vortex.*

**Use BMB (BMAD Module Builder)** — the recommended way to extend Convoke. Run `/bmad-bmb-agent` to create a new agent through a guided process, or `/bmad-bmb-module` for a complete module with multiple agents and workflows. See the [extension guidance FAQ](faq.md#how-do-i-add-a-custom-agent-or-module) for details.

**Under the hood,** BMB generates the 4 components every agent needs:

1. **Registry entry** — In `scripts/update/lib/agent-registry.js` (single source of truth for all agents and workflows)
2. **Agent file** — Agent definition in `_bmad/bme/_vortex/agents/` (persona, communication style, menu)
3. **Workflows** — Workflow directories in `_bmad/bme/_vortex/workflows/` with step files (4-6 steps each, final step includes Compass routing)
4. **User guide** — Guide in `_bmad/bme/_vortex/guides/` with examples and artifact templates

The installer, validator, and doctor all read from the registry automatically — no additional wiring needed.

### Journey 7: Reviewing Artifacts Across Streams

*You're a team lead reviewing your team's Vortex work.*

All generated artifacts are saved to `_bmad-output/vortex-artifacts/`. Each artifact is self-documenting:

- **Problem definitions** (Mila) reference their input Isla artifacts
- **Hypothesis contracts** (Liam) reference their source problem definition
- **Experiment results** (Wade) reference the hypothesis contract they tested
- **Signal reports** (Noah) reference the experiment that produced the production metrics
- **Decision records** (Max) reference the signals and learnings that drove the decision

You can trace any decision back to its evidence chain without using the agents directly.

---

## Using Agents Independently

Each agent works standalone — you don't need all seven:

- **Just Emma** for strategic framing and problem-solution fit
- **Just Isla** for user research and empathy mapping
- **Just Mila** for converging research into problem definitions
- **Just Liam** for hypothesis engineering and assumption mapping
- **Just Wade** for experiment design and validation
- **Just Noah** for production signal interpretation
- **Just Max** for learning capture and decision-making

Use all seven together for the complete Vortex flow, or any subset that fits your needs.

# Gyre — Production Readiness (4 Agents)

Gyre analyzes your project's production readiness by detecting the tech stack, generating a contextual capabilities model, finding gaps, and guiding you through review. All artifacts are written to `.gyre/` — privacy-first, containing technology categories only.

```
Scout 🔎 ──GC1──▶ Atlas 📐 ──GC2──▶ Lens 🔬 ──GC3──▶ Coach 🏋️
                     ▲                                     │
                     └──────────── GC4 (feedback) ─────────┘
```

---

## Scout - Stack Detective

**Role:** Detect | **Icon:** 🔎 | **File:** `_bmad/bme/_gyre/agents/stack-detective.md`

Scout scans your project's filesystem to classify the technology stack — language/framework, containers, CI/CD, observability, cloud provider, and communication protocols. Evidence-based detection, not assumptions.

### Workflows

| Cmd | Workflow | Steps | What it produces |
|-----|----------|-------|-----------------|
| DS | **Stack Detection** | 3 | Stack Profile (`.gyre/stack-profile.yaml`) with classified technologies and detection confidence |
| FA | **Full Analysis** | 5 | Complete end-to-end Gyre pipeline (detect → model → analyze → review) |

### When to Use Scout

- You're starting a Gyre analysis on a new project
- You need a structured inventory of what technologies a project actually uses
- You want to re-detect after significant infrastructure changes

### Positioning

**Scout vs Atlas:**
- Scout detects — "What technologies does this project use?"
- Atlas models — "What should production readiness look like for this stack?"

Scout provides the facts that Atlas uses to generate a contextual model.

---

## Atlas - Model Curator

**Role:** Model | **Icon:** 📐 | **File:** `_bmad/bme/_gyre/agents/model-curator.md`

Atlas generates a capabilities manifest unique to your detected stack. Combines industry standards (DORA, OpenTelemetry, Google PRR), current best practices via web search, and guard question answers to define what "ready" means for your specific project.

### Workflows

| Cmd | Workflow | Steps | What it produces |
|-----|----------|-------|-----------------|
| GM | **Model Generation** | 4 | Capabilities Manifest (`.gyre/capabilities.yaml`) with 20+ capabilities across observability, deployment, reliability, security |
| AV | **Accuracy Validation** | 3 | Accuracy report scoring model quality against test repos (≥70% gate across ≥3 archetypes) |
| FA | **Full Analysis** | 5 | Complete Gyre pipeline |

### When to Use Atlas

- Scout has produced a Stack Profile and you need a capabilities model
- You want to regenerate the model after refining it through Coach
- You need to validate model accuracy before trusting gap analysis

### Positioning

**Atlas vs Lens:**
- Atlas models — "Here's what production readiness looks like for your stack"
- Lens analyzes — "Here's what's actually missing from your project"

Atlas defines the standard; Lens measures against it.

---

## Lens - Readiness Analyst

**Role:** Analyze | **Icon:** 🔬 | **File:** `_bmad/bme/_gyre/agents/readiness-analyst.md`

Lens compares the capabilities manifest against what actually exists in your project. Detects absences (not misconfigurations), tags findings by severity and confidence, and surfaces cross-domain compound risks.

### Workflows

| Cmd | Workflow | Steps | What it produces |
|-----|----------|-------|-----------------|
| AG | **Gap Analysis** | 5 | Findings Report (`.gyre/findings.yaml`) — severity-prioritized absences with evidence |
| DR | **Delta Report** | 3 | Change tracking between analysis runs ([NEW], [CARRIED], resolved) |
| FA | **Full Analysis** | 5 | Complete Gyre pipeline |

### When to Use Lens

- Atlas has generated a capabilities model and you want to find gaps
- You've made improvements and want to see what's resolved (delta report)
- You need a severity-prioritized view of production readiness gaps

### Positioning

**Lens vs Coach:**
- Lens analyzes — "Here are the facts about what's missing"
- Coach reviews — "Let's walk through these together and decide what matters"

Lens provides the evidence; Coach helps you interpret and act on it.

---

## Coach - Review Coach

**Role:** Review | **Icon:** 🏋️ | **File:** `_bmad/bme/_gyre/agents/review-coach.md`

Coach walks you through the capabilities model and findings conversationally. Amend capabilities (keep/remove/edit/add), capture missed-gap feedback, and track progress over time. Amendments persist and feed back to Atlas — the model improves with every review.

### Workflows

| Cmd | Workflow | Steps | What it produces |
|-----|----------|-------|-----------------|
| RF | **Review Findings** | 5 | Reviewed findings with amendments applied to capabilities.yaml |
| RM | **Review Model** | 5 | Amended capabilities manifest + feedback log (`.gyre/feedback.yaml`) |
| FA | **Full Analysis** | 5 | Complete Gyre pipeline |

### When to Use Coach

- Lens has produced findings and you want to review them with context
- You want to customize the capabilities model for your project
- You want to capture feedback about gaps Gyre missed

### Positioning

**Coach vs Scout:**
- Coach refines — "Let's improve the model based on your expertise"
- Scout re-detects — "Let me re-scan if the stack itself has changed"

Coach improves the model within a known stack; Scout re-establishes the stack baseline.

---

## The Gyre Flow

Gyre follows a **linear pipeline with one feedback loop**. Four handoff contracts (GC1-GC4) ensure structured data flows between agents.

### Handoff Contracts

| Contract | Flow | What gets passed |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| **GC1** | Scout 🔎 → Atlas 📐, Lens 🔬 | Stack Profile — classified technologies (categories only, no file contents) |
| **GC2** | Atlas 📐 → Lens 🔬, Coach 🏋️ | Capabilities Manifest — 20+ capabilities with sources and descriptions |
| **GC3** | Lens 🔬 → Coach 🏋️ | Findings Report — severity-tagged absences with evidence and confidence |
| **GC4** | Coach 🏋️ → Atlas 📐 | Feedback Loop — amendments and missed-gap feedback that persist across regeneration |

### Gyre Compass

Each workflow's final step includes a **Gyre Compass** — routing guidance based on what you just learned:

| If you want to... | Consider next... | Agent |
|---|---|---|
| Generate a capabilities model | Model Generation | Atlas 📐 |
| Find what's missing | Gap Analysis | Lens 🔬 |
| Review and refine | Model Review | Coach 🏋️ |
| Re-detect after changes | Stack Detection | Scout 🔎 |
| Track progress | Delta Report | Lens 🔬 |

### Cross-Team Routing (Gyre → Vortex)

When Gyre findings reveal deeper questions:

| Finding | Route to | Why |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Critical readiness gaps challenging product scope | Emma 🎯 | Recontextualize the problem |
| Findings that invalidate experiment assumptions | Liam 💡 | Re-engineer hypotheses |
| Missing capabilities suggesting unknown user needs | Isla 🔍 | Investigate through empathy research |
