# CTF Challenge Testing

This skill deploys CTF infrastructure to cloud providers and validates that learners can complete the lab.

## When to Use

- Testing changes to `ctf_setup.sh`, `setup/`, or `verify/`
- Validating challenge setup across AWS, Azure, or GCP
- Running the full contributor-mode test suite before releases
- Verifying services survive VM reboots

## Trigger Examples

Use this skill when the user asks things like:

- "Run a basic test on Azure"
- "Run a basic test on GCP"
- "Run a basic test on AWS"
- "Run a full test on Azure"
- "Run a full test on GCP"
- "Run a full test on AWS"
- "Run a basic test on all providers"
- "Run a full test on all providers"

## Prerequisites

1. **terraform** (>= 1.0)
2. **jq** - Install: `sudo apt install jq` (Ubuntu) or `brew install jq` (macOS)
3. **sshpass** - Install on macOS: `brew install hudochenkov/sshpass/sshpass`
4. **Cloud CLI authenticated** for target provider:
   - AWS: `aws sts get-caller-identity`
   - Azure: `az account show`
   - GCP: `gcloud auth list --filter=status:ACTIVE`

## Agent Workflow

1. **Determine the mode and provider.**
   - Basic test means no reboot. Use this when the user asks for a basic test or does not mention reboot.
   - Full test means reboot. Use this when the user asks for a full test or asks to verify reboot behavior.
   - Provider must be `aws`, `azure`, `gcp`, or `all`. Azure is usually the fastest single-provider test.
2. **Check provider authentication before deploying.**
   - AWS: `aws sts get-caller-identity`
   - Azure: `az account show`
   - GCP: `gcloud auth list --filter=status:ACTIVE`
3. **Run the requested test from the repository root.**

   | User request | Command | What gets tested |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Basic test on AWS | `./.github/skills/ctf-testing/deploy_and_test.sh aws` | Verify command sanity checks, all 18 challenges, export certificate, token format, username, challenge count, and frozen completion time |
   | Basic test on Azure | `./.github/skills/ctf-testing/deploy_and_test.sh azure` | Verify command sanity checks, all 18 challenges, export certificate, token format, username, challenge count, and frozen completion time |
   | Basic test on GCP | `./.github/skills/ctf-testing/deploy_and_test.sh gcp` | Verify command sanity checks, all 18 challenges, export certificate, token format, username, challenge count, and frozen completion time |
   | Basic test on all providers | `./.github/skills/ctf-testing/deploy_and_test.sh all` | Same basic checks across AWS, Azure, and GCP |
   | Full test on AWS | `./.github/skills/ctf-testing/deploy_and_test.sh aws --with-reboot` | Basic checks plus reboot, required service checks, and progress persistence |
   | Full test on Azure | `./.github/skills/ctf-testing/deploy_and_test.sh azure --with-reboot` | Basic checks plus reboot, required service checks, and progress persistence |
   | Full test on GCP | `./.github/skills/ctf-testing/deploy_and_test.sh gcp --with-reboot` | Basic checks plus reboot, required service checks, and progress persistence |
   | Full test on all providers | `./.github/skills/ctf-testing/deploy_and_test.sh all --with-reboot` | Same full checks across AWS, Azure, and GCP |

   The deployment script uses contributor mode, so Terraform uploads the local setup package and runs the code from your working tree. It does not test GitHub Release assets.
4. **Treat cleanup as part of the test, not an optional follow-up.**
   - Verify no test resources remain after the script exits.
   - If resources remain, run provider-specific cleanup or `terraform destroy` from the provider directory.
   - If cleanup still fails, report the remaining resources clearly.
5. **Report the result plainly.**
   - Include provider, mode, pass/fail result, cleanup status, and blocker if any.
   - A successful basic run shows about 27 tests passing.
   - A successful full run includes a second pass after reboot with 5 service checks and 1 progress persistence check.
   - Summary line: `RESULT: PASS (<providers>)` or `RESULT: FAIL (<providers>)`.

## Failure Handling

When a run fails, identify the first failing layer:

| Failure point | What to collect |
| --- | --- |
| Terraform failed | Provider name and Terraform error |
| SSH failed | VM IP and SSH wait output |
| Setup failed | `/var/lib/linux-ctfs/setup.failed`, `/var/log/ctf_setup.log`, and `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log` |
| Challenge failed | Challenge number and failing test output |
| Reboot failed | Failed service name and `journalctl -u <service-name>` output |
| Cleanup failed | Remaining cloud resources |

## CTF Safety Rules

- Do not create committed solution files.
- Keep solution commands only in `.github/skills/ctf-testing/test_ctf_challenges.sh`.
- Do not add flags or challenge solutions to learner-facing docs.
- Do not make challenges easier while fixing tests.

## Scripts

Reference files - treat as black boxes, run directly:

- 📄 [deploy_and_test.sh](deploy_and_test.sh) - Orchestration script (runs locally)
- 📄 [test_ctf_challenges.sh](test_ctf_challenges.sh) - VM test script (copied to and runs on deployed VM)
