# PR Creator

Workflow for creating GitHub Pull Requests. Analyzes changes, writes clear PRs matching the user's query language, and creates them via gh CLI after user confirmation.

**Language Policy:** Always match the user's query language. If the user writes in Korean, write the PR in Korean. If the user writes in English, write the PR in English.

## Workflow

### 0. Create TODO list for tracking

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS start by creating a TODO list using TodoWrite tool.**

Create todos for all workflow steps:

```json
{
  "todos": [
    {"content": "Gather git status", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Gathering git status"},
    {"content": "Analyze changes deeply", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Analyzing changes deeply"},
    {"content": "Extract or ask for ticket ID", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Extracting or asking for ticket ID"},
    {"content": "Write PR title", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Writing PR title"},
    {"content": "Detect PR template", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Detecting PR template"},
    {"content": "Write PR body", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Writing PR body"},
    {"content": "Save PR draft and get user confirmation", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Saving PR draft and getting user confirmation"},
    {"content": "Create PR via gh CLI", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Creating PR via gh CLI"}
  ]
}
```

Update each todo's status to "in_progress" when starting that step, and "completed" when finished.

### 1. Gather git status

Run the parallel git status script to gather all repository information:

```bash
python scripts/get_git_status.py
```

This script executes these commands in parallel using asyncio:
- `git status` - current branch and changes
- `git diff` - unstaged changes
- `git diff --staged` - staged changes
- `git log --oneline -10` - recent commit history
- `git branch --show-current` - current branch name

The script returns JSON output with all results. Parse this to understand the current state.

### 2. Analyze changes deeply

Use ultrathink to analyze:
- What problem was solved?
- What was implemented/added/modified?
- Why was this change needed?
- What technical approach was taken?
- What is the user's core intent to emphasize?

### 3. Extract or ask for ticket ID

**Try to extract ticket ID from branch name first:**

Common patterns to detect:
- `feature/TICKET-123-description` → `TICKET-123`
- `bugfix/PROJ-456-fix-something` → `PROJ-456`
- `feat/ABC-789` → `ABC-789`
- `username/ISSUE-123-description` → `ISSUE-123`

Regular expression pattern: `([A-Z]+-\d+)` or `([A-Z]+\d+)`

**If ticket ID not found in branch name OR user hasn't explicitly mentioned ticket ID:**

Use AskUserQuestion to ask:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "이 작업과 관련된 티켓 ID가 있나요?",
    "header": "티켓 ID",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
      {"label": "있음", "description": "티켓 ID를 입력하세요 (예: TICKET-123)"},
      {"label": "없음", "description": "관련 티켓이 없습니다"}
    ]
  }]
}
```

**If user query is in English:**

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Is there a ticket ID related to this work?",
    "header": "Ticket ID",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
      {"label": "Yes", "description": "Enter ticket ID (e.g., TICKET-123)"},
      {"label": "No", "description": "No related ticket"}
    ]
  }]
}
```

**Skip asking if:**
- User explicitly mentioned ticket ID in their request
- User explicitly said "no ticket" or "티켓 없음"

### 4. Write PR title

**Format:**
- **If ticket ID exists**: `[TICKET-ID] {descriptive title}`
- **If no ticket ID**: `{descriptive title}`

**Required rules:**
- **Ticket ID prefix**: If ticket ID was found or provided, add `[TICKET-ID]` at the start
- **Noun form ending**: End with noun form in the user's query language
- **Specific and clear**: Immediately understandable
- **Emphasize core**: Reflect what the user wants to highlight
- **Around 50-60 characters** (excluding ticket ID prefix): Keep concise but informative

**Prohibited:**
- NO conventional commit prefixes (`fix:`, `feat:`, `refactor:`)
- NO vague expressions like "bug fix", "improvement"
- NO technical term lists only

**Good examples:**
- "[PROJ-123] Fix dmypy incorrectly inferring all Django models as Reel type"
- "[ISSUE-456] Implement Instagram Reels bulk collection API"
- "[TICKET-789] Improve response speed by adding search result caching"
- "Fix dmypy incorrectly inferring all Django models as Reel type" (no ticket)

**Bad examples:**
- "[PROJ-123] fix: type error"
- "[ISSUE-456] bug fix"
- "performance improvement"
- "PROJ-123: Fix type error" (wrong format - must use brackets)

### 5. Detect PR template

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS run the PR template detection script. DO NOT skip this step.**

**You MUST run this Python script to detect PR templates:**

```bash
python scripts/detect_pr_template.py
```

**Why this is critical:**
- Each repository may have its own PR template structure
- Using the repository's template ensures consistency with team conventions
- The script handles git worktree environments correctly
- Skipping this step results in incorrect PR format

**What the script does:**
- Searches for PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md in standard locations (.github/, docs/, root)
- Works correctly in git worktree environments
- Returns JSON with template path and content if found

**IMPORTANT: You must parse the JSON output and follow the instructions:**
- If `"found": true` → **USE THE TEMPLATE STRUCTURE** from `"content"` field. DO NOT use fallback structure.
- If `"found": false` → Use the fallback structure below

**Example output when found:**
```json
{
  "found": true,
  "path": ".github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md",
  "content": "## Description\n\n## Changes\n..."
}
```

**What to do:** Extract the `"content"` field and use that exact structure for the PR body.

### 6. Write PR body

**If template found:** Follow the repository's template structure exactly. Fill in each section based on the analyzed changes.

**If template not found (fallback):** Use the structure matching the user's query language.

**Structure template:**
```markdown
## Background
{Explain why this work was needed. Describe the problem situation or requirements specifically}

## Changes
{Describe what and how things were changed. Include technical approach}
- List major changes as bullet points
- Balance technical details with understandable explanations

## Testing
{How to verify this PR works properly. Omit this section if not applicable}
1. Specific test steps
2. Expected results
3. Commands to run automated tests if available

## Review Notes
{Parts that reviewers should pay special attention to or additional context. Omit if not applicable}
- Areas of special focus
- Potential risks or trade-offs
- Future improvement opportunities

## Screenshots
{If there are UI changes or visual demonstrations. Omit if not applicable}
```

**Note:** Write the entire PR content in the same language as the user's query. If the user writes in Korean, use Korean section titles and content. If in English, use English.

### 7. Save PR draft

Save the draft to a temporary file:

```bash
/tmp/pull-request-{topic}-{timestamp}.md
```

Show the content to the user and ask for confirmation in their language.

### 8. Create PR

**Only proceed after user approval.**

1. Check for uncommitted changes:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. If needed, create new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b {username}/{branch-name}
   ```

3. If there are unstaged changes, create commit (use existing git commit workflow)

4. Push to remote:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin {branch-name}
   ```

5. Create PR using gh CLI:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "{title}" --body "$(cat /tmp/pull-request-{topic}-{timestamp}.md)" --base main
   ```

6. Return PR URL to user

## Key considerations

**User intent understanding:**
- Identify what the user wants to emphasize
- Focus on business value or problem solving over technical achievement
- Clearly communicate "why this is important"

**Balance technical accuracy and readability:**
- Use technical terms precisely, but add context
- Wrap code changes in backticks
- Add simple analogies or explanations for complex concepts

**Reviewer perspective:**
- Structure for quick understanding
- Emphasize important changes
- Provide clear testing methods

## Prohibited actions

- NO conventional commit prefixes in PR title
- NO vague or generic descriptions
- NO technical term lists only
- NO PR creation without user confirmation
- NO PR creation with uncommitted changes

## Final checklist

Before creating PR, verify:
- [ ] Title matches user's query language?
- [ ] Title is specific and clear?
- [ ] Body follows the required structure?
- [ ] Balance between technical details and explanations is appropriate?
- [ ] User's core intent is well communicated?
- [ ] All changes are committed?
- [ ] User confirmation received?
