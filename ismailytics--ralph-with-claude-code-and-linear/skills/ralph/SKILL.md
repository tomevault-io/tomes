# Ralph PRD to Linear Converter

Converts existing PRD markdown files to Linear projects and issues for autonomous execution by Ralph.

**Prerequisites:** Linear MCP must be configured. See https://linear.app/docs/mcp

---

## The Job

1. Read the PRD markdown file provided by the user
2. Parse user stories and requirements
3. Select a Linear team (interactively)
4. Create a Linear project with PRD content
5. Create Linear issues for each user story
6. Save `.ralph-project` configuration

---

## Step 1: Parse the PRD

Read the PRD file and extract:
- **Title/Name** from `# PRD: [Name]` or first heading
- **Description/Overview** from Introduction section
- **Goals** from Goals section
- **User Stories** from User Stories section (parse US-XXX format)
- **Non-Goals** from Non-Goals section
- **Technical Considerations** from that section

---

## Step 2: Select Linear Team

Use `mcp__linear-server__list_teams` to get available teams and ask the user which team to use.

---

## Step 3: Create Linear Project

Use `mcp__linear-server__create_project`:

```json
{
  "name": "<PRD Title>",
  "team": "<team-id-or-name>",
  "description": "Branch: ralph/<feature-kebab-case>\n\n<Full PRD content as markdown>",
  "state": "planned"
}
```

**Critical:** The first line of the description MUST be `Branch: ralph/<feature-name>` for Ralph to identify the correct git branch.

---

## Step 4: Create Issues from User Stories

For each `### US-XXX:` section in the PRD:

1. Extract title (text after `US-XXX:`)
2. Extract description (the "As a..." line)
3. Extract acceptance criteria (the `- [ ]` items)
4. Map position to priority (1st=Urgent, 2nd=High, etc.)

Create issue using `mcp__linear-server__create_issue`:

```json
{
  "title": "US-001: <Title>",
  "team": "<team-id-or-name>",
  "project": "<project-id-or-name>",
  "description": "<As a... description>\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n<Criteria as checklist>",
  "priority": 1,
  "state": "Todo"
}
```

### Priority Mapping

| PRD Story Position | Linear Priority |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| 1 (first)          | 1 (Urgent)      |
| 2                  | 2 (High)        |
| 3                  | 3 (Normal)      |
| 4+                 | 4 (Low)         |

---

## Step 5: Save Configuration

Create `.ralph-project` in the Ralph directory:

```json
{
  "linearProjectId": "<project-id>",
  "branchName": "ralph/<feature-name>"
}
```

---

## Story Size: The Number One Rule

**Each story must be completable in ONE Ralph iteration (one context window).**

Ralph spawns a fresh Claude Code instance per iteration with no memory of previous work. If a story is too big, the LLM runs out of context before finishing and produces broken code.

### Right-sized stories:
- Add a database column and migration
- Add a UI component to an existing page
- Update a server action with new logic
- Add a filter dropdown to a list

### Too big (split these):
- "Build the entire dashboard" - Split into: schema, queries, UI components, filters
- "Add authentication" - Split into: schema, middleware, login UI, session handling
- "Refactor the API" - Split into one story per endpoint or pattern

**Rule of thumb:** If you cannot describe the change in 2-3 sentences, it is too big.

---

## Story Ordering: Dependencies First

Stories execute in priority order. Earlier stories must not depend on later ones.

**Correct order:**
1. Schema/database changes (migrations)
2. Server actions / backend logic
3. UI components that use the backend
4. Dashboard/summary views that aggregate data

**Wrong order:**
1. UI component (depends on schema that does not exist yet)
2. Schema change

---

## Acceptance Criteria: Must Be Verifiable

Each criterion must be something Ralph can CHECK, not something vague.

### Good criteria (verifiable):
- "Add `status` column to tasks table with default 'pending'"
- "Filter dropdown has options: All, Active, Completed"
- "Clicking delete shows confirmation dialog"
- "Typecheck passes"
- "Tests pass"

### Bad criteria (vague):
- "Works correctly"
- "User can do X easily"
- "Good UX"
- "Handles edge cases"

### Always include as final criterion:
```
"Typecheck passes"
```

For stories with testable logic, also include:
```
"Tests pass"
```

### For stories with testable business logic (optional):
```
"Tests written first (TDD)"
```
Use this when the story involves complex logic, algorithms, or API contracts that benefit from test-first development.

### For stories that change UI, also include:
```
"Verify in browser"
```
(The agent will auto-select Playwright MCP or dev-browser based on availability)

## Validation Before Creating

Before creating in Linear, verify:

- [ ] Each story is completable in one iteration (small enough)
- [ ] Stories are ordered by dependency (schema → backend → UI)
- [ ] Every story has "Typecheck passes" as criterion
- [ ] UI stories have "Verify in browser"
- [ ] Stories with complex logic considered for "Tests written first (TDD)"
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are verifiable (not vague)
- [ ] No story depends on a later story

If stories are too big, split them before creating issues.

---

## Output Summary

After creating everything, show the user:

```
Converted PRD to Linear:

Project: <Project Name>
ID: <uuid>
Branch: ralph/<feature-name>

Issues Created:
- <TEAM>-123: US-001: <Title> (Urgent)
- <TEAM>-124: US-002: <Title> (High)
- <TEAM>-125: US-003: <Title> (Normal)
- <TEAM>-126: US-004: <Title> (Low)

Saved .ralph-project configuration.

To start Ralph:
  ./ralph.sh [max_iterations]
```

---

## Example

**Input:** `tasks/prd-task-status.md`

**Creates:**
1. **Linear Project:** "Task Status Feature"
   - Description contains full PRD with `Branch: ralph/task-status` on first line

2. **Linear Issues:**
   - `TEAM-45`: US-001: Add status field to tasks table (Urgent)
   - `TEAM-46`: US-002: Display status badge on task cards (High)
   - `TEAM-47`: US-003: Add status toggle to task list rows (Normal)
   - `TEAM-48`: US-004: Filter tasks by status (Low)

3. **Local file:** `.ralph-project` with project ID and branch name

---

## Splitting Large PRDs

If a PRD has big features, split them:

**Original:**
> "Add user notification system"

**Split into:**
1. US-001: Add notifications table to database
2. US-002: Create notification service for sending notifications
3. US-003: Add notification bell icon to header
4. US-004: Create notification dropdown panel
5. US-005: Add mark-as-read functionality
6. US-006: Add notification preferences page

Each is one focused change that can be completed and verified independently.
