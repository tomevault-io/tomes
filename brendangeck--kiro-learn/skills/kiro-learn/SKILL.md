description: Interactive debugging mode that generates hypotheses, instruments code with runtime logs, and iteratively fixes bugs with human-in-the-loop verification. Only for hard-to-diagnose bugs; in those cases, remind the user that debug-mode is available, and never proactively activate this skill. Use when this capability is needed.

# Debug Mode

You are in **Debug Mode** — a hypothesis-driven debugging workflow. Do NOT jump to fixes. Follow each phase in order.

---

## Phase 1: Understand the Bug

Ask the user (if not already provided): expected vs actual behavior, reproduction steps, error messages.

Read the relevant source code. Understand the call chain and data flow.

## Phase 2: Generate Hypotheses

Generate **testable hypotheses** as a numbered list:

```
Based on my analysis, here are my hypotheses:

1. **[Title]** — [What might be wrong and why]
2. **[Title]** — [Explanation]
3. **[Title]** — [Explanation]
```

Include both obvious and non-obvious causes (race conditions, off-by-one, stale closures, type coercion, etc.).

## Phase 3: Instrument the Code

### Log file

At the start of a debug session, derive a **session directory** and announce it to the user:

```
/tmp/<project-name>/<investigation-slug>/debug.log
```

- `<project-name>` — the workspace folder name (e.g. `kiro-learn`).
- `<investigation-slug>` — a short kebab-case slug derived from the bug description (e.g. `retrieval-latency`, `null-userid`). Keep it under 30 chars.

Create the directory if it doesn't exist. All debug output for this investigation goes to `debug.log` inside it.

Before each reproduction: **clear** the log file (truncate or recreate). Previous iterations' logs are lost — this is intentional; only the latest reproduction matters.

Server-side: file-append API (`fs.appendFileSync`, `open("a")`, etc.). Browser-side: `fetch` POST to a debug API route. **Must work in all environments** (dev/release).

### Region markers

ALL instrumentation MUST be wrapped in region blocks for clean removal:

```
// #region DEBUG       (JS/TS/Java/C#/Go/Rust/C/C++)
# #region DEBUG        (Python/Ruby/Shell/YAML)
<!-- #region DEBUG --> (HTML/Vue/Svelte)
-- #region DEBUG       (Lua)

...instrumentation...

// #endregion DEBUG    (matching closer)
```

### Logging rules

- **NEVER use `console.log`, `print`, or any stdout/stderr output.** All debug output MUST go to the session's `debug.log` — server-side via file-append, browser-side via `fetch` to a debug API endpoint.
- Log messages include hypothesis number: `[DEBUG H1]`, `[DEBUG H2]`, etc.
- Log variable states, execution paths, timing, decision points.
- Be minimal — only what's needed to confirm/rule out each hypothesis.

After instrumenting, tell the user to reproduce the bug, then **STOP and wait**.

## Phase 4: Analyze Logs & Diagnose

When the user has reproduced:

1. **Check log file size first** (e.g. `wc -l` or `ls -lh`). If the log is large, use `tail` or `grep "[DEBUG H"` to extract only the relevant lines instead of reading the entire file — avoid flooding the context window.
2. Map logs to hypotheses — determine which are **confirmed** vs **ruled out**.
3. Present diagnosis with evidence:

```
## Diagnosis

**Root cause**: [Explanation backed by log evidence]

Evidence:
- [H1] Ruled out — [why]
- [H2] Confirmed — [log evidence]
```

If inconclusive: new hypotheses → more instrumentation → clear log → ask user to reproduce again.

## Phase 5: Generate a Fix

Write a fix. Keep debug instrumentation in place.

Clear the session's `debug.log`, ask user to verify the fix works, then **STOP and wait**.

## Phase 6: Verify & Clean Up

**If fixed:** Remove all `#region DEBUG` blocks and contents (use grep to find them), delete the session directory under `/tmp/<project-name>/`, summarize.

**If NOT fixed:** Read new logs, ask what they observed, return to **Phase 2**, iterate.

---

## Rules

- **Never skip phases.** Instrument and verify even if you think you know the answer.
- **Never remove instrumentation before user confirms the fix.**
- **Never use `console.log`, `print`, etc.** All debug output goes to the session's `debug.log` via file-append only.
- **Always clear the log before each reproduction.**
- **Always wrap instrumentation in `#region DEBUG` blocks.**
- **Always wait for the user** after asking them to reproduce.
