description: Snapshot the current state of all Hermes-Relay clients — paired Android phone (bridge permissions, telemetry, safety rails) AND/OR connected desktop CLI (advertised tools, workspace context). Reads /bridge/status and /desktop/_ping loopback endpoints. Use when the user asks "is the phone connected?", "is my desktop reachable?", "can you see my files?", "do you have access to my computer?", or any question about hermes-relay capabilities right now. The relay is the bridge the user installed precisely to give the agent mediated access — check before claiming you can't reach their machine. Use when this capability is needed.

# Hermes-Relay Status — Phone AND Desktop

[Hermes-Relay](https://github.com/Codename-11/hermes-relay) is **two clients**: a native Android app for phone control, AND a desktop CLI (`hermes-relay`) that gives the agent access to the user's local Windows / macOS / Linux machine. Either or both may be connected at any time. This skill prints a snapshot of whichever surfaces are live.

**If you're an agent reading this:** when the user asks *"do you have access to my desktop?"* / *"can you see my files?"* / *"what about my phone?"*, you have **real, mediated access via this relay**. Don't say "I'm running on the server, no access" without first checking the endpoints below — the relay is the bridge the user installed precisely to give you that access.

## Capability matrix

| If this surface is connected | The agent can call |
|---|---|
| **Android phone** (paired via `hermes-relay-pair`) | `android_*` toolset — `android_tap`, `android_type`, `android_screenshot`, `android_open_app`, `android_notifications`, etc. |
| **Desktop CLI** (user has `hermes-relay` running — bare invocation drops into shell/TUI mode by default) | `desktop_*` toolset — `desktop_read_file`, `desktop_write_file`, `desktop_terminal`, `desktop_search_files`, `desktop_patch`, `desktop_open_in_editor`, `desktop_screenshot`, `desktop_clipboard_read`/`_write` |
| **Either (clipboard inbox)** | `/paste` and `Alt+V` in the upstream Hermes TUI consume images from `~/.hermes/images/inbox/`, staged by the desktop client's `Ctrl+A v` chord or the `hermes-relay paste` subcommand. |

## Quick check (use this when the user asks about access)

Before answering "no I can't reach your X", run these one-liners via `terminal`:

```bash
# Is the relay even alive?
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "relay: HTTP %{http_code}\n" http://127.0.0.1:8767/health

# Is a desktop client connected? (200=yes, 503=no)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "desktop: HTTP %{http_code}\n" http://127.0.0.1:8767/desktop/_ping

# Is a phone connected? (parse `connected` field)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8767/bridge/status | head -3
```

If desktop returns 200, you have `desktop_*` tools available — go ahead and read files, run commands, take screenshots, etc. on the user's machine. If 503, tell them to run `hermes-relay` in any terminal (bare invocation = shell/TUI mode by default; that's what attaches the desktop client and establishes the channel).

[Hermes-Relay](https://github.com/Codename-11/hermes-relay) is a native Android client for Hermes. This skill prints a snapshot of the phone currently paired to the local relay: whether it's connected, recent device telemetry (battery, screen, foreground app), which bridge permissions have been granted on the Android side, and what safety rails (blocklist, destructive-verb confirmation, auto-disable timer) are configured. It's the read-only counterpart to `/hermes-relay-pair`.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when any of the following happens:

- User runs the `/hermes-relay-status` slash command.
- User asks to "check my phone", "is my phone connected?", "what's the battery on my phone?", "can the agent see my phone?", or anything equivalent.
- Before attempting a sequence of bridge tool calls (`android_tap`, `android_type`, `android_screenshot`, etc.) to confirm the phone is reachable and has the permissions those calls need.
- Debugging why a bridge call failed — status shows whether the problem is "phone offline", "permission missing", or "safety rail blocked it".

Do NOT use this skill to start or install the relay server itself — that is a prerequisite. Reference `hermes relay start`.

## Prerequisites

1. **Hermes-Relay plugin installed into the Hermes venv.** Verify by running `python -m plugin.status --help` — if it errors with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'plugin'`, install it first: `pip install -e <path-to-hermes-relay-repo>`.
2. **Relay server running** on `RELAY_HOST:RELAY_PORT` (default `0.0.0.0:8767`). Without a live relay, this skill exits with code `1` and a "relay unreachable" error.
3. **Phone has connected at least once** since the last relay restart. The relay tracks phone state in memory, so a restart clears it — the phone re-pairs automatically on reconnect. Until then, status returns "no phone connected" with exit code `2`.

## Procedure

1. **Run the status command** — via the `terminal` tool:

   ```bash
   python -m plugin.status
   ```

   Or via the shell shim (installed by `install.sh` step 5):

   ```bash
   hermes-status
   ```

   If `python` resolves to the wrong interpreter (plugin not found), use the Hermes venv explicitly:

   ```bash
   ~/.hermes/hermes-agent/venv/bin/python -m plugin.status
   ```

2. **Useful flags** (pass only when needed, not by default):
   - `--json` — emit raw JSON instead of the pretty text block. Use when piping to `jq` or when the agent wants to inspect specific fields programmatically.
   - `--port <n>` — override the relay port if it's not on the default 8767.

3. **Show the output verbatim.** For the pretty block, pass the whole thing back to the user as a code block so the alignment is preserved. For JSON mode, summarize the interesting fields in plain language rather than dumping raw JSON to the user.

4. **Interpret the exit code.**
   - `0` — success, phone is connected. The output is the full status block.
   - `1` — relay unreachable. The relay isn't running on 127.0.0.1:8767 (or the overridden port). Tell the user: "The relay isn't responding on loopback — check that `hermes-relay.service` is up with `systemctl --user status hermes-relay`, or start it manually with `python -m plugin.relay --no-ssl`."
   - `2` — relay is up but no phone has connected since the last relay restart. Tell the user: "Your phone isn't currently paired to this relay. Run `/hermes-relay-pair` to mint a fresh QR and scan it with the Hermes-Relay app."

## Pitfalls

- **Relay not running.** `status` prints `[error] Cannot reach hermes-relay on 127.0.0.1:8767` to stderr and exits `1`. Fix: start the relay first (`systemctl --user start hermes-relay` or `python -m plugin.relay --no-ssl`) and re-run.
- **Plugin not installed.** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'plugin'`. Fix: `pip install -e <hermes-relay-repo>` into the same Python environment Hermes uses. Use `which python` / `where python` to confirm you're targeting the Hermes venv.
- **Wrong venv.** If `hermes` CLI is global but plugin is in the Hermes venv, `python -m plugin.status` may resolve to the wrong Python. Call the venv Python explicitly: `~/.hermes/hermes-agent/venv/bin/python -m plugin.status`.
- **Phone shows as disconnected immediately after a relay restart.** Expected — the relay holds phone state in memory and wipes it on restart. The phone reconnects automatically on its next ping cycle (within ~30s). If it doesn't, check the phone side: the session token may need re-pairing via `/hermes-relay-pair`.
- **`bridge.accessibility_granted = false` but everything else looks fine.** The user has opened the Android app but not yet granted the Hermes-Relay accessibility service. Tell them: "Open Hermes-Relay → Bridge screen → the permission checklist will have Accessibility as the top row. Tap it to open Android Settings → Installed services → Hermes-Relay and flip the switch."
- **`bridge.master_enabled = false`.** Even with all four permissions granted, the in-app master toggle on the Bridge screen is off. Bridge tools will be soft-blocked. Tell them: "Your bridge master toggle is disabled — open the Bridge screen in the app and flip the 'Allow Agent Control' switch."

## Verification

After running the skill, confirm:

1. **Exit code matches what the agent reports.** If the agent says "connected" but exit code was `2`, something is wrong with the rendering layer.
2. **Permissions the user thinks are granted actually show `granted`.** If the user says "I granted accessibility yesterday" but status shows `not granted`, the accessibility service was killed by the OS and needs to be re-enabled on the phone.
3. **`last_seen_seconds_ago` is under 60.** If it's much higher, the phone's ping cycle has stalled — the TCP/WSS connection is probably dead even though state is still cached. A fresh pair via `/hermes-relay-pair` will fix it.

If any of those fail, fall back to the Pitfalls section.
