# Inbox - Read Inter-Agent Messages

Check and read messages sent to this session's inbox from other agents or sessions.

## When to Use

- Another agent mentions sending a message
- Starting work on a task that may have been handed off
- Coordinating with other Claude sessions
- Checking for pending messages or recent communications

## How It Works

Each hive session has a unique inbox topic (`agent.<id>.inbox`). Other agents publish messages to this inbox, readable via the commands below.

By default, messages are NOT marked as read. Use `--ack` to acknowledge messages.

## Commands

### Read Unread Messages (Default)

```bash
hive msg inbox
```

Shows unread messages without marking them as read.

### Read and Acknowledge

```bash
hive msg inbox --ack
```

Shows unread messages and marks them as read so they won't appear again.

### Read All Messages

```bash
hive msg inbox --all
```

Shows all messages (read and unread).

### Specify Session Explicitly

```bash
hive msg inbox --session <id|name>
```

Overrides auto-detection from working directory. Useful when running outside a session directory.

### Wait for a Message

```bash
hive msg inbox --wait
hive msg inbox --wait --timeout 2m
```

Blocks until a message arrives. Default timeout is 24h for wait mode.

### Poll for New Messages

```bash
hive msg inbox --listen --timeout 30s
```

Continuously polls and outputs new messages until timeout.

### Limit Results

```bash
hive msg inbox --tail 5
```

Returns only the last N unread messages.

## Output Format

All output is JSON Lines (one JSON object per line) on stdout. Fields:
- `id` - Unique message identifier
- `topic` - The inbox topic (`agent.<id>.inbox`)
- `payload` - The message text
- `sender` - Who sent the message (session ID or custom sender)
- `session_id` - Sender's session ID (if auto-detected)
- `created_at` - ISO 8601 timestamp

On timeout (`--listen`/`--wait`), a JSON status line is printed and exit code is 1.

## Common Workflows

### Basic Message Check

```bash
hive msg inbox
```

Read and act on any unread messages.

### Handle Coordinated Handoff

When another agent hands off work:

```bash
# Check inbox for handoff message
hive msg inbox

# Read referenced task details
bd show <issue-id>
```

### Review Message History

```bash
hive msg inbox --all
```
