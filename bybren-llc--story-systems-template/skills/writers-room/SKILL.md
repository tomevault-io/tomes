# Writer's Room Skill

## Purpose

A collaborative pre-production workflow where multiple specialized agents pitch their creative visions before any writing begins. This creates diverse perspectives, healthy creative tension, and a synthesized approach that draws from the best ideas.

## When to Use

- Before starting a new screenplay or major rewrite
- When reimagining existing material
- When the creative direction is uncertain
- When you want multiple expert perspectives before committing

## Participants

The Writer's Room convenes 6 specialized agents, each with a distinct role:

### Story Architect
**Focus:** Structure and form
- Alternative three-act structures
- Non-linear possibilities
- Scene sequence options
- Climax variations
- Pacing strategies

### Story Analyst
**Focus:** Character and meaning
- Character arc potential
- Thematic depth opportunities
- Aristotle's Six Components evaluation
- What the story is *really* about
- Theophrastus archetype analysis

### Dialogue Writer
**Focus:** Voice and tone
- Character voice distinctions
- Comedic/dramatic rhythm
- Language approach (profanity, dialect, period)
- Signature lines and moments
- Subtext opportunities

### Scene Writer
**Focus:** Visual storytelling
- Key visual setpieces
- Physical comedy/action beats
- Power dynamics per scene
- Compression opportunities
- "Show don't tell" moments

### Standards Reviewer
**Focus:** Quality and originality
- What makes each proposed element A-grade?
- Weak points to avoid
- Cliche identification
- Fresh vs. derivative analysis
- Genre boundary awareness

### Research Specialist
**Focus:** Authenticity and grounding
- Setting accuracy requirements
- Technical/professional accuracy
- Historical or cultural considerations
- Real-world logic checks
- Reference material needs

## Process

### Step 1: Brief the Room
Provide all participants with:
- The core premise/logline
- Any existing material (V1 script, source material, notes)
- Target tone and audience
- Constraints (runtime, budget considerations, rating)
- What's "sacred" vs. open for reimagining

### Step 2: Individual Pitches
Each agent prepares their perspective:
- What excites them about the material
- Their proposed approach
- Specific recommendations
- Potential concerns or warnings

### Step 3: Synthesis
Combine the best elements from all pitches into:
- A unified creative direction
- Key scenes that must exist
- Tone and voice guidelines
- What's explicitly off-limits
- The "North Star" for the project
