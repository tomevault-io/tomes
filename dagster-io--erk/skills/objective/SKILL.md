# Objective Skill

## Overview

Objectives are coordination documents for goals requiring multiple plans/PRs to complete. Unlike
erk-prs (single executable implementations), objectives track progress across related work and
capture lessons learned along the way.

**Scope range:**

- Small: Feature requiring 2-3 related PRs
- Medium: Refactor spanning several plans
- Large: Long-running strategic direction emitting many plans

## Objective vs Erk-Plan

| Aspect   | Erk-Plan                         | Objective                           |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Purpose  | Single executable implementation | Coordinate 2+ related plans/PRs     |
| Scope    | One PR or tightly-coupled change | Multiple plans toward coherent goal |
| Body     | Machine-parseable metadata       | Human-readable markdown             |
| Comments | Session context dumps            | Action logs + lessons               |
| Label    | `erk-pr`                         | `erk-objective`                     |
| Tooling  | `erk pr dispatch/implement`      | Manual updates via comments         |

## Key Design Principles

1. **Human-first** - Plain markdown, no machine-generated metadata
2. **Incremental capture** - Each action gets its own comment
3. **Lessons as first-class** - Every action comment includes lessons learned
4. **Clear roadmap** - Status visible at a glance in the body
5. **Body stays current via reconciliation** - After every PR landing, agents audit prose sections against what was actually implemented and correct stale information
6. **Steelthread-first** - Each phase starts with minimal vertical slice proving the concept works
7. **One PR per phase** - Each phase is sized for a coherent single PR
8. **Always shippable** - System remains functional after each merged PR
9. **Body is source of truth** - Body always contains complete current state; comments are the changelog
10. **Two-step for all changes** - Every addition (context, decisions, phases) gets a comment AND body update
11. **Context over code** - Provide references to patterns, not prescriptive implementations
12. **Session handoff ready** - Body should be self-contained for any session to pick up and implement

## Quick Reference

### Creating an Objective

```bash
gh issue create --title "Objective: [Title]" --label "erk-objective" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
# Objective: [Title]

> [1-2 sentence summary]

## Goal

[What success looks like - concrete end state]

## Design Decisions

1. **[Decision name]**: [What was decided]

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: [Name] Steelthread (1 PR)

Minimal vertical slice proving the concept works.

| Node | Description | Status | PR |
|------|-------------|--------|-----|
| 1.1 | [Minimal infrastructure] | pending | |
| 1.2 | [Wire into one command] | pending | |

**Test:** [End-to-end acceptance test for steelthread]

### Phase 2: Complete [Name] (1 PR)

Fill out remaining functionality.

| Node | Description | Status | PR |
|------|-------------|--------|-----|
| 2.1 | [Extend to remaining commands] | pending | |
| 2.2 | [Full test coverage] | pending | |

**Test:** [Full acceptance criteria]

EOF
)"
```

### Logging an Action

Post an action comment after completing work. See [format.md](references/format.md#action-comment-template) for full template.

```bash
gh issue comment <issue-number> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Action: [Brief title]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD | **PR:** #123 | **Phase/Node:** 1.2
### What Was Done
### Lessons Learned
### Roadmap Updates
EOF
)"
```

After posting, update the issue body (roadmap statuses, reconcile stale prose sections).

### Updating Node Details

Update node description, slug, or reason using `update-objective-node`:

```bash
# Update description
erk exec update-objective-node 8470 --node 1.3 --description "Revised description"

# Set slug
erk exec update-objective-node 8470 --node 1.3 --slug "revised-slug"

# Skip with comment
erk exec update-objective-node 8470 --node 1.3 --status skipped --comment "Superseded by new approach"

# Combine multiple updates
erk exec update-objective-node 8470 --node 2.1 --description "New desc" --slug "new-slug" --status planning
```

### Adding Nodes

Add new nodes to an existing objective's roadmap:

```bash
# Add to existing phase (auto-assigns next ID, e.g., 1.4)
erk exec add-objective-node 8470 --phase 1 --description "Clean up dead code"

# With explicit slug and dependencies
erk exec add-objective-node 8470 --phase 2 \
  --description "Integration tests" \
  --slug integration-tests \
  --depends-on 2.1 --depends-on 2.2

# With comment for adding
erk exec add-objective-node 8470 --phase 1 \
  --description "Handle edge case" \
  --comment "Discovered during re-evaluation"
```

### Updating Node Status

Always use the programmatic command — never manually edit YAML or prose tables:

```bash
erk exec update-objective-node <issue> --node <id> --status <status>
erk exec update-objective-node <issue> --node <id> --pr '#1234'
```

Then validate: `erk objective check <issue-number>`

### Viewing an Objective

View an objective's dependency graph, dependencies, and next node:

```bash
# CLI
erk objective view <issue-number>

# Slash command (in-session)
/local:objective-view <issue-number>
```

### Spawning an Erk-Plan

To implement a specific roadmap node, create an erk-pr that references the objective:

```bash
erk pr create --file plan.md --title "Implement [node description]"
```

## Workflow Summary

1. **Create objective** - When starting multi-plan work
2. **Inspect progress** - View dependency graph and next node
3. **Log actions** - After completing each significant piece of work
4. **Update body** - Keep roadmap status current, reconcile stale prose after each PR landing
5. **Spawn erk-prs** - For individual implementation nodes
6. **Close** - When goal achieved or abandoned (proactively ask when all nodes done)
