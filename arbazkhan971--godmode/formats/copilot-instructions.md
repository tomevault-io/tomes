# Godmode for Gemini CLI

@./skills/godmode/SKILL.md
@./skills/principles/SKILL.md

## Verify Installation

After running the install script, confirm everything is set up correctly:

```bash
bash adapters/gemini/verify.sh
```

This checks that Gemini CLI can find the Godmode configuration, skill files, and agent definitions. If any check fails, the script reports what is missing and how to fix it.

## Tool Mapping

Gemini CLI tools map to Godmode skill references as follows:

| Skill Reference | Gemini Tool |
|---|---|
| Read | `read_file` |
| Write | `write_file` |
| Edit | `replace` |
| Bash | `run_shell_command` |
| Grep | `grep_search` |
| Glob | `glob` |
| TodoWrite | `write_todos` |
| Skill | `activate_skill` |

When a skill says "use Read to examine the file," use `read_file`. When it says "use Bash to run tests," use `run_shell_command`. Apply this mapping throughout.

## How to Use Skills

Godmode has **126 skills** and **7 subagents**. The orchestrator (`/godmode`) auto-detects which to invoke. Users can also invoke directly: `/godmode:skillname`.

**When a user invokes a skill** (e.g., `/godmode:secure`), read the full skill file before executing:
```
read_file("./skills/secure/SKILL.md")
```
Then follow that skill's workflow exactly.

**General pattern:**
```
read_file("./skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md")
```

## Subagents (7 Built-in)

Godmode ships with 7 specialized agents. For complex tasks, use the planner to decompose, then dispatch builders in parallel.

| Agent | Role | Read agents/*.md for full instructions |
|---|---|---|
| **planner** | Decomposes goals → parallel tasks mapped to skills | `read_file("./agents/planner.md")` |
| **builder** | Implements a task following a skill workflow | `read_file("./agents/builder.md")` |
| **reviewer** | Reviews code for correctness + security | `read_file("./agents/reviewer.md")` |
| **optimizer** | Autonomous measure → modify → verify loop | `read_file("./agents/optimizer.md")` |
| **explorer** | Read-only codebase recon | `read_file("./agents/explorer.md")` |
| **security** | STRIDE + OWASP audit | `read_file("./agents/security.md")` |
| **tester** | TDD test generation | `read_file("./agents/tester.md")` |

Note: Gemini CLI does not support parallel subagent dispatch. Execute agent roles sequentially: plan → explore → build → review → optimize.

## Command Definitions

Gemini CLI discovers `/godmode` as a slash command via the `commands/` directory:

- `commands/godmode.md` — top-level `/godmode` command (orchestrator)
- `commands/godmode/<skill>.md` — each sub-command (e.g., `/godmode:optimize`, `/godmode:secure`)

When a user types `/godmode:optimize`, Gemini CLI reads `commands/godmode/optimize.md` for usage info, then loads the full skill from `skills/optimize/SKILL.md` for execution.

## Core Behaviors

1. **Slash commands**: When the user types `/godmode`, read `./commands/godmode.md` for routing, then follow the orchestrator workflow. When they type `/godmode:<name>`, read `./commands/godmode/<name>.md` for usage, then read `./skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and follow it.
2. **Auto-detection**: If the user describes a task without a slash command, match it to the most relevant skill from the catalog, read its SKILL.md, and execute.
3. **Phase loop**: The ideal flow is THINK -> BUILD -> OPTIMIZE -> SHIP. After completing a skill, suggest the next logical step.
4. **Always investigate first**: Run `git status`, check for tests, read project files before recommending actions.
5. **One skill at a time**: Load and follow one skill's full workflow. Do not mix instructions from multiple skills simultaneously.

## How the Loop Works on Gemini

Godmode's core loop is the same on every platform: **measure -> modify -> verify -> keep or revert -> repeat**. On Claude Code, the modify step can dispatch multiple agents in parallel worktrees. On Gemini CLI, the same loop runs with one agent at a time in the current session. The dispatch is sequential, but every other aspect is identical:

- **Same measurement.** The metric command runs before and after each change. Baselines, thresholds, and diminishing-returns detection use the same logic.
- **Same verification.** Guard rails (test_cmd, lint_cmd, build_cmd) run after every modification. A change that fails verification is reverted, exactly as on Claude Code.
- **Same keep/revert decision.** The TSV log records the same columns, the same KEEP/REVERT verdicts, and the same metric deltas. A log produced on Gemini CLI is indistinguishable from one produced on Claude Code.
- **Same output.** The final code changes, commit history, and summary report are identical regardless of whether agents ran in parallel or sequentially.

The only difference is wall-clock time. A 3-agent optimize round that takes 2 minutes on Claude Code takes roughly 6 minutes on Gemini CLI. The result is the same.

## Sequential Execution (Gemini CLI Limitation)

Gemini CLI does not support parallel agent dispatch or native worktrees. When a skill says "dispatch N agents in parallel" or "isolation: worktree":

1. **Parallel agents → sequential**: Execute each agent's task one at a time in the current session. Complete fully (implement, test, commit) before starting the next.
2. **Worktree isolation → branches**: Use `run_shell_command("git checkout -b godmode-{task}")` instead of EnterWorktree. Merge back with `run_shell_command("git checkout main && git merge godmode-{task}")`.
3. **Skills with `## Platform Fallback` sections**: `build`, `optimize`, `review`, and the `godmode` orchestrator include specific sequential execution instructions. Follow those when present.
