# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding assistants when working with this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains reusable AI coding workflows and focused skills that can be installed globally or per-project in any environment (Cursor, Claude Code, Gemini, Codex). Each package is a self-contained directory with structured markdown files that AI agents can read and execute.

**Current simple skills:**
- **gh-stack** — Manages stacked PRs with gh-stack (creation, viewing, editing, push, submit, sync, rebase, merge, checkout)
- **report-bug** — Configurable, evidence-based Jira Bug reporting with explicit confirmation

**Current workflows:**
- **ai-ready** — Codebase scanning and AGENTS.md generation (update)
- **bugfix** — Systematic bug resolution (assess, reproduce, diagnose, fix, test, review, document, pr)
- **code-review** — AI-driven code review with human-in-the-loop decisions (start, continue, clean)
- **cve-fix** — Automated CVE remediation from Jira tickets (start, scan, patch, validate, pr, backport, close | standalone: report)
- **design** — Design-and-decompose workflow (ingest, research, draft, decompose, revise, publish, respond, sync)
- **docs-writer** — Documentation creation workflow (gather, plan, draft, validate, apply, mr)
- **e2e** — Story-to-tests workflow for [QE] stories (ingest, plan, revise, code, validate, publish, respond)
- **implement** — Story-to-code workflow (ingest, plan, revise, code, validate, publish, respond)
- **kcs** — KCS Solution article workflow (gather, draft, validate, handoff)
- **prd** — Requirements-to-PRD workflow (ingest, clarify, draft, revise, publish, respond)
- **rebase-stack** — Rebase a stacked-branch chain with conflict guidance, per-branch validation, and push (start, continue, validate, push)
- **sizing** — Pre-cycle Feature sizing with T-shirt sizes and team effort breakdowns (ingest, assess, apply)
- **skill-reviewer** — Meta-workflow that audits AI skill directories
- **triage** — Bulk Jira bug triage with AI-driven categorization and HTML reports

## Architecture

### Workflow Structure

Every workflow follows this canonical structure:

```text
workflow-name/
  SKILL.md              # Entry point with YAML frontmatter (name, version, description)
  guidelines.md         # Behavioral rules: principles, hard limits, safety, quality
  README.md             # Human-readable documentation (prerequisites, artifacts, usage)
  skills/
    controller.md       # Optional discovery and ambiguous-input router
    dispatch.md         # Optional lightweight explicit-phase dispatcher
    completion.md       # Optional centralized next-step guidance
    phase-name.md       # Implementation for each phase
  commands/
    phase-name.md       # Thin wrappers that invoke a controller, dispatcher, SKILL.md, or phase
  scripts/              # Optional — deterministic operations invoked by skills
  prompts/              # Optional — prompt templates for sub-agent delegation
```

Simple skills live at `skills/{skill-name}/` with a `SKILL.md` entry point and
only the references, scripts, or assets they need.

### Simple Skill Structure

```text
skills/
  skill-name/
    SKILL.md              # Entry point with YAML frontmatter
    references/           # Optional conditional instructions and schemas
    templates/            # Optional generated-content templates
    scripts/              # Optional deterministic implementation helpers
```

Simple skills are focused capabilities, not phase-based workflows. Add only the
resources required by the skill; they do not need a controller, commands,
guidelines, README, or artifact lifecycle by default.

**Key architectural principles:**
1. **Auto-discovery**: The installer discovers top-level `*/SKILL.md` workflows and `skills/*/SKILL.md` simple skills; package names must be globally unique
2. **Progressive disclosure**: SKILL.md is thin (under 30 lines); details live in workflow guidelines/phases or a simple skill's references
3. **Relative paths**: All file references must be relative to the file's location (for symlink compatibility)
4. **Phase-based execution**: Most workflows operate through discrete phases with explicit transitions
5. **Shared resources**: Cross-cutting concerns live in `_shared/` and are referenced by relative path from workflows or simple skills
6. **Phase overrides**: Projects can override individual phases by placing a replacement skill file at `.workflows/{workflow}/skills/{phase}.md` in their repo root. The controller or lightweight dispatcher checks for this override before falling back to the built-in default. See CONTRIBUTING.md for details.

### Shared Resources (`_shared/`)

```text
_shared/
  provenance-schema.md            # Provenance contract for planning docs (footer + session log)
  content-rules.md                # Shared generated-content rules for all workflows
  review-protocol.md              # Shared code review criteria, finding format, severity definitions
  sizing-rubric.md                # Shared sizing definitions (T-shirt sizes, heuristics, team effort guidance)
  scripts/
    provenance.py                 # Capture/render CLI (used by prd and design provenance recipes)
    pr-comments.py                # Deterministic PR comment operations (fetch, reply, log)
    publish.py                    # Deterministic publish operations (push, PR/MR, metadata)
    resolve-phase.py              # Deterministic phase override resolution (file-existence check)
    fetch-issue.py                # Deterministic Jira issue fetching (get, search)
  recipes/
    capture-provenance-event.md   # Append session-local provenance on doc-mutating phases
    phase-override-resolution.md  # Project-level phase override lookup and activation
    record-manual-edit.md         # Tier 3 manual-edit attribution (wraps capture recipe)
    render-provenance-footer.md   # Render durable footer into docs-repo markdown before commit
    self-review-gate.md           # Pre-PR self-review quality gate (used by bugfix, implement, e2e, cve-fix)
    validation-gate.md            # Pre-commit build/test/lint discovery gate (used by bugfix)
```

Recipes are self-contained, parameterized procedures that packages reference via relative path (e.g., `../../_shared/recipes/self-review-gate.md` from a workflow phase). Workflows and simple skills may also reference shared files from guidelines, phases, references, templates, prompts, scripts, and other behavioral files — all such references count as consumers for the shared-file cascade (see Package Versioning). The **prd** and **design** workflows use the provenance recipes on `/draft`, `/revise`, `/respond` (capture) and `/publish` plus docs-sync paths (render). See `_shared/provenance-schema.md` for the published footer format.

### File Reference Conventions

Critical for symlink resolution:
- `commands/*.md` reference `../skills/controller.md`, `../skills/dispatch.md`, `../SKILL.md`, or `../skills/phase-name.md`; dispatchers identify the target with an explicit phase parameter
- `skills/controller.md`, `skills/dispatch.md`, and `skills/completion.md` reference sibling skills as `phase-name.md` (not `skills/phase-name.md`)
- `SKILL.md` references `guidelines.md` and optionally `skills/controller.md` (same directory)
- `skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` references its resources relative to the simple skill directory (for example, `references/rendering.md`)

## Key Constraints

1. **No IDE-specific syntax**: All workflow and simple-skill content is plain markdown
2. **Relative paths only**: For symlink compatibility across install scopes
3. **Progressive disclosure**: SKILL.md stays under 30 lines
4. **No auto-advance in attended mode**: Workflows wait for user input between phases unless an explicit unattended mode is documented for that workflow
5. **Artifact persistence**: Significant workflow outputs are saved to `.artifacts/{workflow-name}/{context}/`; simple skills persist artifacts only when their contract explicitly requires it
6. **Read-only reviews**: skill-reviewer never modifies target skill files during review
7. **Artifact isolation**: `.artifacts/{workflow-name}/` is each workflow's private state. Other workflows must never read from or write to another workflow's artifact directory. The shared interfaces between workflows are: Jira (canonical source for issue data), published docs repo files (PRDs, designs, testplans), and workspace-level config at `.artifacts/config.json`

## Package Versioning

When modifying a committed workflow or simple skill, update the version in that
package's `SKILL.md` frontmatter following semver. A new, uncommitted package may
remain at its initial `0.1.0` while it is being developed:

- **PATCH** (0.1.0 → 0.1.1): Typo fixes, wording clarification
  without behavioral change, formatting
- **MINOR** (0.1.0 → 0.2.0): Adding/changing/reordering behavior,
  modifying rules, changing templates, or adding workflow phases
- **MAJOR** (0.1.0 → 1.0.0): Removing or renaming public phases,
  commands, configuration keys, or other package interfaces; incompatible restructuring

### Version bump baseline

Version bumps are computed **relative to the merge base with `main`**, not
relative to the current branch state. Each PR warrants **at most one version
increment per package** at any given semver level.

Rules:

1. Before bumping, compare the version in your branch against the version at
   `git merge-base HEAD main` (the CI script does this automatically).
2. If you already bumped a package's version for this PR, do **not** bump it
   again for additional changes at the same semver level.
3. The only reason to re-bump within a PR is when the **class** of change
   escalates (PATCH → MINOR or MINOR → MAJOR). In that case, set the version
   to what the higher level requires relative to the merge base — do not stack
   increments.

**Example — wrong (cumulative over-bumping):**

```text
merge-base version: 0.2.0
commit 1: fix typo          → bump to 0.2.1 (PATCH) ✓
commit 2: fix another typo  → bump to 0.2.2 (PATCH) ✗ already bumped
commit 3: add a new step    → bump to 0.3.0 (MINOR) ✗ stacked on 0.2.2
```

**Example — correct (single bump relative to merge base):**

```text
merge-base version: 0.2.0
commit 1: fix typo          → bump to 0.2.1 (PATCH) ✓
commit 2: fix another typo  → keep 0.2.1 (already bumped PATCH) ✓
commit 3: add a new step    → change to 0.3.0 (escalate PATCH → MINOR) ✓
```

### Which files require a version bump

Behavioral files (the AI reads and executes these):
`SKILL.md` body, `guidelines.md`, `skills/*.md`, `commands/*.md`,
`templates/*`, `prompts/*`, `scripts/*`, `_shared/**/*.md`, and
root-level `.md` files in workflow directories that are read during
execution (e.g., `design/decomposition-review.md`). For simple skills, this
includes `skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`, `references/*`, `templates/*`,
`prompts/*`, `scripts/*`, and other files read or executed by the skill.

Non-behavioral files (no bump needed): `README.md`, `GUIDE.md`

### Shared file cascade

When you modify a file in `_shared/`, also PATCH-bump every workflow or simple skill
that references it — including references in templates, prompts, scripts,
and other behavioral markdown listed under "Which files require a version
bump". Find affected workflows by searching for the basename (e.g.,
`self-review-gate` for `_shared/recipes/self-review-gate.md`, or
`content-rules` for `_shared/content-rules.md`):

```bash
grep -rl "<basename-without-extension>" \
  */SKILL.md \
  */guidelines.md \
  */skills/*.md \
  */commands/*.md \
  */templates/*.md \
  */prompts/*.md \
  */scripts/* \
  2>/dev/null | sed 's|/.*||' | sort -u

grep -rl "<basename-without-extension>" \
  skills/*/SKILL.md \
  skills/*/references/*.md \
  skills/*/templates/* \
  skills/*/prompts/*.md \
  skills/*/scripts/* \
  2>/dev/null | sed -E 's|^(skills/[^/]+)/.*|\1|' | sort -u
```

Also check simple-skill references/templates/scripts and root-level workflow
`.md` files read during execution (e.g., `design/decomposition-review.md`). The CI script
`.github/scripts/validate-versions.sh` applies this full set of patterns.

Bump each discovered consuming package's `SKILL.md` version (PATCH increment).

### Commit convention

Include the version bump in the same commit as the behavioral change.
Do not make a separate commit for the version bump.

## Installation

Install with `./install.sh <target>` (targets: `cursor`, `claude`, `gemini`,
`codex`, `all`). See README.md for scopes, options, and uninstall instructions.

## Development

## Path to Production

When a workflow or simple skill invokes commands that could affect shared systems:
- **Git operations**: Always verify with `git status` before destructive operations
- **PR/MR creation**: Confirm branch and base before pushing
- **Jira writes**: cve-fix `/close`, design `/sync`, sizing `/apply`, and `report-bug` may write to Jira; all require explicit approval. `report-bug` may create only the fully previewed issue and approved follow-up links/attachments
- **Documentation changes**: Run Vale validation before applying changes to repository files
