description: Refactors CLAUDE.md into minimal startup context by extracting path-specific rules, skills, commands, and agents. Use when CLAUDE.md exceeds 50 lines, startup feels slow, memory needs restructuring, or splitting monolithic project instructions. Use when this capability is needed.

# Memory Optimizer

Restructures `.claude/CLAUDE.md` using progressive disclosure to minimize startup tokens.

## Decision Table

| Signal in CLAUDE.md                                        | Extract To                       | Frontmatter                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| File extensions (`.ts`, `.py`) or directories (`src/api/`) | `.claude/rules/{topic}.md`       | `paths: {glob}`                   |
| Multi-step workflow (3+ steps)                             | `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` | `name:`, `description:`           |
| User-triggered template                                    | `.claude/commands/{name}.md`     | `description:`                    |
| Specialized task needing limited tools                     | `.claude/agents/{name}.md`       | `name:`, `description:`, `tools:` |
| Essential for ALL interactions                             | Keep in CLAUDE.md                | —                                 |

## Workflow

1. **Analyze**: Read CLAUDE.md, count lines
2. **Categorize**: Apply decision table to each section
3. **Plan**: Present extraction table for approval
4. **Extract**: Create files with proper frontmatter
5. **Refactor**: Reduce CLAUDE.md to <50 lines
6. **Report**: Show before/after line counts

## Extraction Plan Format

Present before creating files:

```markdown
| Content        | Extract To                     | Type    | Trigger/Path        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------- | ------------------- |
| TS conventions | .claude/rules/typescript.md    | Rule    | `**/*.ts`           |
| Deploy process | .claude/skills/deploy/SKILL.md | Skill   | "deploy", "release" |
| PR template    | .claude/commands/review.md     | Command | `/review`           |
| Security check | .claude/agents/security.md     | Agent   | security tasks      |
```

## File Templates

### Rule

```yaml
---
paths: src/**/*.ts
---
# {Topic}
{ Instructions }
```

### Skill

```yaml
---
name: {kebab-case}
description: {What it does}. Use when {triggers}.
---
# {Name}
{Instructions}
```

### Command

```yaml
---
description: { Brief description }
---
{ Prompt template with $ARGUMENTS }
```

### Agent

```yaml
---
name: {name}
description: {When to delegate}. Use proactively for {triggers}.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---
# {Name}
{Instructions}
```

## Refactored CLAUDE.md Target

```markdown
# {Project}

{1-2 sentence overview}

## Commands

- Build: `{cmd}`
- Test: `{cmd}`

## References

- @README.md
- @docs/architecture.md
```

**Goal: <50 lines, ideally 20-30**

## Validation

After extraction, verify:

- CLAUDE.md line count reduced
- Each file has valid YAML frontmatter
- Rules have `paths:`, skills have `description:` with "Use when"

## Description Formula

`{Verb} {what}. Use when {trigger1}, {trigger2}, or {trigger3}.`

Bad: `Helps with code review`
Good: `Reviews code for security and performance issues. Use when reviewing PRs, checking code quality, or after major changes.`
