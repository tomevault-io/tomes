# BetterHttpClient - outbound HTTP in an application (DI, options, requests, test interop)

`SnowBank.Networking.Http` replaces ad-hoc `HttpClient` / legacy `HttpWebRequest` usage with a small set of load-bearing pieces. This skill is the consumer guide: wiring the DI, declaring named clients, making requests, and what you get for free inside the distributed test framework. For diagnosing multi-node tests themselves (journal, packet capture output, log knobs) see the **snowbank-distributed-testing** skill.

> **7.4.4 changed the model.** A client name now maps to one effective policy that lives in the pooled handler chain, so every client behaves the same, including a plain injected `HttpClient`. The old `IBetterHttpClientFactory` shell, `BetterHttpShellOptions`, `IBetterHttpFilter`, and the global-filter helpers still work but are `[Obsolete]` warnings now. Section 10 maps each retired member to its replacement.

## 1. The mental model: one policy per name, on the chain

Three layers, each with its own lifetime:

| Piece | What it is | Lifetime | Who owns it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Named policy** | A NAME registered with `AddBetterHttpClient(name, configure)`: TLS policy, credentials, default headers, hooks, delegating handlers. A name is **wire policy, not an origin**: the call site provides the absolute target URI at request time. | registration | you (startup code) |
| **Pooled handler chain** | The actual `HttpMessageHandler` stack built per name: transport at the bottom, the pipeline handler and any application handlers on top. Owns the sockets. | pooled, managed by `Microsoft.Extensions.Http` | the platform |
| **`HttpClient`** | A plain client the factory hands you: a typed client, a keyed client, or one from `IHttpClientFactory.CreateClient(name)`. Cheap to create, and disposing it never tears down the shared sockets. | transient, per use | you |

The chain, bottom to top:

```
   [HttpClient, however obtained]       <- typed, keyed, or IHttpClientFactory.CreateClient(name)
        |
   (packet capture, when present)       <- outermost, inserted automatically in tests
   application handlers                  <- AddHttpMessageHandler, in registration order
   BetterHttpPipelineHandler             <- runs the name's request stage per request
   transport wrappers                    <- credentials' transport half, custom delegating handlers
   INetworkMap.CreateTransportHandler    <- SocketsHttpHandler in production,
                                            the virtual network inside a DistributedTest
```

`BetterHttpPipelineHandler` (the piece that replaced `MagicalHandler`) is the difference from 7.4.3. It self-contexts: on a plain `client.GetAsync(...)` it builds the `BetterHttpClientContext` itself and runs the name's request stage (credentials, hooks, default headers), so **the full policy runs for every client, not only on the old shell's `SendAsync`**. A request that already carries a context (from the `SendAsync(request, ctx => ...)` extension) is enriched and runs the same lifecycle.

Two properties fall out of this design:

- **Late binding**: the target host is resolved per request against the live `INetworkMap`, not captured when the handler is built. A long-lived client keeps working across topology changes (a restarted backend, a re-pointed VIP).
- **No default chain rotation**: names are registered with an infinite handler lifetime, because the transport already bounds DNS staleness itself (`PooledConnectionLifetime` on the shared `SocketsHttpHandler`). A name that wants periodic chain rebuild opts back in AFTER registration: `services.AddHttpClient(name).SetHandlerLifetime(...)`.

**Why the URI belongs at the call site, not in the registration.** Not just convenience: `HttpClient.BaseAddress` is immutable after the first request, so an address baked in at registration time *cannot* follow a configuration change an admin makes at run time. The pooled transport, by contrast, is origin-agnostic (`SocketsHttpHandler` pools per-origin internally), so a call site passing an absolute URI re-targets for free: the same client starts hitting the new origin's pool and the old connections idle out. Build the absolute URI from live configuration at the moment of the call.

## 2. Startup wiring

The public startup API is three methods; the transport seam is mandatory.

```csharp
// 1. the transport seam: mandatory. Without it, the first client resolution throws
//    "You must register an implementation for INetworkMap ...".
//    TryAdd, not Add: in production nothing else registers the map (TryAdd == Add), and if this
//    composition ever runs inside a distributed-test host, the framework has ALREADY registered the
//    virtual network map - TryAdd yields to it, a plain Add would clobber the simulation.
services.TryAddSingleton<INetworkMap, NetworkMap>();   // namespace SnowBank.Networking

// 2. the defaults hook: routes EVERY factory client through the map, so a plain AddHttpClient
//    needs no enrollment. The configure sets the baseline for every client.
services.AddBetterHttpClientDefaults(options =>
{
    options.DefaultRequestHeaders.UserAgent = [ new ProductInfoHeaderValue("AcmeApp", "5.2") ];
});

// 3. any named clients that need their own policy (certificates, credentials, handlers)
services.AddBetterHttpClient("Catalog", options =>
{
    options.AcceptSelfSignedServerCertificates();
});
```

Notes:

- `AddBetterHttpClientDefaults(configure)` is **the one mandatory call**. It installs a `ConfigureHttpClientDefaults` hook that routes every factory client (named, typed via `AddHttpClient<TClient>`, keyed, or a plain `AddHttpClient("x")`) through the map, so a stock client needs no enrollment and a distributed-test host sandboxes every factory client by construction. The global `configure` sets the baseline (transport, default headers, TLS trust, credentials) for every client.
- `AddBetterHttpClient("name", configure)` adds a named client whose per-name options override that baseline. A client with **no** BetterHttp-specific policy does not need it: a plain `services.AddHttpClient("weather", c => c.Timeout = ...)` is already fully enrolled by the defaults hook.
- Both are safe to call more than once: each `configure` composes (in order), and the defaults hook installs once.
- Registering the same name twice composes: both configure callbacks run, so several call sites can contribute policies to one name.
- The name `"SnowBank.Networking.Http.BetterHttpClient"` (`BetterHttpClientExtensions.DefaultClientName`) is reserved for the default client.
- Inside a distributed test you do NOT wire `INetworkMap`: the framework registers the virtual network map in every simulated host (see section 8).

**`AddBetterHttpClient(name, ...)` returns an `IBetterHttpClientBuilder`.** It derives from the native `IHttpClientBuilder`, so the standard registration extensions chain on, and BetterHttp-specific extensions target it:

```csharp
services.AddBetterHttpClient("Catalog", options => options.AcceptSelfSignedServerCertificates())
    .AddHttpMessageHandler<RetryHandler>()   // an application DelegatingHandler
    .AddAsKeyed();                            // keyed injection, Microsoft.Extensions.Http 9.0+
```

The old no-name `AddBetterHttpClient(configure)` overload stays retired (`[Obsolete(error: true)]`): it wired only the default client, so a stock `AddHttpClient` escaped the map. Call `AddBetterHttpClientDefaults(configure)`.

## 3. Getting a client: every kind is equivalent

Every kind of client gives the same policy, because the policy lives in the chain. Pick by consumer lifetime:

| Consumer | Client kind | API |
|---|---|---|
| Request-scoped (controllers, per-request services) | typed or keyed client | `AddHttpClient<CatalogService>()` (ctor-injected `HttpClient`), or `.AddAsKeyed()` then `[FromKeyedServices("Catalog")] HttpClient` |
| Singletons, static-cached factories | `IHttpClientFactory` | `factory.CreateClient("Catalog")`, `using var` per operation |
| Third-party libs that build their own client (gRPC, SignalR, Kiota) | `IHttpMessageHandlerFactory` | `factory.CreateHandler("Catalog")` returns the bare pooled chain |

All four carry the name's full policy, including packet capture inside tests. A plain `HttpClient` is enough: a service can depend on `HttpClient` (typed client) and receive a fully configured instance.

```csharp
// a singleton that talks to Catalog:
public sealed class CatalogGateway
{
    public CatalogGateway(IHttpClientFactory clients) => this.Clients = clients;
    private IHttpClientFactory Clients { get; }

    public async Task<CatalogDto> FetchAsync(Uri origin, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        using var client = this.Clients.CreateClient("Catalog");
        var request = client.CreateGetRequest(new Uri(origin, "/api/catalog"));
        return await client.SendAsync(request, async ctx =>
        {
            ctx.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
            return await ctx.ReadAsJsonAsync<CatalogDto>();
        }, ct);
    }
}
```

Holding one client long-lived is correct (late binding keeps routing it against the live network), but the per-operation `CreateClient` idiom stays the convention for long-lived services: creation is cheap and `Dispose` never closes sockets.

> **Legacy:** `IBetterHttpClientFactory.CreateClient(...)` and the `BetterHttpClient` shell still resolve, now under `[Obsolete]` warnings. They are no longer the primary way to get a client. Section 10 lists the moves.

## 4. Making requests

Add `using SnowBank.Networking.Http;` - the request API lives in extension methods on `HttpClient`, so it works on any client:

- Request builders: `client.CreateGetRequest(path)`, `CreatePostRequest(path, content)`, `CreatePutRequest`, `CreatePatchRequest`, `CreateDeleteRequest`, `CreateHeadRequest`, `CreateOptionsRequest`, `CreateTraceRequest` (each with `string` or `Uri` overloads, resolved against `BaseAddress`).
- The send lifecycle: `client.SendAsync(request, handler, ct)` where the handler receives a **`BetterHttpClientContext`** while the response is still open:

```csharp
var result = await client.SendAsync(
    client.CreateGetRequest("/api/catalog"),
    async (ctx) =>
    {
        ctx.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        return await ctx.ReadAsJsonAsync<CatalogDto>();   // CrystalJson deserialization
    },
    ct);
```

`BetterHttpClientContext` carries `Request`, `Response`, the DI `Services`, the injected `Clock`, a per-request `State` bag (how stages coordinate), and helpers: `EnsureSuccessStatusCode()`, `ReadAsJsonAsync()` / `ReadAsJsonObjectAsync()` / `ReadAsJsonArrayAsync()` / `ReadAsJsonAsync<TResult>()`.

Cancellation tokens are required across this stack, never optional: pass the caller's real token (`HttpContext.RequestAborted`, a `BackgroundService`'s `stoppingToken`, ...).

> **What a plain `GetAsync` gets.** Since 7.4.4 the in-chain `BetterHttpPipelineHandler` runs the name's request stage (credentials, hooks, default headers) even for a bare `client.GetAsync(...)`. So a signing credential on the name signs a plain `GetAsync` too. The `SendAsync(request, ctx => ...)` form adds the context callback, the `State` bag, and the JSON helpers, and lets you read the response while the stack still owns disposal, which is why the callback processes the response rather than returning it.

## 5. Options and scopes

| Scope | Type | Where | What belongs there |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Per name** (wire policy) | `BetterHttpClientOptions` | `AddBetterHttpClient(name, options => ...)` at startup | TLS/certificates, proxy, cookies, credentials, hooks, delegating handlers, default headers |
| **Configuration override** | the `BetterHttp` section | `AddBetterHttpClientConfiguration(configuration)` | the ops-safe subset (section 6), applied after code, last word |
| **Per call** (typed protocols) | the protocol's options | `protocolFactory.CreateClient(uri, o => ...)` | protocol/client behavior only |

The rule: **wire policy lives on the name, at startup**. A per-call configure that touches wire policy (a TLS callback, a delegating handler) cannot reach the shared pooled transport, and silently ignoring it would be a silent security break, so it **throws**, naming the offending member. The per-call side may set client behavior only: default headers, request options, hooks, `Timeout`, and per-request-only credentials (a message signer stamping a different identity per client); all of them run per request, in the chain.

Useful `BetterHttpClientOptions` members:

- `DefaultRequestHeaders` (a `BetterDefaultHeaders`; includes `UserAgent`), `Cookies`, `Credentials`, `DefaultProxyCredentials`.
- `Hooks` (`IBetterHttpHooks`), `Handlers` and `WithDelegatingHandler<THandler>()` for classic `DelegatingHandler`s. For per-request stages, prefer a standard `DelegatingHandler` added with `.AddHttpMessageHandler<T>()` on the builder.
- TLS: `ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback` (connection-shaped: `(cert, chain, errors) => bool`, no request argument, it validates a connection and maps directly onto the socket transport's `SslOptions`), `ClientCertificates`, `ClientCertificateOptions`, `CheckCertificateRevocationList`.
- TLS helpers, in decreasing order of preference:
  - `TrustServerCertificates(params X509Certificate2[] roots)` - pin known roots;
  - `AcceptSelfSignedServerCertificates()` - accept an otherwise-valid self-signed leaf (typical for appliances);
  - `DangerousAcceptAnyServerCertificate()` - accept everything; test/lab only, the name is the warning, and it is `[Obsolete]` so the call site must acknowledge it with a `#pragma`.

> **Retired scope:** the per-shell overlay (`BetterHttpShellOptions`, passed to the old `factory.CreateClient(baseAddress, shell, name)`) is gone. Put policy on the name, or set it on the request itself.

## 6. Binding options from configuration

`AddBetterHttpClientConfiguration(configuration, sectionName = "BetterHttp")` registers a configuration override layer. The section is a **pure override**: when it is absent, the code-configured behavior runs unchanged.

```csharp
services.AddBetterHttpClientConfiguration(builder.Configuration);   // reads the "BetterHttp" section
```

```json
"BetterHttp": {
  "Defaults": {
    "AutomaticDecompression": "All"
  },
  "Clients": {
    "Catalog": {
      "Timeout": "00:00:30",
      "Tls": { "Mode": "AcceptSelfSigned" }
    }
  }
}
```

- `Defaults` overrides the global baseline for every client; `Clients:<name>` overrides one named client. Both apply after the code layers, so configuration has the last word.
- Only the operation-safe subset binds: `Timeout`, `AllowAutoRedirect`, `AutomaticDecompression`, and `Tls:Mode` (`System`, `AcceptSelfSigned`, `AcceptAny`). Credentials, hooks, handlers, and TLS callbacks are code-only by construction, they cannot be reached from a string.
- A knob can carry `"inherit"` to cancel every override below the global layers, so the effective value falls back to the code-global baseline (for a knob in `Clients:<name>`, this also cancels that client's own code configure).
- Repeated calls compose, applied in registration order.

## 7. Porting legacy HttpWebRequest code (the AddFooClient recipe)

Where legacy .NET Framework members go:

| Legacy (`HttpWebRequest` / `ServicePointManager`) | Now |
|---|---|
| `WebRequest.Create(url)` per call | one injected client; absolute URI per request |
| `req.UserAgent = "AcmeApp/5.2"` | `options.DefaultRequestHeaders.UserAgent` on the name |
| `req.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = ... => true` | `AcceptSelfSignedServerCertificates()` (or `TrustServerCertificates`; reserve `DangerousAcceptAnyServerCertificate` for tests) |
| `req.Headers.Add("Authorization", ...)` | per request (`request.Headers.Authorization = ...`), or a credential on the name |
| `req.GetResponse()` + `StreamReader` (sync) | `await client.SendAsync(request, ctx => ..., ct)` |
| `req.Proxy`, `req.Credentials`, `req.CookieContainer` | `DefaultProxyCredentials` / `Credentials` / `Cookies` on the name |
| `ServicePointManager` global state | per-name options (there is no process-global mutable state) |

Before (net472):

```csharp
public class CatalogGateway
{
    public string FetchCatalog(string server, string token)
    {
        var req = (HttpWebRequest) WebRequest.Create($"https://{server}/api/catalog");
        req.UserAgent = "AcmeApp/5.2";
        req.Headers.Add("Authorization", "Bearer " + token);
        req.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = (s, cert, chain, errors) => true;
        using var resp = (HttpWebResponse) req.GetResponse();
        using var reader = new StreamReader(resp.GetResponseStream());
        return reader.ReadToEnd();
    }
}
```

After (net8+/net10), a typed client plus its registration extension:

```csharp
public sealed class CatalogGateway
{
    public CatalogGateway(HttpClient client) => this.Client = client;

    private HttpClient Client { get; }

    public async Task<string> FetchCatalogAsync(Uri server, string token, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var request = this.Client.CreateGetRequest(new Uri(server, "/api/catalog"));
        request.Headers.Authorization = new("Bearer", token);
        return await this.Client.SendAsync(request, async (ctx) =>
        {
            ctx.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
            return await ctx.Response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(ct);
        }, ct);
    }
}

public static class CatalogClientExtensions
{
    /// <summary>Registers the Catalog gateway and its HTTP policy.</summary>
    public static IServiceCollection AddCatalogClient(this IServiceCollection services, Action<BetterHttpClientOptions>? configure = null)
    {
        services.AddBetterHttpClient("Catalog", options =>
        {
            options.DefaultRequestHeaders.UserAgent = [ new ProductInfoHeaderValue("AcmeApp", "5.2") ];
            options.AcceptSelfSignedServerCertificates();   // self-signed appliances
            configure?.Invoke(options);                      // let the host override defaults
        });
        services.AddHttpClient<CatalogGateway>("Catalog");   // typed client on the named policy
        return services;
    }
}
```

The host wires `AddCatalogClient()` once; the gateway takes a plain `HttpClient` and never touches certificates. The `AddHttpClient<CatalogGateway>("Catalog")` typed-client registration binds the gateway to the "Catalog" policy.

## 8. Typed protocols (`IBetterHttpProtocol`)

For a structured API surface (instead of raw requests), wrap the client in a protocol:

- **`RestHttpProtocol`** ships in this repo: `services.AddRestHttpProtocol(options => ...)`, then inject `RestHttpProtocolFactory` and `factory.CreateClient(baseAddress, o => ...)` for a JSON/REST convenience client.
- Consuming SDKs layer their own (e.g. a JSON-API protocol in an application-level SDK).
- To build one: implement `IBetterHttpProtocol` + a factory deriving `BetterHttpProtocolFactoryBase<TProtocol, TOptions>` (with `TOptions : BetterHttpClientOptions`), and expose it as a dedicated `AddFooProtocol()` extension that calls `services.AddBetterHttpProtocol<TFactory, TProtocol, TOptions>(configure)`.

Remember the scope rule from section 5: the per-call `configure` on `factory.CreateClient(uri, o => ...)` is for protocol/client behavior (headers, request options, hooks, `Timeout`, per-request-only credentials); wire policy there throws.

## 9. Inside the distributed test framework: zero-change interop

When application code runs on a simulated host of a `DistributedTest` (see the **snowbank-distributed-testing** skill), the SAME registrations acquire test behavior automatically - do not add any test-specific wiring to application code:

- **The virtual network replaces the transport.** The framework registers the virtual network map as the host's `INetworkMap`, so every name's chain bottoms out in the simulated network. In-test web hosts are reachable by their simulated names; TestServer-style in-memory handlers, simulated latency and faults all live below the same seam.
- **Packet capture is on every chain.** The capture handler is inserted as the outermost handler of every pooled chain (bare handlers included, so gRPC and SignalR traffic shows up like any other request): every test journal carries one `H` line per request, with bodies dumped on failure. No registration needed. Only the deliberately-raw transport (`INetworkMap.CreateTransportHandler`) stays uncaptured. A **long-lived streaming response** (`application/grpc*` or `text/event-stream`) is captured at **headers only** (metadata plus a `Streaming` flag; the body is never mirrored, so the stream is never torn); finite bodies capture exactly.
- **Request-stage policy runs in tests too.** Because the pipeline handler is in-chain, credentials (signing), hooks, and default headers now run identically inside a distributed test for a plainly-injected client, not only for the old shell.
- **Failures keep their historical shapes.** An unresolvable name surfaces as `HttpRequestException` wrapping a `WebException` with `WebExceptionStatus.NameResolutionFailure`; a stopped host fails like a connect failure. Ported legacy code that matches on these shapes keeps working.
- **Late binding is observable.** Stopping, restarting or re-aliasing a host reroutes the SAME live client on its next request - tests can exercise reconnect logic without recreating clients.

The one thing to avoid in application code: constructing `new HttpClient(new SocketsHttpHandler())` (or `new HttpClient()`) directly. That bypasses `INetworkMap`, so in a distributed test it tries to hit the real network and defeats the simulation (and in production it forfeits the name's policy and the capture seam).

## 10. Migrating off the 7.4.3 surface

These members still work in 7.4.4 under `[Obsolete]` warnings. Move to the replacement when you touch the call site.

| Soft-obsolete (7.4.4) | Replacement |
|---|---|
| `IBetterHttpClientFactory`, `DefaultBetterHttpClientFactory` | inject `IHttpClientFactory` (or a typed/keyed client) and use the `SendAsync` extensions on the `HttpClient` |
| `BetterHttpClient` (the shell type) | any `HttpClient`; the `SendAsync` extensions work on all of them |
| `BetterHttpShellOptions` (per-shell overlay) | per-name options on `AddBetterHttpClient`; for a per-call client tier (headers, hooks, timeout, per-request-only credentials), `services.CreateBetterHttpClient(uri, configure, name)` |
| `IBetterHttpFilter`, `BetterHttpClientOptions.Filters` | a standard `DelegatingHandler` via `.AddHttpMessageHandler<T>()`, or `IBetterHttpHooks` for pure observation |
| `AddGlobalHttpFilter<T>()` | `ConfigureHttpClientDefaults(b => b.AddHttpMessageHandler<T>())` |
| `AddGlobalHttpHandler(factory)` | `ConfigureHttpClientDefaults(b => b.AddHttpMessageHandler(...))` |

Kept and unchanged: `BetterHttpClientOptions` and its TLS helpers, `IBetterCredentials`, `IBetterHttpHooks`, `BetterHttpClientContext`, the `Create*Request` builders and the `SendAsync` extensions, `INetworkMap` / `NetworkMap`, the capture seam, and the typed protocols (`RestHttpProtocol`, `BetterHttpProtocolFactoryBase`), rebuilt internally but with their public `CreateClient(uri, configure)` surface intact.

## 11. Common mistakes

| Mistake | What happens / the fix |
|---|---|
| No `INetworkMap` registered | first resolution throws "You must register an implementation for INetworkMap"; add `services.TryAddSingleton<INetworkMap, NetworkMap>()` in the host composition root |
| Plain `AddSingleton<INetworkMap, NetworkMap>()` in wiring reused by tests | overrides the test framework's virtual map (user registrations run after the framework's base wiring and win), so the "simulated" host silently talks to the real network; use `TryAddSingleton` |
| Treating a name as an origin | names carry policy, not addresses: pass the target `Uri` at `CreateClient`/request time |
| TLS callback or handler in a per-call protocol configure | throws by design; move it to the name registration |
| Caching `HttpClient` instances "because sockets" | unnecessary: clients are cheap and disposing them never closes the pooled sockets; create per use |
| `new HttpClient(...)` in application code | bypasses the map, the name's policy, and packet capture; breaks under the test framework |
| Expecting chain rotation | names default to an infinite handler lifetime (the transport bounds DNS staleness); opt in with `services.AddHttpClient(name).SetHandlerLifetime(...)` AFTER the name registration |
| Fixture/DI hangs on `Task.Result` of a send | the whole stack is async with required tokens; port sync `GetResponse()` call sites to async all the way |
| Reaching for `IBetterHttpFilter` or `AddGlobalHttpFilter` | soft-obsolete; use a `DelegatingHandler` with `.AddHttpMessageHandler<T>()` or `ConfigureHttpClientDefaults` (section 10) |
