# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for AI agents (and humans) working **in this repository**. If you are instead trying to *use* this library in your own application, read the skills under [`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills/), they are written for consumers and are the canonical guide to the key/value and transaction APIs.

## What this repository is

A C#/.NET binding for [FoundationDB](https://www.foundationdb.org/) (a distributed, ordered key/value store), plus the general-purpose libraries it is built on. The main solution is **`FoundationDB.Client.slnx`** (the new XML `.slnx` format). Current version: see [`Common/VersionInfo.props`](Common/VersionInfo.props) (`7.4.x`).

The repo holds **two distinct product families**:

- **`SnowBank.*`**, general-purpose foundation, *not* FoundationDB-specific. `SnowBank.Core` is the bedrock (Slices, the Tuple encoding, the CrystalJson stack, collections, async LINQ, UUIDs). Also `SnowBank.Shell`, `SnowBank.Serialization.Json.CodeGen` (a Roslyn source generator), `SnowBank.Networking.*`, `SnowBank.Testing.*`.
- **`FoundationDB.*`**, the actual binding. `FoundationDB.Client` is the core (native interop, transactions, keys/values, subspaces, the Directory layer, tenants, DI). `FoundationDB.Layers.Common` holds demo layers (Map, Index, Vector, Queue, Counter, Blob, …). Aspire, FakeDb, Testing, BindingTester, and the `Fdb*` tools sit around it.

### Dependency direction (do not invert)

```
SnowBank.Core  ◄─  FoundationDB.Client  ◄─  FoundationDB.Layers.Common  ◄─  Layers.Experimental, Linq.Providers
     ▲                                                                  
SnowBank.Shell, SnowBank.Networking.*, SnowBank.Testing.*, SnowBank.Serialization.Json.CodeGen
```

`SnowBank.Core` has **no** project references and must never depend on FoundationDB. `FoundationDB.Client` depends only on `SnowBank.Core`. Tooling/tests reference downward only.

## Build & test

```bash
dotnet build FoundationDB.Client.slnx                  # DEBUG build of everything
dotnet test <Project>.csproj -f net11.0                # ONE suite; always scope the TFM, see "Tests"
```

- **SDK**: pinned in [`global.json`](global.json) to a **.NET 11 preview** SDK (`rollForward: latestMinor`). `LangVersion` is `preview`.
- **Target frameworks**: libraries multi-target `net11.0;net10.0;net8.0` (see [`Directory.Build.props`](Directory.Build.props)). Each project builds once per target. Several projects **also build a `netstandard2.0` "lite" variant**, see [The netstandard2.0 / net472 "lite" targets](#the-netstandard20--net472-lite-targets) below; keeping it green is part of any change to those projects.
- **Build output** goes to `artifacts/` (`ArtifactsPath`), not per-project `bin/obj`.
- **Central package management**: all versions live in [`Directory.Packages.props`](Directory.Packages.props). Add/bump packages there, not in `.csproj` files. **Version policy**: this SDK is a BOM for downstream applications, each pin should be the **latest version that still supports its TFM bucket** (the .NET platform wave is multi-TFM, so net8/net9/net10 usually share one version; ASP.NET Core packages are single-TFM and stay capped per bucket). Deliberate exception: `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.*` stays low, because it sets the minimum Roslyn/SDK for consumers of the `SnowBank.Serialization.Json.CodeGen` source generator.
- **As a submodule**: a parent repo can override targets via `CoreSdkVersions` (or the finer `CoreSdkRuntimeVersions` / `CoreSdkToolsVersions` / `CloudSdkRuntimeVersions`), and disable the lite targets via `CoreSdkNetStandardEnabled=false`, in its own `Directory.Build.props`. The override import is gated on a `.git` *file* check; bypass with `FDB_BUILD_PROPS_OVERRIDE=1`.
- **Standalone (isolated) build**: to build, test, or pack THIS repo with its own COMPLETE target set (net8/net10/net11 + netstandard2.0 + the net472 validation targets) while it sits under a target-trimming parent, force `CORESDK_STANDALONE_BUILD=true`, which makes `Directory.Build.props` ignore the parent import. **Pass it as an MSBuild `-p:` property, NEVER as an `$env:`/`export`**: a persistent env var leaks into the shell and silently forces every later `dotnet` command into a standalone build (this bit us once; the pack/build scripts were fixed to pass `-p:`). Use [`scripts/build.ps1`](scripts/build.ps1) / [`scripts/build.sh`](scripts/build.sh) for an isolated `restore`+`clean`+`build`, and [`scripts/pack.ps1`](scripts/pack.ps1) / [`scripts/pack.sh`](scripts/pack.sh) for packaging (packing MUST be standalone, or the `.nupkg` ships an incomplete target set).
- **Shared-restore gotcha**: `restore` writes `artifacts/obj/**/project.assets.json` for whatever mode it ran in, and that state is shared. `restore`, `build`, and `clean` MUST use the SAME mode; mixing them fails with `NETSDK1005` ("assets file doesn't have a target for &lt;TFM&gt;"). After a standalone build, the parent must re-run `dotnet restore` to reset the submodule's assets to its trimmed set (and vice-versa); to switch modes cleanly, re-run `dotnet restore` in the target mode (or wipe `artifacts/obj`).

### Tests

- **NUnit 4**, and the runner **must be 64-bit** (the native client is 64-bit only).
- ⚠️ **`global.json` opts into the MTP mode of `dotnet test`** (`"test": { "runner": "Microsoft.Testing.Platform" }`) and that opt-in is load-bearing: these projects use the NUnit MTP runner, and **MTP v2 refuses to run under the old VSTest bridge on the .NET 10+ SDK**, failing with *"Testing with VSTest target is no longer supported by Microsoft.Testing.Platform"*. Every test project declares `EnableNUnitRunner=true` in its OWN `.csproj`, next to `IsTestProject`, `IsPackable=false` and `RunAnalyzersDuringBuild=false`, so all targets use MTP uniformly. This block is deliberately per-project and NOT shared from `Directory.Build.props`: a shared block can only be conditioned on the project name, and a test project is not required to be named `*.Tests`. **A new test project must carry the block**, or it falls back to VSTest and exits 0 having run nothing, which is indistinguishable from a passing suite.
- **Scoping `dotnet test` to a single project and TFM** (`dotnet test <Project>.csproj -f <tfm>`) is the standard invocation. A solution-wide `dotnet test FoundationDB.Client.slnx` is not supported (MTP requires every project in the run to use the same runner, and the solution includes non-test projects).
- **Running the assembly directly also works and skips the build**, which is faster in a tight loop: `dotnet artifacts/bin/<Project>/debug_net11.0/<Project>.dll`, filtering with `--filter "FullyQualifiedName~<NamePart>"` (not `--treenode-filter`) and `--output Detailed` for per-assert output. The same `--filter` works through `dotnet test`, with or without the `--` separator.
- ⚠️ **Exclude the benchmark categories from normal suite runs**: append `--filter "TestCategory!=LongRunning&TestCategory!=Benchmark"`. The benchmark fixtures are correctly categorised and interactive runners filter them by default, an agent running the assembly UNFILTERED is the only consumer that pays for them (measured: `SnowBank.Core.Tests` net10 5m19s → 4s, net472 6m20s → 8s, keeping 98.4% of tests). Two exceptions: benchmarks stay runnable on purpose via `--filter "TestCategory=Benchmark"`, and a run whose *subject* needs GC/allocation pressure (e.g. the SliceReader GC-safety detector) runs unfiltered, a filtered run is structurally blind to that class.
- `SnowBank.*.Tests` are pure and need no database.
- **`FoundationDB.Tests` requires a running local FoundationDB cluster** and the native `fdb_c` library (`libfdb_c.dylib` on macOS, `libfdb_c.so` on Linux, `fdb_c.dll` on Windows). `FoundationDB.Client.Native` redistributes these.
  - ⚠️ Tests write to a dedicated subspace but **can corrupt data**, only point them at a throwaway local cluster.
- `FoundationDB.FakeDb` provides an in-memory fake for tests that don't want a real cluster.
- Test classes use the `*Facts` naming convention (e.g. `FdbKeyFacts`, `TuPackFacts`).

### Test project layout (which tests go where)

Three test projects, split by what they exercise:

- **`FoundationDB.FakeDb.Tests`**, the FakeDb emulator's OWN tests only: conformance against real FDB semantics, internals, and the differential scenario harness. Docker-free. (FdbLite's emulator tests will land here too.)
- **`FoundationDB.Tests`**, the client binding: transactions, keys, subspaces, values, tenants, error handling, the native handler, plus "don't know where else to put it" tests. Docker-backed (Testcontainers). The Directory-layer tests (`DirectoryFacts`, `FdbPathFacts`) live here and are SPECIAL: they open the database manually at the root, because a test *of* the Directory layer cannot use the Directory-layer-based partition helper (that would test the layer through itself).
- **`FoundationDB.Layers.Tests`**, the home for every LAYER suite (`Layers.Common`, `Layers.Experimental`). Each suite is written ONCE and runs against BOTH the in-memory FakeDb (fast) and a real cluster (validation).

**Dual-backend pattern** (see `FullText/FdbTextIndexFacts.cs`, and `SmokeConformanceFacts` for the original): a layer suite is an `abstract XxxFacts : FdbTest` whose bodies open an isolated partition with `OpenTestPartitionAsync()` and clear it with `CleanLocation(db, location)`, backend-agnostic. Two thin concrete fixtures pick the backend:

```csharp
public abstract class FooFacts : FdbTest { /* the tests, via OpenTestPartitionAsync() / CleanLocation() */ }

[TestFixture] // FAST default: in-memory FakeDb, no Docker, no native client
public sealed class FooFakeDbFacts : FooFacts
{
    private FakeDbTestBackend Backend { get; } = new();
    protected override bool UseRealServer => false;
    [TearDown] public void ResetBackend() => this.Backend.Reset();
    protected override Task<IFdbDatabase> OpenTestDatabaseAsync(bool readOnly = false) => this.Backend.OpenAsync(FdbPath.Root, readOnly);
    protected override Task<IFdbDatabase> OpenTestPartitionAsync(string? testMethod = null) => this.Backend.OpenAsync(GetTestPartitionPath(testMethod));
}

[TestFixture, Explicit("Requires a local Docker daemon"), Category("RealCluster")]
public sealed class FooRealClusterFacts : FooFacts { } // inherits the real-cluster FdbTest behavior
```

**Workflow**: iterate against the `*FakeDbFacts` fixtures (Docker-free, instant); then run the `*RealClusterFacts` fixtures (opt-in via the `RealCluster` category or the Unit Test Sessions UI) to validate against a real cluster. Real-cluster runs require Docker and the native `fdb_c` client (one-time per worktree: `FoundationDB.Client.Native/DownloadBinaries.ps1` on Windows, or `DownloadBinaries.sh` on macOS/Linux, which needs `curl` + `python3`; pass `--rid osx-arm64` to fetch only the current platform's binaries). The same suites double as a ready-made realistic test bed for a future FdbLite backend (a third `*FdbLiteFacts` subclass).

### The netstandard2.0 / net472 "lite" targets

`SnowBank.Core`, `FoundationDB.Client`, `FoundationDB.Client.Native`, `FoundationDB.Layers.Common`, and `FoundationDB.FakeDb` **also build for `netstandard2.0`** (gated by `CoreSdkNetStandardEnabled`, default `true`). This is a deliberate stopgap for applications migrating from .NET Framework 4.7.2 to modern .NET: their legacy `main` branch can already consume the modern APIs (`Contract.NotNull`, CrystalJson, `Slice`, `subspace.Key(...)`), which reduces merge pain with their modernized `vnext` branch. The lite build must **run** on the net472 CLR (including the native `fdb_c` interop), not just compile, and it must produce **byte-identical keys/values**: what is written to the database must never depend on the TFM.

**Any change to these projects must keep the `netstandard2.0` target building** (`dotnet build <proj>.csproj -f netstandard2.0`). When code needs something the old BCL lacks:

1. **Missing BCL API with many call sites** → prefer a polyfill in [`SnowBank.Core/Polyfills/`](SnowBank.Core/Polyfills/) so call sites compile unchanged. Public extension polyfills live in the `SnowBank.Compat` namespace (imported via a guarded `global using` in each project's `GlobalUsings.cs`; this includes C# 14 static extension members like `string.Create(provider, $"...")` and `Span<char>.TryWrite($"...")`). Statics that can't be extensions are internal `*Compat` classes redirected per-file: `using CollectionsMarshal = SnowBank.Compat.CollectionsMarshalCompat;` under `#if NETSTANDARD2_0`.
2. **Point fallback** → `#if`/`#else`/`#endif` with the original implementation FIRST under `#if NETX_0_OR_GREATER` (X = the version that introduced the feature/API), and the fallback in `#else` with a comment on the next line stating what is missing and the cost ("X is not available, doing Y instead (which allocates)").
3. **Needs runtime support, cannot be polyfilled** (default interface members, `static abstract` interface members, covariant return types, ref fields, `allows ref struct`) → guard the member out, or exclude the whole feature from the lite build (e.g. `FdbValue<TValue, TEncoder>` and `FdbValueCodec.FixedSize`, the FQL `Query/` engine, the JSON source-gen proxies).
4. **Portable `Span<T>` gotchas**: on netstandard2.0, `Span<T>` cannot wrap raw pointers/refs of types containing references *or pointers* (e.g. `Span<FdbKeyValue>`), and `MemoryMarshal.CreateSpan` shims only support unmanaged types, use direct pointer indexing or a temporary array instead.

**Validation**: `net472` test targets exist on `SnowBank.Core.Tests`, `FoundationDB.Tests`, `FoundationDB.FakeDb.Tests`, and `FoundationDB.Layers.Tests` (they consume the netstandard2.0 builds and run on the real .NET Framework CLR). Test files covering excluded features are guarded with `#if !NETFRAMEWORK` (or `<Compile Remove>` in the csproj for whole folders). Run them with `dotnet test <Project>.csproj -f net472 --no-build` (all TFMs use MTP uniformly now). On net472 the fdb test container is driven through the docker CLI (Docker.DotNet cannot run on the netfx CLR). On every TFM, a freshly created test container self-provisions its database on first start (`Fdb.Provisioning.EnsureDatabaseConfiguredAsync`, called from `FdbServerTestContainer.StartContainer`); no manual `fdbcli` step is needed.

Known accepted netfx differences (do not "fix" by changing shared code): doubles may format with 17 digits instead of shortest-roundtrip (`FastDtoa` is excluded), and `IVarTuple` ↔ `ValueTuple`/`ITuple` interop is unavailable (`System.Runtime.CompilerServices.ITuple` is not visible to netstandard2.0).

## Releasing

The published NuGet packages are cut from [`Common/VersionInfo.props`](Common/VersionInfo.props). The reference **sample and sandbox projects are not part of the release**: they pin *published* `FoundationDB.*` package versions (so a reader can `restore` them like their own app), which means they legitimately lag the in-development version. Fold this sweep into the pre-tag routine:

- **Before the tag**, write [`Documentation/releases/<N>.md`](Documentation/releases/) from the commit log (which follows the `Area: summary` house form: `git log <prev-tag>..HEAD --format='- %s'`, grouped by area prefix, then curated into prose, never the raw log). It is the single release-notes and upgrade document: every change from the previous STABLE version (not the previous rc), ordered by what applications use, each behavior change inlining what to do about it, and a final Breaking changes section for the rest. There is no separate migration guide. Follow [`Documentation/writing-style.md`](Documentation/writing-style.md), and add a `releases/<N>.md` entry to [`Documentation/toc.yml`](Documentation/toc.yml). The GitHub release body stays slim: highlights and the breaking-change list, pointing to `releases/<N>.md` for the full detail.
- **After** the new packages are live on NuGet (they must be restorable), and **before** locking the release with a git tag, bump the pinned `FoundationDB.*` versions in the standalone samples ([`samples/getting-started/`](samples/getting-started/)) and any sandbox projects to the just-published version, then `restore` + build them to confirm they still work against the shipping packages. Doing it before the tag keeps the tagged tree pointing at real, restorable versions; it cannot be done earlier because the packages do not exist yet.

## Coding conventions

Style is enforced by [`.editorconfig`](.editorconfig) and the `.DotSettings` files. Match the surrounding code; notable points:

- **Tabs, not spaces.** (This is deliberate and non-negotiable per the README.)
- **Block-scoped namespaces** (`namespace Foo { … }`), not file-scoped. Every file opens with the BSD-3-Clause copyright header `#region`.
- `Nullable` is **enabled**; `ImplicitUsings` is enabled (shared usings live in each project's `GlobalUsings.cs`).
- Public API is documented with XML doc comments (`///`), keep them accurate and add `<remarks>`/`<example>` for non-obvious behavior, as the existing code does heavily.
- **House writing style** (design docs, notes, documentation, code comments, commit messages). Principles: one idea per sentence, prefer short; active voice with a named actor; concrete words, numbers over adjectives; the same word for the same thing (no synonym rotation); every "this"/"it"/"that" has a clear referent; noun stacks capped at three, broken with prepositions; positive form, no double negatives; no trailing "-ing" pile-ups. Banned everywhere: em-dashes, shouted CAPS mid-sentence, emoji, and the `no-slop` word list (delve, leverage, robust, seamless, ...). In comments only, a beacon at the start is a review marker kept verbatim: `REVIEW`, `BUGBUG`, `HACKHACK`, `PERF`, `OPTIMIZE`, `NOTE`. Comments explain the code; they do not point at design, spike, or campaign documents (state the fact or rationale inline). This is a blacklist plus principles: no approved-word dictionary, no length audit, no sign-off process. When in doubt, write the plainest true sentence.
- Allocation-consciousness is a core value: prefer `Slice`/`ReadOnlySpan<byte>`, pooled buffers, and `struct` keys/values over `byte[]`. Many hot types are `readonly struct` implementing span-based interfaces (`ISpanEncodable`).
- **Guard clauses and assertions use the `Contract.*` family** (`SnowBank.Diagnostics.Contracts`, a global using in these projects), **not** raw `throw new ArgumentNullException(...)`, `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(...)`, `ArgumentOutOfRangeException.ThrowIf*`, or `System.Diagnostics.Debug.Assert(...)`. Always-on preconditions: `Contract.NotNull(x)`, `Contract.NotNullOrEmpty(...)`, `Contract.Positive(n)`, `Contract.Requires(cond)`. Debug-only invariants: `Contract.Debug.Requires(...)` / `Contract.Debug.Assert(...)` (and `Paranoid.*` for the hottest paths). They carry `[CallerArgumentExpression]` param names and integrate with the test harness's contract-failure interceptor.
- Don't break public surface casually. Retire APIs with `[Obsolete]` (the codebase uses `error: true` for hard-removed ones) rather than deleting outright.

## Working on the key/value API or layers

The single most important thing to get right (and the most common source of incorrect "vibe-coded" usage) is **how keys are encoded and how a custom Layer is structured**. The rules:

- Keys are built with `subspace.Key(item1, …)` and friends, returning **lazy strongly-typed key structs** (`FdbTupleKey<…>`). They are rendered to bytes only when handed to the transaction (`tr.GetAsync(key)`, `tr.Set(key, …)`). Do **not** eagerly call `.ToSlice()` and pass bytes around.
- A Layer is a thin wrapper over an `ISubspaceLocation`; it implements `IFdbLayer<TState>`, and `Resolve(tr)` returns a per-transaction `State` holding the resolved `IKeySubspace`. The state must **never** escape the transaction.

Full guidance, worked examples, and the list of reference layers to imitate are in the skill **[`.claude/skills/foundationdb-keys-and-layers/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/foundationdb-keys-and-layers/SKILL.md)**. Transaction/retry semantics are in **[`.claude/skills/foundationdb-transactions/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/foundationdb-transactions/SKILL.md)**. For sophisticated/distributed layers (cluster internals, read-batching/latency, change feeds, version-as-clock leases, retention and fencing), see **[`.claude/skills/foundationdb-advanced-layers/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/foundationdb-advanced-layers/SKILL.md)**. For the `Slice` type and its companions (`SliceReader`/`SliceWriter`/`SliceOwner`, Span-first I/O, pooled buffers) that underlie all keys/values, see **[`.claude/skills/snowbank-slices-and-buffers/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/snowbank-slices-and-buffers/SKILL.md)**. For standing up a cluster and connecting to it (the .NET Aspire hosting & client integrations, the native `libfdb_c` client, client⇄cluster version compatibility), i.e. getting the `IFdbDatabaseProvider` the other skills assume, see **[`.claude/skills/foundationdb-aspire/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/foundationdb-aspire/SKILL.md)**. Read these before writing or reviewing key-encoding or layer code, even when working inside this repo.

These skills are also packaged as a Claude Code **plugin** ([`plugins/foundationdb-skills/`](plugins/foundationdb-skills/)) so consumers can install them (`/plugin marketplace add SnowBankSDK/foundationdb-dotnet-client`). The canonical skills live in `.claude/skills/`; the plugin's `skills/` is a **committed copy** kept in sync by the sync script ([`scripts/sync-plugin-skills.sh`](scripts/sync-plugin-skills.sh), or [`scripts/sync-plugin-skills.ps1`](scripts/sync-plugin-skills.ps1) on Windows), **after editing any skill, run that script** (`--check`/`-Check` verifies they haven't drifted) and bump the `version` in `plugins/foundationdb-skills/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

## Docs

Human-facing docs live in [`Documentation/`](Documentation/) as Markdown (listed in [`Documentation/toc.yml`](Documentation/toc.yml)), rendered to a static site by [`SnowBank.DocGen`](SnowBank.DocGen/), a standalone .NET tool in this repo. It is **not** part of `FoundationDB.Client.slnx`; build and run it on its own:

```bash
dotnet run --project SnowBank.DocGen        # renders to artifacts/_site
```

The tool builds the guide pages, an API reference reflected from the built assemblies (`SnowBank.Core`, `FoundationDB.Client`, `FoundationDB.Aspire`, `FoundationDB.Aspire.Hosting`, so build those in Release first for the reference to appear), and a French twin under `/fr/` from the `*.fr.md` files. It shells out to Node for two build-time passes: mermaid diagrams to static SVG (needs a Chrome, pointed to by `CHROME_PATH`) and Shiki syntax highlighting; run `npm ci` in [`SnowBank.DocGen/tools`](SnowBank.DocGen/tools) once. The [`docs.yml`](.github/workflows/docs.yml) workflow runs all of this and publishes to GitHub Pages (manual dispatch).

The top-level [`README.md`](README.md) is the authoritative getting-started narrative, and it is packed into the NuGet package, so treat it as shipped surface.
