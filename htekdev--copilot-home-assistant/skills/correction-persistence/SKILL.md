description: 3-layer lesson persistence pattern — when {{PARENT_1}} or {{PARENT_2}} corrects behavior, persist the lesson across store_memory + standing-orders.md + copilot-instructions.md. Use when user says "persist lesson", "save correction", "never repeat", "remember this rule", "update instructions", "learned behavior", "permanent fix", or any behavioral correction that must be persisted. Use when this capability is needed.

# Correction Persistence Skill

When {{PARENT_1}} or {{PARENT_2}} corrects the system's behavior, the lesson MUST be persisted across ALL three layers to guarantee it is never repeated. This is the platform's meta-rule for continuous improvement.

## The 3-Layer Pattern

Every correction gets stored in ALL of these (not just one):

| Layer | File | Purpose | Who Reads It |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| 1. Cross-session memory | `store_memory` tool | Survives between sessions | All future sessions |
| 2. Standing orders | `data/standing-orders.md` | Heartbeat/cron reference | Agents with standing-order reads |
| 3. Copilot instructions | `.{{EMPLOYER_PARENT}}/copilot-instructions.md` | ALL future sessions | Every agent, every run |

## When to Apply

Apply this pattern when:
- {{PARENT_1}} says "never do X again" or "always do Y"
- A behavior is corrected with frustration or emphasis
- A bug in agent behavior is identified that could recur
- A new rule is established that affects multiple agents
- {{PARENT_2}} or {{PARENT_1}} provides explicit feedback on system behavior

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### Step 1: Acknowledge the Correction
Confirm understanding before persisting. "Got it — [restate the rule]. Persisting now."

### Step 2: Store in Cross-Session Memory
```
store_memory(
  subject: "[relevant topic]",
  fact: "[concise rule statement, <200 chars]",
  citations: "User input: \"[exact quote from {{PARENT_1}}/{{PARENT_2}}]\"",
  reason: "[why this matters, what it prevents, 2-3 sentences]"
)
```

### Step 3: Add to Standing Orders
Edit `data/standing-orders.md` — add a new section under the appropriate heading with:
- Rule title (with "CRITICAL — from [person], [date]" tag)
- {{PARENT_1}}'s exact words (if available)
- The rule stated clearly
- Anti-patterns (what NOT to do)
- Correct pattern (what TO do)
- Scope (which agents/contexts this applies to)

### Step 4: Add to Copilot Instructions
Edit `.{{EMPLOYER_PARENT}}/copilot-instructions.md` under "Learned Behaviors" section with:
- Same format as standing orders
- Include date learned
- Be concise — copilot-instructions is read by every session

### Step 5: Confirm Persistence
Report back: "✅ Persisted across all 3 layers: store_memory, standing-orders.md, copilot-instructions.md. This will never happen again."

## Quality Standards

### Good Persistence
- **Specific**: "NEVER use write_agent for cron dispatches" (not "be careful with agents")
- **Actionable**: Clear what TO do and what NOT to do
- **Scoped**: States which agents/contexts are affected
- **Sourced**: Includes date and person who gave the correction
- **Verifiable**: Another agent can read it and know exactly what's expected

### Anti-Patterns
- ❌ Storing only in one layer (will be forgotten in other contexts)
- ❌ Vague rules ("be more careful") instead of specific ones
- ❌ Missing anti-pattern examples (agents need to know what to AVOID)
- ❌ Not including the date (makes it hard to trace when rules were established)
- ❌ Storing a lesson that contradicts an existing rule without resolving the contradiction

## Deduplication

Before adding a new rule, check if a similar one already exists:
1. `grep` standing-orders.md for related keywords
2. Check copilot-instructions.md "Learned Behaviors" section
3. If a related rule exists, UPDATE it (don't duplicate)
4. If the new correction OVERRIDES an old rule, mark the old one as superseded

## Scope Classification

| Scope | Where to Emphasize |
|-------|-------------------|
| ALL agents, all contexts | All 3 layers + mark as "platform-wide" |
| Specific agent only | All 3 layers + note the specific agent |
| Specific interaction pattern | All 3 layers + include trigger condition |
| Content/publishing only | All 3 layers + note "content agents" scope |

## Examples of Well-Persisted Corrections

- "SPEAK: TTS via speak parameter" — platform-wide, all {{PARENT_1}} messages
- "Finance Auto-Pay Cleanup" — finance-manager + task-coach scope
- "Social Media Replies Are Autonomous" — content agents + task-coach
- "No Assumptions — Clarification First" — ALL agents, ALL domains
- "Child Location — SAFETY CRITICAL" — ALL agents, safety override
