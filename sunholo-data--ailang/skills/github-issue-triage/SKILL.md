# GitHub Issue Triage

**Monitor open GitHub issues, match them to design docs, identify closable issues, and keep the issue tracker synchronized with actual development progress.**

## Quick Start

**Most common usage:**
```bash
# Full triage report - shows all issues, matches to design docs, suggests closures
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/triage_report.sh

# Just list open issues with labels and age
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/list_open_issues.sh

# Find issues that have been implemented (design docs in implemented/)
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/find_closable.sh

# Match issues to planned design docs (shows what's being worked on)
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/match_design_docs.sh --planned
```

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- User asks "what issues are open?", "check our issues", "triage issues"
- Starting a new development cycle and need to understand backlog
- After completing a release to identify closable issues
- Periodic housekeeping to keep issue tracker clean
- User wants to understand which issues are covered by design docs

## Available Scripts

### `scripts/check_auth.sh`
Verify GitHub CLI authentication matches expected user.

**Usage:**
```bash
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/check_auth.sh
```

**What it checks:**
1. `gh` CLI is installed
2. User is authenticated to github.com
3. Active account matches `github.expected_user` in config

**Exit codes:**
- `0` - Auth OK, correct user active
- `1` - Auth failed or wrong user active

### `scripts/list_open_issues.sh [--json] [--labels LABELS]`
List all open GitHub issues with details.

**Usage:**
```bash
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/list_open_issues.sh
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/list_open_issues.sh --json
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/list_open_issues.sh --labels bug,enhancement
```

**Output includes:**
- Issue number and title
- Labels (bug, enhancement, etc.)
- Age (days since creation)
- Last updated date
- Assignee (if any)

### `scripts/match_design_docs.sh [--planned] [--implemented] [--all]`
Match open issues to design documents.

**Usage:**
```bash
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/match_design_docs.sh           # All matches
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/match_design_docs.sh --planned # Only planned docs
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/match_design_docs.sh --implemented # Only implemented
```

**Matching strategy:**
1. Exact issue number references (`#123` in design doc)
2. Title keyword matching (significant words from issue title)
3. Bug ID matching (`M-BUG-XXX` patterns)

**Output:**
```
Issue #29: Parser crash on empty input
  Status: COVERED
  Design doc: design_docs/planned/v0_6_1/m-bug-parser-crash.md
  Match type: exact_reference (#29)

Issue #31: Add async support
  Status: NOT COVERED
  No matching design doc found
  Suggestion: Create design doc in design_docs/planned/v0_7_0/
```

### `scripts/find_closable.sh [--close] [--dry-run]`
Find issues that have been implemented and can be closed.

**Usage:**
```bash
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/find_closable.sh           # Report only
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/find_closable.sh --dry-run # Preview close actions
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/find_closable.sh --close   # Actually close issues
```

**What it checks:**
1. Issue referenced in `design_docs/implemented/` directory
2. Issue mentioned in CHANGELOG.md
3. Issue keywords match implemented features

### `scripts/triage_report.sh [--output FILE]`
Generate a complete triage report combining all analysis.

**Usage:**
```bash
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/triage_report.sh
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/triage_report.sh --output /tmp/triage.md
```

**Report includes:**
1. **Summary**: Total open, covered, closable, orphaned
2. **Closable Issues**: Ready to close (implemented)
3. **Covered Issues**: Have design docs (in progress)
4. **Orphaned Issues**: No design doc coverage (need attention)
5. **Stale Issues**: No activity in 30+ days
6. **Recommendations**: Suggested actions

## Triage Workflow

### 1. Check Authentication

**Always verify correct GitHub account:**
```bash
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/check_auth.sh
```

If wrong account:
```bash
gh auth switch --user MarkEdmondson1234
```

### 2. Generate Triage Report

```bash
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/triage_report.sh
```

### 3. Handle Closable Issues

**Review and close issues that have been implemented:**
```bash
# Preview what would be closed
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/find_closable.sh --dry-run

# Close with proper comments
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/find_closable.sh --close
```

### 4. Review Orphaned Issues

**For issues without design doc coverage:**
1. Assess priority and feasibility
2. Create design doc if work should proceed: `/design-doc-creator`
3. Close with "won't fix" if out of scope
4. Add to backlog for future versions

### 5. Handle Stale Issues

**For issues with no activity in 30+ days:**
1. Check if still relevant
2. Add comment requesting update from reporter
3. Close if no response after additional time

## Bot User Integration (sunholo-voight-kampff)

**Status: ACTIVE** - Bot is configured and ready to use.

**Bot account:** https://github.com/sunholo-voight-kampff

### What Uses the Bot

| Tool | Uses Bot? |
|------|-----------|
| `gh issue close/comment` | Yes (via `gh auth`) |
| `ailang messages send --github` | Yes (via config) |
| `ailang messages import-github` | Yes (via config) |
| Issue triage scripts | Yes (uses `gh` CLI) |

### Current Configuration

The bot is configured in `~/.ailang/config.yaml`:
```yaml
github:
  expected_user: sunholo-voight-kampff
  default_repo: sunholo-data/ailang
```

### Switching Accounts

```bash
# Use bot (current)
gh auth switch --user sunholo-voight-kampff

# Use personal (update config too if using ailang messages --github)
gh auth switch --user MarkEdmondson1234
```

### Benefits of Bot User

- **Audit trail**: All automated actions attributed to bot
- **Rate limits**: Separate from personal account limits
- **Revocable access**: Easy to disable without affecting personal auth
- **CI/CD integration**: Can use same token in automation
- **Unified**: Both `gh` CLI and `ailang messages` use same account

For detailed setup and troubleshooting, see [`resources/bot_user_guide.md`](resources/bot_user_guide.md)

## Configuration

Current config in `~/.ailang/config.yaml`:

```yaml
github:
  expected_user: sunholo-voight-kampff  # Bot account (active)
  default_repo: sunholo-data/ailang
```

## Integration with Other Skills

### With release-manager
```bash
# Before release: find issues to close
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/find_closable.sh

# During release: close issues
.claude/skills/release-manager/scripts/collect_closable_issues.sh 0.6.1 --close
```

### With design-doc-creator
```bash
# Find uncovered issues, then create design doc
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/match_design_docs.sh --planned
# For uncovered issue #42:
/design-doc-creator M-ISSUE-42 "Fix for issue #42"
```

### With sprint-planner
```bash
# Use triage report to inform sprint scope
.claude/skills/github-issue-triage/scripts/triage_report.sh --output /tmp/triage.md
# Include high-priority uncovered issues in sprint
```

## Resources

### Bot User Guide

See [`resources/triage_checklist.md`](resources/triage_checklist.md) for step-by-step checklist.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Correct user active (`gh auth status`)
- Repository access (`sunholo-data/ailang`)
- `~/.ailang/config.yaml` with `github.expected_user`

## Notes

- All scripts check auth before making changes
- Close operations add proper comments with release/commit references
- Designed for AILANG repo but can be adapted for others
- Works with existing `ailang messages` GitHub integration
