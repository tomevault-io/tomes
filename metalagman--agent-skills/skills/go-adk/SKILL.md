# go-adk

Expert guidance for developing agents with `google.golang.org/adk` (Go ADK).

## When to trigger
- The user mentions Go ADK, `google.golang.org/adk`, `adk-go`, or asks how to build agents in Go.
- The task involves ADK concepts like `llmagent`, tools, callbacks, sessions/state/memory, workflow agents, streaming, MCP, A2A, ADK web/API runtime, launchers, deployment, evaluation, or safety controls.

## Core rules
- Treat [references/llms-index.md](references/llms-index.md) as the required ADK coverage map.
- Prefer official ADK Go APIs and examples over ad-hoc wrappers.
- Follow existing repository patterns first (imports, launcher style, layout, env handling).
- For version-sensitive behavior, check release notes and API reference before giving definitive guidance.
- Prioritize Go-specific ADK docs first; if a feature is documented only in another SDK doc, call that out explicitly.
- Keep agent names unique and never use `user` as an agent name.
- Use concise `Description` fields so delegation and tool selection remain reliable.
- Treat ADK Web as development-only unless the user explicitly asks for production runtime choices.

## Workflow
1. **Map task to ADK domain**:
   - Build, run, deploy, evaluate, safety, components, protocols, or reference.
   - Load only the relevant sections from [references/llms-index.md](references/llms-index.md).
2. **Confirm execution style**:
   - Launcher-first app (`cmd/launcher`, `cmd/launcher/full`) or embedded runtime (`runner.Run` loop).
   - Local dev UI, CLI-only, or REST/API server flow.
3. **Build the first working agent**:
   - `llmagent.New(llmagent.Config{...})` with a concrete model (commonly `gemini.NewModel(...)`).
   - Add minimum viable `Instruction`, `Description`, and `Tools`.
4. **Add tools safely**:
   - Use `functiontool.New(...)` for typed custom tools.
   - Use `geminitool.GoogleSearch{}` or other ADK/native integrations only when needed.
   - For sensitive tools, apply confirmations, auth, and policy callbacks.
5. **Wire stateful execution**:
   - Sessions via `session.Service` (often `session.NewInMemoryService()` for local dev).
   - Add `memory.Service` only when cross-session retrieval is required.
   - Add state/context/artifacts management only when required by the workflow.
6. **Apply control points**:
   - Use callbacks (`Before/After Model`, `Before/After Tool`, agent callbacks) for logging, caching, guardrails, and overrides.
   - Prefer plugins for reusable security policy enforcement.
7. **Scale composition**:
   - Use workflow agents for deterministic orchestration (`sequentialagent`, `parallelagent`, `loopagent`).
   - Use multi-agent delegation (descriptions + transfer behavior) only when specialization is clear.
8. **Select runtime/deployment posture**:
   - Local dev: CLI/Web/API.
   - Production: deployment target + observability + safety posture.
9. **Verify behavior end-to-end**:
   - Validate happy-path conversation, tool errors, callbacks, session resume/rewind behavior, and evaluation criteria.

## Output expectations
- Provide exact Go imports, runnable snippets, and command lines that match the chosen runtime mode.
- Call out version-sensitive behavior if the user targets older ADK tags.
- Mention the relevant ADK doc section when guidance comes from `llms-index` categories beyond core Go quickstart pages.
- Prefer small, testable incremental changes over large rewrites.
