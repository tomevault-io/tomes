name: appduct
description: Drive an Appduct-enabled app (React Native, iOS or Android) from the terminal or over MCP — connect a device, list the tools the app registers, call them — and write tools that agents can use well. Use when the user mentions Appduct, wants to pair or connect a device, invoke app-defined tools from the CLI or MCP, or asks to add Appduct to an app or write tools for it. Use when this capability is needed.

# Appduct

Appduct lets you call functions a running app has registered as **tools**. One `appduct`
daemon on this machine holds every device session; the CLI and `appduct mcp` are thin clients
of it and start it on first use. There is no server for you to start.

## The loop

```bash
appduct sessions ls                                # connected devices
appduct tools ls                                   # one signature + description per tool
appduct tools describe <name>                      # one tool's full input/output schema
appduct tools call <name> --input '{"k":"v"}'      # call it; --input is required, use '{}' for no args
```

Every command is `appduct <noun> <verb> [selector] [args]` — `sessions`, `tools` and `events`
work like `appduct daemon run|start|stop|status` already does; there are no other forms.

- If `appduct sessions ls` is empty, connect a device first: read
  [references/cli.md](./references/cli.md), section "Connect a device".
- Every session command takes an optional **selector** (alias or session id from
  `appduct sessions ls`) as its first positional argument. Omit it when one device is connected.
  With several, the CLI fails with `ambiguous_session` and lists the aliases; pass one.
- A signature reads `name(param: type, optional?: type = default) -> { result }`. A trailing
  `[prompt]` or `[deny]` is the tool's policy. `...` means that part of the schema could not be
  summarized: run `appduct tools describe <name>` before calling that tool, and only for such
  tools.
- When the listing footer says tools were left out: run `appduct tools ls --groups`, then
  `appduct tools ls --group <name>` (a parent group includes its subgroups), or
  `appduct tools ls --filter <text>` (matches name and description), or page with
  `--limit <n> --offset <n>`.

## Run a known sequence as one command

Do not run one `appduct` command per turn and think in between. Read the listing once, plan the
whole sequence, then pick the smallest form that fits:

1. **Fixed sequence:** chain with `&&`. Every failure exits non-zero, so the chain stops at the
   first one.

   ```bash
   appduct tools call login --input '{"userId":"u_42"}' \
     && appduct tools call seed_cart --input '{"items":3}' \
     && appduct tools call get_cart --input '{}'
   ```

2. **A later call needs an earlier result:** add `--json` and parse it with `jq`. Success is
   `{ "ok": true, "data": … }` on stdout; failure is `{ "ok": false, "error": { "type": … } }`
   on stderr.

   ```bash
   cart_id=$(appduct tools call create_cart --input '{}' --json | jq -r .data.cartId)
   appduct tools call add_item --input "{\"cartId\":\"$cart_id\",\"sku\":\"SKU-1042\"}"
   ```

3. **A loop, a branch on a result, or a wait for an app event:** write a short `.mjs` script
   with `appduct/client` and run it with `node`. It holds one daemon connection, returns typed
   errors, and has `waitForEvent`. The `appduct` package must be a dependency of the project
   (`npm i -D appduct` if it is not; a global install cannot be imported). Example in
   [references/cli.md](./references/cli.md), section "Scripts and test suites".

4. **Something the user will keep:** the same `appduct/client` code, as a test in their suite.

## Output and errors

- Read the plain-text output. Add `--json` only when a command or script parses it; `--pretty`
  indents it.
- `no_session`, `unknown_session`, or an empty `appduct sessions ls`: no device is connected.
  Connect one ([references/cli.md](./references/cli.md), "Connect a device").
- `policy_denied`: the daemon's policy blocks this tool. Do not retry and do not edit
  `~/.appduct/config.json`; tell the user which tool was denied.
- `tool_timeout`: a call gets 10 s unless the app registered the tool with `timeoutMs`.
  `--timeout <ms>` can only shorten that; the fix is in the app's registration. From a wait
  (`appduct_wait_for_event`), the same error means no matching event arrived within `timeoutMs` —
  there is no registration to fix; see "Wait" under Over MCP.
- `session_suspended`: if the message says the app is in the background, ask the user to bring it
  to the foreground (or bring it up yourself if you can); the session resumes on its own. Do not
  raise the timeout or pair again. Otherwise the connection was lost; retry once the session is
  `active` in `appduct sessions ls`.
- `tool_execution_error`: the app's handler threw; report its message.
- An empty `appduct tools ls` listing is not an error: the app registered no tools.

## Over MCP

Same loop, through built-in tools whose descriptions say how to use them: `appduct_connect`
then `appduct_wait_for_session` to connect a device; `appduct_list_tools`,
`appduct_describe_tool` and `appduct_call_tool` for the app's tools (the app's tools are not
MCP tools of their own); `appduct_list_events` for the events the app declares. With several
devices connected, pass `selector`. A tool with policy `"prompt"` asks the user to approve each
call; if they decline, do not call it again.

Before you wait on an event, list what the app declares with `appduct_list_events` (CLI:
`appduct events ls`; `name` takes a glob like `"cart.*"`, and an exact name also returns the
event's `payload_schema`), so you wait on a name the app really posts. An empty list means the app declares none, not that it posts none.

To see what the app reported after a call, use `appduct_events` (drain) or
`appduct_wait_for_event` (wait for one expected event).

**Drain**: call `appduct_events` with `name`, a whole-name glob (`"cart.*"` matches any name
starting with `cart.`; a pattern without `*` matches that name exactly), *before* the call that
triggers the app's async work, and keep the `cursor` it returns as your baseline — draining only
after the triggering call would return every retained matching event, including stale ones from
before it (e.g. a leftover `checkout.failed` from an earlier attempt). Pass that cursor back as
`since` on your next call, so you never re-read an event you already saw. If `remaining > 0`, the
page wasn't everything waiting — call again with the new cursor. Treat `dropped > 0` as a gap:
events between your last `since` and this page were evicted from the daemon's retention buffer
before you could read them, so a plain "nothing matched" isn't the same as "nothing happened."
The `cursor` is scoped to the `name` you drained with: reuse it only as `since` on a later call
that uses the *same* `name`.

**Wait**: for one expected event, call `appduct_wait_for_event` with `name` and `since` (the
cursor from your last `appduct_events` call *with that same `name`*, or the `seq` from a previous
`appduct_wait_for_event` result for that same `name` — omit it and a match from before this call
can resolve instantly, which usually isn't what you want). A cursor or `seq` from a different
`name` doesn't line up: it can sit past events your new glob would have matched (you miss them
and the wait times out) or short of ones already sitting in the buffer (the wait resolves
instantly on a stale leftover). Before waiting on a `name` you haven't drained yet, drain that
same glob first to get a baseline, exactly as under "Drain" above. Pass a `timeoutMs` long enough
for the app to actually finish, not the default. `timeoutMs` is capped server-side at 1,500,000 ms (25 minutes)
regardless of what you pass. If nothing matching arrives in time, the call fails with
`tool_timeout` — that means the event never arrived, not that the tool is misconfigured; the
"fix the app's registration" advice under Output and errors is for a `tools call` timeout, not
this one. In Claude Code, a call still running after about two minutes moves to a background
task; you get the result later as a task notification rather than the call hanging in front of
you, so keep going with other work in the meantime instead of treating the two-minute mark as a
timeout.

## References

Read a reference only when its trigger applies:

- [references/cli.md](./references/cli.md): `appduct sessions ls` is empty, or you need a command
  or flag not shown above (`sessions link`, `events tail`/`since`, `sessions revoke`, `init`,
  `--open`, QR, MCP `appduct_connect`), or you are writing a script or test with `appduct/client`.
- [references/writing-tools.md](./references/writing-tools.md): the task is to add, change or
  review tools in the app's code (`registerTool`, `useAppductTool`, Swift or Kotlin `register`).
- [references/setup.md](./references/setup.md): the task is to add Appduct to a project that
  does not have it yet.
