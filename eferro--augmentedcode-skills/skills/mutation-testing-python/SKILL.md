# Mutation Testing for Python

Mutation testing answers the question: **"Are my tests actually catching bugs?"**

Code coverage tells you what code your tests execute. Mutation testing tells you if your tests would **detect changes** to that code. A test suite with 100% coverage can still miss 40% of potential bugs.

---

## Core Concept

**The Mutation Testing Process:**

1. **Generate mutants**: Introduce small bugs (mutations) into production code
2. **Run tests**: Execute your test suite against each mutant
3. **Evaluate results**: If tests fail, the mutant is "killed" (good). If tests pass, the mutant "survived" (bad - your tests missed the bug)

**The Insight**: A surviving mutant represents a bug your tests wouldn't catch.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use mutation testing analysis when:

- Reviewing code changes on a branch
- Verifying test effectiveness after TDD
- Identifying weak tests that appear to have coverage
- Finding missing edge case tests
- Validating that refactoring didn't weaken test suite

**Integration with TDD:**

```
TDD Workflow                    Mutation Testing Validation
┌─────────────────┐             ┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ RED: Write test │             │                             │
│ GREEN: Pass it  │──────────►  │ After GREEN: Verify tests   │
│ REFACTOR        │             │ would kill relevant mutants │
└─────────────────┘             └─────────────────────────────┘
```

## Systematic Branch Analysis Process

When analyzing code on a branch, follow this systematic process:

### Step 1: Identify Changed Code

```bash
# Get files changed on the branch
git diff main...HEAD --name-only | grep '\.py$' | grep -v 'test_'

# Get detailed diff for analysis
git diff main...HEAD -- src/
```

### Step 2: Generate Mental Mutants

For each changed function/method, mentally apply mutation operators (see Mutation Operators section below).

### Step 3: Verify Test Coverage

For each potential mutant, ask:

1. **Is there a test that exercises this code path?**
2. **Would that test FAIL if this mutation were applied?**
3. **Is the assertion specific enough to catch this change?**

### Step 4: Document Findings

Categorize findings:

| Category | Description | Action Required |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Killed | Test would fail if mutant applied | None - tests are effective |
| Survived | Test would pass with mutant | Add/strengthen test |
| No Coverage | No test exercises this code | Add behavior test |
| Equivalent | Mutant produces same behavior | None - not a real bug |

---

## Mutation Operators

### Arithmetic Operator Mutations

| Original | Mutated | Test Should Verify |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `a + b` | `a - b` | Addition behavior |
| `a - b` | `a + b` | Subtraction behavior |
| `a * b` | `a / b` | Multiplication behavior |
| `a / b` | `a * b` | Division behavior |
| `a // b` | `a / b` | Integer division behavior |
| `a % b` | `a * b` | Modulo behavior |
| `a ** b` | `a * b` | Exponentiation behavior |

**Example Analysis:**

```python
# Production code
def calculate_total(price: float, quantity: int) -> float:
    return price * quantity

# Mutant: price / quantity
# Question: Would tests fail if * became /?

# ❌ WEAK TEST - Would NOT catch mutant
def test_calculates_total():
    assert calculate_total(10.0, 1) == 10.0  # 10 * 1 = 10, 10 / 1 = 10 (SAME!)

# ✅ STRONG TEST - Would catch mutant
def test_calculates_total():
    assert calculate_total(10.0, 3) == 30.0  # 10 * 3 = 30, 10 / 3 = 3.33 (DIFFERENT!)
```

### Conditional Expression Mutations

| Original | Mutated | Test Should Verify |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `a < b` | `a <= b` | Boundary value at equality |
| `a < b` | `a >= b` | Both sides of condition |
| `a <= b` | `a < b` | Boundary value at equality |
| `a <= b` | `a > b` | Both sides of condition |
| `a > b` | `a >= b` | Boundary value at equality |
| `a > b` | `a <= b` | Both sides of condition |
| `a >= b` | `a > b` | Boundary value at equality |
| `a >= b` | `a < b` | Both sides of condition |

**Example Analysis:**

```python
# Production code
def is_adult(age: int) -> bool:
    return age >= 18

# Mutant: age > 18
# Question: Would tests fail if >= became >?

# ❌ WEAK TEST - Would NOT catch boundary mutant
def test_returns_true_for_adults():
    assert is_adult(25) is True  # 25 >= 18 = True, 25 > 18 = True (SAME!)

# ✅ STRONG TEST - Would catch boundary mutant
def test_returns_true_for_exactly_18():
    assert is_adult(18) is True  # 18 >= 18 = True, 18 > 18 = False (DIFFERENT!)
```

### Equality Operator Mutations

| Original | Mutated | Test Should Verify |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `a == b` | `a != b` | Both equal and not equal cases |
| `a != b` | `a == b` | Both equal and not equal cases |
| `a is b` | `a is not b` | Identity check (especially for None) |
| `a is not b` | `a is b` | Identity check |
| `a in b` | `a not in b` | Membership testing |
| `a not in b` | `a in b` | Membership testing |

### Logical Operator Mutations

| Original | Mutated | Test Should Verify |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `a and b` | `a or b` | Case where one is true, other is false |
| `a or b` | `a and b` | Case where one is true, other is false |
| `not a` | `a` | Negation is necessary |

**Example Analysis:**

```python
# Production code
def can_access(is_admin: bool, is_owner: bool) -> bool:
    return is_admin or is_owner

# Mutant: is_admin and is_owner
# Question: Would tests fail if or became and?

# ❌ WEAK TEST - Would NOT catch mutant
def test_returns_true_when_both_conditions_met():
    assert can_access(True, True) is True  # True or True = True and True (SAME!)

# ✅ STRONG TEST - Would catch mutant
def test_returns_true_when_only_admin():
    assert can_access(True, False) is True  # True or False = True, True and False = False (DIFFERENT!)
```

### Boolean Literal Mutations

| Original | Mutated | Test Should Verify |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `True` | `False` | Both true and false outcomes |
| `False` | `True` | Both true and false outcomes |
| `not a` | `a` | Negation is necessary |

### Block Statement Mutations

| Original | Mutated | Test Should Verify |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Function body | Empty function | Side effects of the function |

**Example Analysis:**

```python
# Production code
def process_order(order: Order) -> None:
    validate_order(order)
    save_order(order)
    send_confirmation(order)

# Mutant: Empty function body
# Question: Would tests fail if all statements removed?

# ❌ WEAK TEST - Would NOT catch mutant
def test_processes_order_without_error():
    process_order(order)  # Empty function also doesn't raise!

# ✅ STRONG TEST - Would catch mutant
def test_saves_order_to_database(mock_database):
    process_order(order)
    mock_database.save.assert_called_once_with(order)
```

### String Literal Mutations

| Original | Mutated | Test Should Verify |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `"text"` | `""` | Non-empty string behavior |
| `""` | `"mutmut was here"` | Empty string behavior |
| `"text"` | `"XX"` | Specific string value matters |

### List/Dict/Set Mutations

| Original | Mutated | Test Should Verify |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `[1, 2, 3]` | `[]` | Non-empty list behavior |
| `{}` (dict) | `{None: None}` | Empty dict behavior |
| `{1, 2, 3}` | `set()` | Non-empty set behavior |

**Example Analysis:**

```python
# Production code
def get_default_tags() -> list[str]:
    return ["python", "testing"]

# Mutant: return []
# Question: Would tests fail if list was empty?

# ❌ WEAK TEST - Would NOT catch mutant
def test_returns_list():
    result = get_default_tags()
    assert isinstance(result, list)  # Empty list is still a list!

# ✅ STRONG TEST - Would catch mutant
def test_returns_default_tags():
    assert get_default_tags() == ["python", "testing"]
```

### Assignment Operator Mutations

| Original | Mutated | Test Should Verify |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `a += b` | `a -= b` | Addition assignment |
| `a -= b` | `a += b` | Subtraction assignment |
| `a *= b` | `a /= b` | Multiplication assignment |
| `a /= b` | `a *= b` | Division assignment |

### Control Flow Mutations

| Original | Mutated | Test Should Verify |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `break` | `continue` | Loop termination behavior |
| `continue` | `break` | Loop iteration behavior |

### Python-Specific Method Mutations

| Original | Mutated | Test Should Verify |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `.startswith()` | `.endswith()` | Correct string position |
| `.endswith()` | `.startswith()` | Correct string position |
| `.upper()` | `.lower()` | Case transformation |
| `.lower()` | `.upper()` | Case transformation |
| `.strip()` | `.lstrip()` | Correct trim behavior |
| `.strip()` | `.rstrip()` | Correct trim behavior |
| `.append()` | (removed) | List modification matters |
| `.extend()` | `.append()` | Correct list operation |
| `any()` | `all()` | Partial vs full match |
| `all()` | `any()` | Full vs partial match |
| `min()` | `max()` | Correct extremum |
| `max()` | `min()` | Correct extremum |
| `.get()` | `[]` (indexing) | Dictionary key handling |

---

## Mutant States and Metrics

### Mutant States

| State | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Killed** | Test failed when mutant applied | Good - tests are effective |
| **Survived** | Tests passed with mutant active | Bad - add/strengthen test |
| **No Coverage** | No test exercises this code | Add behavior test |
| **Timeout** | Tests timed out (infinite loop) | Counted as detected |
| **Equivalent** | Mutant produces same behavior | No action - not a real bug |

### Metrics

- **Mutation Score**: `killed / valid * 100` - The higher, the better
- **Detected**: `killed + timeout`
- **Undetected**: `survived + no coverage`

### Target Mutation Score

| Score | Quality |
|-------|---------|
| < 60% | Weak test suite - significant gaps |
| 60-80% | Moderate - many improvements possible |
| 80-90% | Good - but still gaps to address |
| > 90% | Strong - but watch for equivalent mutants |

---

## Equivalent Mutants

Equivalent mutants produce the same behavior as the original code. They cannot be killed because there is no observable difference.

### Common Equivalent Mutant Patterns

**Pattern 1: Operations with identity elements**

```python
# Mutant in conditional where both branches have same effect
if whatever:
    number += 0  # Can mutate to -= 0, *= 1, /= 1 - all equivalent!
else:
    number += 0
```

**Pattern 2: Boundary conditions that don't affect outcome**

```python
# When max equals min, condition doesn't matter
max_val = max(a, b)
min_val = min(a, b)
if a >= b:  # Mutating to <= or < has no effect when a == b
    result = 10 ** (max_val - min_val)  # 10 ** 0 = 1 regardless
```

**Pattern 3: Dead code paths**

```python
# If this path is never reached, mutations don't matter
if impossible_condition:
    do_something()  # Mutating this won't affect behavior
```

**Pattern 4: None handling equivalences**

```python
# When value is never None in practice
if value is None:  # Mutating to == None has same effect
    return default
```

### How to Handle Equivalent Mutants

1. **Identify**: Analyze if mutation truly changes observable behavior
2. **Document**: Note why mutant is equivalent
3. **Accept**: 100% mutation score may not be achievable
4. **Consider refactoring**: Sometimes equivalent mutants indicate unclear code

## Branch Analysis Checklist

When analyzing code changes on a branch:

### For Each Function/Method Changed:

- [ ] **Arithmetic operators**: Would changing +, -, *, /, //, %, ** be detected?
- [ ] **Conditionals**: Are boundary values tested (>=, <=)?
- [ ] **Boolean logic**: Are all branches of and, or tested?
- [ ] **Identity checks**: Is `is` vs `==` tested (especially for None)?
- [ ] **Membership**: Are `in` and `not in` tested?
- [ ] **Return statements**: Would changing return value be detected?
- [ ] **Method calls**: Would removing or swapping methods be detected?
- [ ] **String literals**: Would empty strings be detected?
- [ ] **List/dict/set operations**: Would empty collections be detected?
- [ ] **List comprehensions**: Would mutated comprehensions be detected?
- [ ] **Exception handling**: Would removed exception blocks be detected?

### Red Flags (Likely Surviving Mutants):

- [ ] Tests only verify "no exception raised"
- [ ] Tests only check one side of a condition
- [ ] Tests use identity values (0, 1, empty string, empty list)
- [ ] Tests only verify function was called, not with what
- [ ] Tests don't verify return values
- [ ] Boundary values not tested
- [ ] None cases not tested

### Questions to Ask:

1. "If I changed this operator, would a test fail?"
2. "If I negated this condition, would a test fail?"
3. "If I removed this line, would a test fail?"
4. "If I returned early here, would a test fail?"
5. "If I changed `is` to `==`, would a test fail?"

## Strengthening Weak Tests

### Pattern: Add Boundary Value Tests

```python
# Original weak test
def test_validates_age():
    assert is_adult(25) is True
    assert is_adult(10) is False

# Strengthened with boundary values
def test_validates_age_at_boundary():
    assert is_adult(17) is False  # Just below
    assert is_adult(18) is True   # Exactly at boundary
    assert is_adult(19) is True   # Just above
```

### Pattern: Test Both Branches of Conditions

```python
# Original weak test - only tests one branch
def test_returns_access_result():
    assert can_access(True, True) is True

# Strengthened - tests all meaningful combinations
def test_grants_access_when_admin():
    assert can_access(True, False) is True

def test_grants_access_when_owner():
    assert can_access(False, True) is True

def test_denies_access_when_neither():
    assert can_access(False, False) is False
```

### Pattern: Avoid Identity Values

```python
# Weak - uses identity values
def test_calculates():
    assert multiply(10, 1) == 10  # x * 1 = x / 1
    assert add(5, 0) == 5         # x + 0 = x - 0

# Strong - uses values that reveal operator differences
def test_calculates():
    assert multiply(10, 3) == 30  # 10 * 3 != 10 / 3
    assert add(5, 3) == 8         # 5 + 3 != 5 - 3
```

### Pattern: Verify Side Effects

```python
# Weak - no verification of side effects
def test_processes_order():
    process_order(order)
    # No assertions!

# Strong - verifies observable outcomes
def test_processes_order(mock_repository, mock_email):
    process_order(order)
    mock_repository.save.assert_called_once_with(order)
    mock_email.send.assert_called_once()
    assert mock_email.send.call_args[0][0].to == order.customer_email
```

### Pattern: Test None Handling Explicitly

```python
# Weak - doesn't test None case
def test_get_value():
    assert get_value("key") == "value"

# Strong - tests both None and non-None paths
def test_get_value_with_existing_key():
    assert get_value("key") == "value"

def test_get_value_with_missing_key():
    assert get_value("missing") is None
```

### Pattern: Test List Comprehension Logic

```python
# Production code
def get_active_users(users: list[User]) -> list[User]:
    return [user for user in users if user.is_active]

# Weak - doesn't verify filtering logic
def test_returns_list():
    users = [User(active=True), User(active=False)]
    result = get_active_users(users)
    assert isinstance(result, list)

# Strong - verifies filtering behavior
def test_returns_only_active_users():
    active = User(name="Alice", active=True)
    inactive = User(name="Bob", active=False)
    users = [active, inactive]

    result = get_active_users(users)

    assert result == [active]
    assert inactive not in result
```

---

## Python-Specific Patterns

### Dictionary Operations

```python
# Production code
def get_config(key: str, default=None):
    config = {"timeout": 30}
    return config.get(key, default)

# Mutant: config[key]  (removes .get, raises KeyError for missing keys)

# ❌ WEAK TEST - Doesn't test missing key case
def test_get_config():
    assert get_config("timeout") == 30

# ✅ STRONG TEST - Tests both paths
def test_get_config_existing_key():
    assert get_config("timeout") == 30

def test_get_config_missing_key():
    assert get_config("missing", "default") == "default"
```

### None Handling (is vs ==)

```python
# Production code
def process(value):
    if value is None:
        return "default"
    return value

# Mutant: if value == None

# ✅ STRONG TEST - Should pass for both (they're often equivalent)
# But test with empty string to verify behavior difference
def test_process_with_none():
    assert process(None) == "default"

def test_process_with_empty_string():
    assert process("") == ""  # Would fail if mutated to == None
```

### Exception Handling

```python
# Production code
def divide(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return a / b

# Mutant: if b != 0 (inverts condition)

# ❌ WEAK TEST - Only tests happy path
def test_divide():
    assert divide(10, 2) == 5

# ✅ STRONG TEST - Tests both paths
def test_divide_normal():
    assert divide(10, 2) == 5

def test_divide_by_zero_raises():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Cannot divide by zero"):
        divide(10, 0)
```

### List Comprehensions with Conditions

```python
# Production code
def get_even_squares(numbers: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    return [n ** 2 for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]

# Possible mutants:
# - n ** 2 → n * 2
# - n % 2 == 0 → n % 2 != 0

# ✅ STRONG TEST - Would catch both mutants
def test_get_even_squares():
    result = get_even_squares([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    assert result == [4, 16]  # 2**2=4, 4**2=16
    # Would fail if:
    # - n*2 was used: [4, 8]
    # - % != was used: [1, 9, 25]
```

## Summary: Mutation Testing Mindset

**The key question for every line of code:**

> "If I introduced a bug here, would my tests catch it?"

**For each test, verify it would catch:**
- Arithmetic operator changes (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)
- Boundary condition shifts (>=, <=)
- Boolean logic inversions (and, or, not)
- Identity check changes (is, ==)
- Membership test inversions (in, not in)
- Removed statements
- Changed return values
- Empty collections
- None values

**Remember:**
- Coverage measures execution, mutation testing measures detection
- A test that doesn't make assertions can't kill mutants
- Boundary values are critical for conditional mutations
- Avoid identity values that make operators interchangeable
- Test None explicitly with `is None`
- Test empty collections explicitly
- Verify side effects with mock assertions

---

## Quick Reference

### Operators Most Likely to Have Surviving Mutants

1. `>=` vs `>` (boundary not tested)
2. `and` vs `or` (only tested when both true/false)
3. `+` vs `-` (only tested with 0)
4. `*` vs `/` (only tested with 1)
5. `all()` vs `any()` (only tested with all matching)
6. `is` vs `==` (only tested with non-None values)
7. `in` vs `not in` (only tested one direction)

### Test Values That Kill Mutants

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| 0 (for +/-) | Non-zero values |
| 1 (for */) | Values > 1 |
| Empty lists | Lists with multiple items |
| Identical values for comparisons | Distinct values |
| All True/False for logical ops | Mixed True/False |
| Only non-None values | Test both None and non-None |
| Only present keys | Test missing keys too |

### Python-Specific Gotchas

| Pattern | Why It's Weak | How to Strengthen |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Testing `is None` only | Doesn't verify `== None` difference | Test with `""`, `0`, `[]` |
| Testing `.get()` only with existing keys | Doesn't verify default behavior | Test missing keys |
| Testing list comprehensions with all matches | Doesn't verify filter logic | Mix matching and non-matching items |
| Testing only happy path exceptions | Doesn't verify exception conditions | Use `pytest.raises()` |
| Testing only `and` with both True | Doesn't verify operator choice | Test with mixed True/False |
