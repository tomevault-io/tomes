## Agent Operating Rules

- Preserve architecture. Do not introduce new layers, parallel flows, or public APIs unless explicitly requested; prefer local repair in the existing owner over shared-infra expansion, and stop if a fix conflicts with an ADR, spec, or invariant.
- Respect ownership. Keep logic, state, and helpers in their natural owner, and do not move serializer-local, context-local, runtime-type-local, or protocol-local problems into global utilities.
- Check the spec before implementation. For wire behavior and xlang mapping, use the specs as the source of truth and never copy one runtime's bug into another runtime just to make tests pass.
- Do not make assumptions about runtime behavior, ownership, registration, metadata construction, protocol semantics, or test coverage. Read the current code, owning docs/specs, and relevant tests before making a design judgment or implementation decision. If the evidence is incomplete, inspect more or state the uncertainty explicitly instead of filling gaps from memory or analogy with another runtime.
- For untrusted deserialization, read `docs/security/deserialization.md` before changing allocation, stream filling, skip, reference, metadata, or policy validation behavior. Variable-length deserialization must not allocate or reserve backing/output capacity from attacker-declared lengths or counts before the byte owner has proven proportional readable bytes with `checkReadableBytes` or the runtime equivalent. Root graph memory reservation is accounting only and may happen before that byte check, but it must not replace the byte check.
- Root deserialization graph memory budgets are approximate gates for materialized graph owners,
  not exact heap accounting, input byte accounting, or raw element counts. `maxGraphMemoryBytes`
  defaults to fixed `128 MiB`; positive values override the default; explicit non-positive values
  are invalid and must be rejected at config/Fory creation. Do not add a disabled-budget sentinel
  path, derive this budget from root input size, or split known-length and stream root behavior.
  Read context/read state owns only raw byte reservation with `reserveGraphMemory(bytes)`; it must
  not expose counted arithmetic helpers or collection, map, array, struct, or object semantic
  reservation APIs. Do not add any non-memory-budget read-context/read-state API for this feature,
  including ref-publication controls, temporary-owner controls, serializer-owner controls,
  conversion helpers, or APIs that encode what kind of value is being materialized. Root facades may
  set/reset the per-operation budget, but they must not pre-reserve root type, root self bytes, or
  root value storage. Because the budget is fixed per root, read state must not mirror the
  configured max into a second active-limit field; use the existing config or one configured max
  field plus the mutable remaining budget. Concrete serializers and generated serializers own
  counted formulas, overflow checks, allocation-owner decisions, and reference publication timing
  for their allocation path. Reserve self storage exactly once at the owner that stores or allocates
  the value: reference/object runtimes reserve parent owner self cost plus reference storage and
  every referenced heap owner reserves its own shallow self cost when materialized; inline/value
  runtimes reserve value storage only in the holder or materializer that actually owns that storage,
  such as collection, map, set, array, smart-pointer, box, dynamic boxing, or reference-object field
  storage owners. Value serializers do not reserve their own self storage, including root and
  generated struct/product read paths. Collection, map, set, and reference-array owners reserve
  nonzero shallow self cost only when that runtime materializes an independent reference/backing
  owner, plus backing/reference/inline storage. Struct, record, POJO, compatible, generated, and
  dynamic object owners reserve a nonzero shallow self cost plus shallow field storage only in
  reference-object runtimes or dynamic/boxed materialization paths; inline/value struct serializers
  do not self-charge. Reference fields use 4 bytes when reference size is not cheap or reliable to
  query; primitive/value fields use their storage width. Parents do not recursively include child
  object, collection, map, string, binary, or primitive dense-array contents. Skip enum/union as
  separate owners and skip dedicated string, binary, primitive scalar, primitive array, and
  primitive dense-array leaf owners. Leaf values skipped by the graph budget must remain gated by
  byte-availability checks on the unread input; if remaining bytes are insufficient, the leaf value
  must not be read or created. Actual process memory can be higher than the graph budget. Do not
  guess allocator, bucket-table, node, debug, or map-entry overhead unless it is a documented
  lower-bound owner allocation. Do not add dynamic stream bytes-read accounting or nested hot-path
  cleanup just for this budget.
- For remote TypeDef/TypeMeta reads, the checked metadata cache is the only owner of remote "already validated" state. Cache hit means the header was previously parsed, body/hash-validated, policy-checked, and published by that cache, so the hot path must skip the body and use cached metadata without extra validation, hashing, limit checks, exact-local checks, allocation, or policy work. A known expected local TypeDef/TypeMeta header/hash match is a local-schema hit, not a remote cache miss: it may skip the body and use the local TypeInfo/TypeMeta without schema-version counting or cache publish. Cache miss is the only path that parses and validates non-local metadata, enforces limits, performs exact-local byte comparison when needed, and publishes remote metadata to the cache. Do not add nullable accepted-header fields, sentinel headers, per-TypeInfo markers, pending metadata state, parallel header-low/header-high slots, or parallel acceptance state for this decision. If a runtime needs a metadata hit hint, cache the concrete checked metadata owner object, such as the TypeInfo, TypeDef, or TypeMeta used by that runtime, and compare its validated header identity directly.
- When a user corrects a non-obvious invariant, encode it in the nearest source comment before continuing, and also update `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/**`, docs, or specs when the rule is reusable beyond one file. Do not rely only on chat history, task notes, commit messages, or benchmark logs for corrections that protect security, protocol behavior, ownership, naming, or hot-path performance.
- Reject semantic hacks. Do not bypass broken semantics by deleting cases, simplifying callers, adding coercion hooks, or using workaround fallbacks; fix the underlying bug and prove it with focused tests.
- Protect hot paths. Avoid per-call allocations, callback objects, result tuples or records, unnecessary runtime branches, and wrapper-class substitutions in hot codec/runtime paths; prefer conditional imports and allocation-free concrete implementations where they fit the language.
- Keep public APIs minimal. Public APIs must match user ownership and mental model, not internal implementation details; generated flows stay type-owned, while manual serializer registration stays explicit.
- Use semantic naming only. Name things after protocol or domain concepts, not history, runtime origin, or workaround style; avoid vague names such as `Internal`, `java_style_*`, `Runtime`, `Session`, `Plan`, `Payload`, or `Binding` when they do not name the real concept. Keep class, method, function, and variable names concise; do not encode the whole scenario or implementation history into one identifier. Never name a class or method with a `Plan` suffix; use the real domain concept instead. For Fory codec/read APIs, do not use generic `payload` naming; name the exact owner and data shape, such as bytes, body, frame, field, string, list, map, compressed bytes, or primitive-array encoding.
- Keep one implementation path. Do not keep parallel helpers, serializers, harnesses, wrappers, or registration flows for the same concept; extend the existing owner path instead of inventing another one.
- Follow current scope exactly. The latest explicit user instruction overrides earlier plans, and when scope narrows, remove leaked out-of-scope edits immediately.
- Preserve user corrections. When a user corrects code behavior, ownership, invariants, or review feedback in a way that should prevent repeat mistakes, encode the corrected rule where future agents will see it: prefer the nearest source comment for non-obvious code invariants, or the owning docs/spec for user-visible or protocol behavior. If the correction changes API usage, defaults, generated output, tests, or cross-runtime behavior, update the matching docs, examples, or source comments in the same task so future agents do not repeat the violation. Keep the note concise, English-only, and avoid comments that merely restate obvious code.
- Verification is required. Match validation to the real ownership path: compile, tests, xlang, native-image, non-VM compile, benchmarks, and remote CI as applicable; reasoning alone is never enough.
- Finish the whole surface. A feature or behavior change is incomplete until code, tests, docs, exports, examples, and build wiring agree, unless the user explicitly defers part of that surface.
- Keep task boundaries strict. Review tasks do not edit code, analysis-only tasks do not silently turn into implementation, and active-branch fixes must land in the active branch/workspace.
- For non-trivial multi-step tasks, write the plan and progress into the canonical durable task file (use a matched skill/workflow file if it provides one, otherwise use a file under `tasks/`) and read that file after compaction before continuing.

## Design Integrity Gates

- Record all core design and decisions in the owning docs when they belong there, especially under `docs/guide/**` or `docs/specification/**`.
- Do not allow implementation drift from the design document.
- Do not compromise design decisions to make implementation easier.
- Do not leave workaround code behind.
- All code must have a clean owner model; the wrong owner model or abstraction is unacceptable.
- Do not leave ugly or temporary code behind.
- Do not leave legacy, dead, useless, or stale code, tests, or docs behind.
- Do not leave avoidable technical debt behind.

## Repo-Wide Hard Rules

- Do not preserve legacy, dead, or useless code, tests, or docs unless the user explicitly requests it.
- Ignore internal API compatibility unless the user explicitly requests it. Do not keep shims, wrappers, or transitional paths only to preserve internal call sites.
- Performance is the top priority. Do not introduce regressions without explicit justification.
- "Refactor" means changing structure, ownership, naming, or API shape without changing behavior, wire format, or implementation strategy unless the user explicitly asks for those changes.
- Do not make design tradeoffs the user did not request. If a refactor appears to require a behavior, logic, protocol, or performance tradeoff, stop and ask.
- Treat existing low-level or optimized code as deliberate by default. During a refactor, preserve the current implementation strategy unless the user explicitly asks to redesign or optimize it.
- Do not replace existing C, C++, Cython, unsafe, or other low-level optimized paths with simpler high-level implementations just to make a refactor easier.
- If a refactor accidentally changes logic or implementation strategy, revert that part and re-implement the refactor around the existing logic.
- Use English only in code, comments, and documentation.
- Do not use emoji in documentation, including headings, feature lists, status
  tables, callouts, or READMEs. Use plain words such as "Supported" or
  "Unsupported" instead.
- After editing Markdown files outside `tasks/`, run `prettier --write <file>` on each changed Markdown file before finishing. Do not format Markdown under `tasks/`.
- User guide docs must explain user-visible behavior, commands, and examples.
  Do not add implementation details, internal ownership rationale, build flags,
  or type-id-space caveats unless they directly clarify a confusion users can
  act on. Translate internal owner-model details into concrete user actions, and
  avoid phrases such as "serializer-owned capability" or "registration alone
  does not..." in user-facing docs.
- Add comments only when behavior is hard to understand or an algorithm is non-obvious.
- Do not remove existing code comments unless they are stale, misleading, redundant, or no longer necessary after the change.
- Only add tests that verify internal behaviors or fix specific bugs; do not create unnecessary tests unless requested.
- Do not add cleanup-sentinel tests that only pin deleted APIs or removed fields.
- Tests must exercise the actual code you wrote or changed. Do not write tests that pass by exercising a pre-existing code path that produces similar-looking results. Before writing a test, identify the exact new code path (annotation, codegen output, new API) and verify the test would fail if that code path were removed. When the change involves codegen or annotations, the test must use those annotations on real structs, run through the codegen pipeline, and verify the generated output drives the expected runtime behavior.
- Keep test method names concise. Name the behavior under test without encoding the whole scenario or expected result in the method name.
- When reading code, skip files not tracked by git by default unless you generated them yourself or the task explicitly requires them.
- Maintain cross-language consistency while respecting language-specific idioms.
- Keep one active ownership path per concept. Do not leave duplicate serializers, resolvers, helpers, or registration paths for the same type family unless the split is deliberate and documented.
- Name new or touched APIs, helpers, and tests after protocol concepts, data-model semantics, or user-visible behavior; avoid names based on runtime origin, bug history, storage details, or temporary workarounds.
- For public cross-runtime or protocol features, update runtime support, compiler/codegen wiring, public exports, docs, specs/type mappings, integration fixtures, and tests together unless the user explicitly defers part of that scope.
- Do not introduce checked exceptions in new code or new APIs.
- Do not use `ThreadLocal` or other ambient runtime-context patterns in Java runtime code. `WriteContext`, `ReadContext`, and `CopyContext` state must stay explicit, generated serializers must not retain context fields, and `Fory` must stay a root-operation facade rather than accumulating serializer/runtime convenience state.
- When a serializer class and constructor shape are known at the call site, prefer direct constructor lambdas or direct instantiation over reflective `Serializers.newSerializer(...)`. Keep reflection for dynamic or general construction paths only.
- For GraalVM, use `fory codegen` to generate serializers when building native images. Do not use GraalVM reflection configuration except for JDK `proxy`.
- In Java native mode (`xlang=false`), only `Types.BOOL` through `Types.STRING` share type IDs with xlang mode (`xlang=true`). Other native-mode type IDs differ.
- Keep class registration enabled unless explicitly requested otherwise.
- Prefer schema-consistent mode unless compatibility work requires something else.
- When debugging test errors, always set `ENABLE_FORY_DEBUG_OUTPUT=1` to see debug output.
- Do not set `FORY_PANIC_ON_ERROR` for normal tests, CI reproduction, or xlang validation.
  It is a focused debug knob only; omit it from verification commands, but do not filter it
  from test harnesses when the user command provides it.
- Never work around failures. Find and fix the root cause. Do not hack, weaken, or bypass tests to make them pass.

## Source of Truth

- Primary references: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`, and language guides under `docs/guide/`.
- Protocol changes require reading and updating the relevant specs in `docs/specification/**` and aligning the relevant cross-language tests.
- If instructions conflict, follow the most specific module docs and call out the conflict.
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` plus updates under `docs/guide/` and `docs/benchmarks/` are synced to `apache/fory-site`; other website content belongs there.
- When benchmark logic, scripts, configuration, or compared serializers change, rerun the relevant benchmarks and refresh the artifacts under `docs/benchmarks/**`.

## Shared Engineering Expectations

- Favor zero-copy techniques, JIT or codegen opportunities, and cache-friendly memory access patterns in performance-critical paths.
- Keep hot paths allocation-minimal. Avoid per-call or per-element object allocation, boxing, wrapper round-trips, callbacks, iterator carriers, or holder objects unless there is a measured reason and no lower-allocation design preserves the same behavior.
- Keep hot-path control flow direct and predictable. Hoist repeated buffer/cache/state lookups into locals for multi-step operations, keep cold rebuild or restoration logic on slow branches, and avoid tiny forwarding helpers that only obscure the owner.
- In unified native/xlang hot paths, branch only where the wire format or protocol behavior actually differs. Do not add mode booleans or mode-specific helper parameters for equivalent behavior.
- Public APIs must be well-documented and easy to understand. When adding a public API, write source-level API documentation in the owning code.
- Implement comprehensive error handling with meaningful messages.
- Use strong typing and generics appropriately.
- Handle null values appropriately for each language.
- Preserve protocol compatibility across languages.
- Read and respect `docs/specification/xlang_type_mapping.md` when changing cross-language type behavior.
- Handle byte order correctly for cross-platform compatibility.
- When a target language exposes one public integer type for narrower integer
  widths or one public floating type for reduced-precision floats, use schema
  metadata or field annotations to carry the exact Fory wire type. Do not add
  scalar carrier wrappers for `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `uint8`, `uint16`,
  `uint32`, `float16`, or `bfloat16`.
- If the reference implementation is not right, do not tweak another language's correct implementation to align with a wrong reference implementation just to make tests pass; fix the runtime that diverged from the spec.

## Git And Review Rules

- Use `git@github.com:apache/fory.git` as the remote repository. Do not use other remotes when you want to check code under `main`; `apache/main` is the only target main branch instead of `origin/main`.
- Treat `apache/main` as the only mainline baseline, not `origin/main`.
- Before any diff, review, or compare work against `apache/main`, run `git fetch apache main` so comparisons use the latest remote main.
- When reviewing a GitHub pull request, always do the review in a new local git worktree. Do not switch the current branch or reuse the current worktree for that review unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- Contributors should fork `git@github.com:apache/fory.git`, push code changes to the fork, and open pull requests from that fork into `apache/fory`.

## Code Review Expectations

- For Apache Fory PR, branch, commit-range, and local-diff code reviews, load `.agents/ci-and-pr.md` and follow its review workflow, red flags, and validation guidance unless explicitly acting as the independent general reviewer required by `AI_POLICY.md`.
- When explicitly acting as the independent general reviewer required by `AI_POLICY.md`, do not load `.agents/ci-and-pr.md` or use copied Fory-specific review checklist prompts. Still obey review-only safety rules, this carve-out, and any general instructions required by the reviewer tool.
- When the task environment supports review subagents, run Fory-guided code review through a fresh read-only review subagent while the main agent coordinates scope, checks findings, and reports the final result.
- Reuse the same review subagent for later review passes on the same feature unless a workflow explicitly requires a fresh reviewer; use a fresh review subagent for each different feature.
- Review-only tasks are read-only: do not create task files, edit files, apply patches, run tests, run builds, run benchmarks, run linters, install packages, commit, push, fix tests, or update docs unless the user explicitly starts an implementation or verification task.
- Review-only agents keep planning and findings in memory or in the final review response. They report missing validation evidence instead of running validation commands themselves.

## Shared Validation Expectations

- Run the relevant tests for every touched language or subsystem before finishing.
- A formatter-only pass after successful tests does not invalidate those test results. Do not rerun tests solely because formatting ran after the tests already passed.
- When multiple independent language test suites are required, run them concurrently when the environment has enough resources instead of running them one by one; keep each language's logs and results separate, and rerun any failed suite with focused diagnostics.
- Run applicable test commands in a subagent with a thinking budget one level lower than the main task budget, using medium when the current budget is unclear, unless the change is docs-only or the user explicitly asks to run them locally.
- Reuse the same test subagent for repeated runs within one task and subsystem so it keeps failure context; create a fresh subagent when switching unrelated subsystems or when prior context may be stale or misleading.
- Use `integration_tests/` for cross-language compatibility validation when behavior crosses runtimes.
- If xlang behavior or type mapping changes, run `org.apache.fory.xlang.CPPXlangTest`, `org.apache.fory.xlang.CSharpXlangTest`, `org.apache.fory.xlang.RustXlangTest`, `org.apache.fory.xlang.GoXlangTest`, and `org.apache.fory.xlang.PythonXlangTest`.
- If Swift xlang behavior changes, run `org.apache.fory.xlang.SwiftXlangTest` too.
- For performance regressions or optimizations, profile or otherwise measure the current branch and a fresh `apache/main` baseline before changing code; optimize the measured hotspot, not guessed code.
- When comparing benchmark results against `apache/main`, use a separate sibling worktree named `fory-benchmark-baseline` by default. Before creating a new worktree, check whether `../fory-benchmark-baseline` already exists and reuse it to avoid repeated benchmark dependency rebuilds. Always fetch and sync that baseline worktree to the latest `apache/main` before measuring it, and store benchmark result files under that worktree so older runs remain available as reference data. Treat stored benchmark results as historical references, not truth, because machine load and benchmark variance change over time. Create a different baseline worktree only when explicitly requested.
- Before benchmarking a checked-out version, install or build the required Fory packages for that version, such as the Java artifacts, Python package, and the target runtime package needed by the benchmark.
- Run and close old/new benchmark comparisons for exactly one language at a time. If that language has a slowdown greater than 1%, keep working only on that language until the slowdown is within 1% before moving to the next language.
- Within one language, compare benchmarks case-by-case in adjacent old/new pairs: run one case on fresh `apache/main`, then immediately run the same case on the current branch before moving to the next case. Do not batch all baseline cases and then all current cases, because machine load drift makes that comparison noisier.
- Treat a same-benchmark slowdown greater than 1% as unresolved until the retained median is within 1% of the baseline. Faster results are acceptable only after verifying that generated code, benchmark shape, safety checks, and protocol semantics did not skip required work. Do not add artificial slowdowns or benchmark-shape changes to force a match.
- Do not change protocol behavior, benchmark payloads, or public APIs solely to manufacture performance wins.
- For performance work, run the relevant benchmark immediately after each change and report the command plus before/after numbers.
- For performance-optimization rounds, append the hypothesis, change, benchmark command, before/after numbers, and keep/revert decision to `tasks/perf_optimization_rounds.md`.
- For refactors on performance-sensitive code, validate not only tests but also that no implementation-strategy drift was introduced relative to `apache/main` unless the user explicitly asked for that change.

## Working Process

1. Read the relevant specs, guides, and focused `.agents/*.md` files before editing.
2. Understand the affected architecture, subsystem boundaries, and existing tests before changing behavior.
3. Review related issues for context when the change is tied to a known bug, regression, or feature request.
4. Follow the language-specific rules in `.agents/languages/*.md` for the touched runtimes.
5. Update docs, examples, and specs when public behavior, protocol behavior, or workflows change.
6. Format and verify the changed areas before concluding.
7. For refactors, identify the invariants that must not change before editing: behavior, protocol or wire format, implementation strategy, and performance-sensitive data structures.
8. If code is already optimized, refactor around it instead of simplifying it.
9. When in doubt during a refactor, prefer preserving the existing implementation over cleaning it up.

`docs/security/threat-model.md` for project-level trust boundaries, non-goals,
and downstream responsibilities. For untrusted deserialization, read
`docs/security/deserialization.md` before reporting or changing allocation,
stream filling, skip, reference, metadata, or policy validation behavior.
