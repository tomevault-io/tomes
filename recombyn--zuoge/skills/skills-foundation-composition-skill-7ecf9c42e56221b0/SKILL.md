# Composition (foundation)

Space relationships first. Components second.

Spacing / grid / whitespace **execution** lives in `layout` (this pack `extends` it). This skill owns the **archetype**.

## Process

```text
… → ART DIRECTION → LAYOUT PLAN (this skill) → DESIGN SYSTEM → EXECUTION → …
```

## Hard rules

1. Choose **one** archetype before any create_*.
2. Write coverage / margin / focal counts into `design_brief.composition.rules`.
3. Primary focal point = 1. Secondary ≤ 2.
4. If deleting one element loses no information → plan to delete (subtraction).

## Poster archetypes

| Id | Use when |
|----|----------|
| `center_hero` | Single object/weapon/product owns the board |
| `rule_of_thirds` | Editorial / photo with asymmetric title |
| `bottom_weighted` | Title/CTA band at bottom; hero above |
| `diagonal` | Energy / motion / festival |
| `full_bleed` | Image-led; type in quiet zones |
| `minimalist` | Extreme negative space |
| `dense_info` | Only when user asks for dense poster |

## Full-bleed / center-hero defaults

```text
hero_coverage: 60–85%
text_area: ≤ 20%
primary_focal: 1
secondary_focal: ≤ 2
empty_space: ≥ 15%
cta: ≤ 1
```

## Landing archetypes

`left_text_right_visual` · `centered_hero` · `editorial_split` · `asymmetric_grid` · `product_showcase` · `type_led` · `image_led`

## Checklist

- [ ] Archetype named in brief
- [ ] Hard ratios written (not vibes)
- [ ] Nodes will follow the plan — not the reverse
