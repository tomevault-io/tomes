description: Remove AI-generated code slop from the current branch by analyzing diffs against main and cleaning up unnecessary comments, defensive code, and style inconsistencies. Use when this capability is needed.

This skill identifies and removes AI-generated code slop from changes in the current branch.

## Process

### 1. Get the Diff

Run `git diff main...HEAD` to see all changes introduced in this branch.

### 2. Analyze Each Changed File

For each file with changes, look for these patterns of AI slop:

#### Unnecessary Comments
- Comments explaining obvious code that a human wouldn't add
- Comments inconsistent with the rest of the file's commenting style
- JSDoc or docstrings added to simple internal functions that don't have them elsewhere
- "// TODO" or "// NOTE" comments that aren't actionable

#### Defensive Over-Engineering
- Try/catch blocks in internal code paths that are already validated upstream
- Null/undefined checks on values that are guaranteed to exist by the type system or calling context
- Fallback values that can never be reached
- Type guards on already-typed parameters

#### Type Workarounds
- Casts to `any` to bypass type errors
- `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-expect-error` comments
- Overly broad union types to satisfy the compiler

#### Style Inconsistencies
- Different naming conventions than the rest of the file
- Different formatting patterns (even if valid)
- Excessive blank lines or grouping that doesn't match file style
- Console.log statements left in production code

### 3. Clean Up

For each identified issue:
1. Read the surrounding context to understand the file's existing style
2. Remove or simplify the slop while preserving actual functionality
3. Ensure the code still works correctly

### 4. Report

After all changes, provide a **1-3 sentence summary** of what was changed. Do not enumerate every change—just summarize the types of slop removed and roughly how much.

Example output:
> Removed 12 unnecessary comments explaining obvious code and 3 redundant try/catch blocks in API handlers. Also cleaned up 2 `any` casts that were hiding actual type issues.
