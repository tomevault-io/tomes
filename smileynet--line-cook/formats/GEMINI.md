# Line Cook

> See [README.md](README.md) for philosophy, influences, and user documentation.

Technical details for working on Line Cook itself.

## Kitchen Theme

**Goal**: Low cognitive load with light theming for disambiguation.

### Why Kitchen Terms?

Command names use creative kitchen terms to help users distinguish Line Cook commands from other plugins. `/line:mise` won't be confused with another tool's `/plan` command.

### When to Use Theme vs. Direct Terms

| Context | Use | Example |
|---------|-----|---------|
| **Command names** | Themed (disambiguation) | `/line:mise`, `/line:plate` |
| **Command descriptions** | Direct (clarity) | "Create work breakdown before starting" |
| **Tutorials & casual docs** | Light flavor text OK | "Check the ticket rail (ready tasks)" |
| **Technical docs** | Direct terms only | "ready tasks", not just "ticket rail" |

The theme is a **recognition aid**, not a **learning barrier**. Always include the actual meaning.

### Terminology Glossary

| Theme Term | Actual Meaning | Use in... |
|------------|----------------|-----------|
| Ticket Rail | Ready task list | Flavor text only |
| House Rules | Project config (CLAUDE.md) | Flavor text only |
| Plate Check | Quality verification | Flavor text only |
| Shift Notes | Commit message | Flavor text only |
| House Book | Git remote | Flavor text only |
| Tasting Dish | Minimal e2e proof | Flavor text only |
| Spice | Domain knowledge addon plugin | Plugin type |
| ORDER_UP | Task ready for review | Internal signal |
| GOOD_TO_GO | Review passed | Internal signal |

## Overview

```
/mise ─────────────────────────────────→ /prep → /cook → /serve → /tidy → /plate → /close-service
  │                                         ↓       ↓       ↓        ↓        ↓            ↓
  ├─ /brainstorm → brainstorm.md          sync   execute  review   commit  validate    validate
  ├─ /sample → walkthrough.md                                              (feature)     (epic)
  ├─ /scope → menu-plan.yaml
  └─ /finalize → beads + specs
```

## Platform Command Naming

Claude Code and OpenCode use different command naming conventions:

| Platform | Syntax | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Claude Code | `namespace:command` | `/line:prep` |
| OpenCode | `namespace-command` | `/line-prep` |

- **Claude Code**: Uses `plugin.json` namespace + flat filename → `line:prep`
- **OpenCode**: Uses file path as command name → `line-prep`

## Platform Architecture

**Line Cook supports THREE separate AI coding platforms:**

| Platform | Type | CLI Tool | Product |
|----------|------|----------|----------|
| Claude Code | Plugin system | claude CLI | Anthropic product |
| OpenCode | TUI application | opencode CLI | anomalyco/opencode |
| Kiro CLI | CLI application | kiro-cli | kiro.dev |

Line Cook provides separate implementations for each:
  - `plugins/claude-code/` = Claude Code plugin
  - `plugins/opencode/` = OpenCode plugin
  - `plugins/kiro/` = Kiro CLI agents

## Dependencies

- **beads** (`bd`) - Git-native issue tracking for multi-session work
- **Claude Code**, **OpenCode**, or **Kiro** - AI coding assistant

## Spice Rack (Domain Addon Plugins)

**Spices** are skills-only plugins that add domain-specific knowledge to Line Cook's planning workflow. They load automatically during `/mise` (brainstorm, scope, finalize) when Claude detects relevant project context.

### How Spices Work

- Each spice is a separate GitHub repo with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `skills/` directory
- Listed in line-cook's `marketplace.json` via GitHub source reference
- Users install alongside the core plugin: `/plugin install game-spice@line-cook`
- Skills activate by keyword matching in SKILL.md frontmatter descriptions
- No commands, agents, or scripts — pure knowledge that enhances existing workflow

### Available Spices

| Spice | Repo | What it adds |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **game-spice** | [smileynet/game-spice](https://github.com/smileynet/game-spice) | MLP scoping, core loop design, MDA framework, game planning anti-patterns |
| **code-spice** | [smileynet/code-spice](https://github.com/smileynet/code-spice) | Readability, naming, refactoring, error handling, anti-pattern detection, code-quality critic |

### Creating a New Spice

1. Create repo: `smileynet/<domain>-spice`
2. Add `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with name `<domain>-spice`
3. Add `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` for each knowledge area
4. Add entry to line-cook's `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with GitHub source
5. Add row to this table and README's Spice Rack section

See [ADR-0014](docs/decisions/0014-spice-plugins-for-domain-knowledge.md) for design rationale.

## Agent Definitions

Line Cook provides agents for each platform:

### Kiro CLI Agents (plugins/kiro/agents/)

| Agent | Role | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **line-cook** | Orchestrator | Route workflow commands to template-synced prompts, enforce guardrails |
| **taster** | Test quality | Review tests for isolation, clarity, structure, anti-patterns |
| **sous-chef** | Code review | Review changes for correctness, security, style, completeness |
| **polisher** | Code refinement | Simplify and polish code before review |
| **maitre** | BDD review | Review feature acceptance and BDD test quality |
| **critic** | E2E review | Review epic-level E2E and user journey coverage |
| **issue-agent** | CI triage | Automated issue triage, classification, and fix proposals |

> **Note:** issue-agent has a steering file (`plugins/kiro/steering/issue-agent.md`) but no JSON agent config, since it runs via GitHub Actions rather than interactive Kiro sessions.

### Claude Code Commands (plugins/claude-code/commands/)

Claude Code uses slash commands instead of agents:

| Command | Role | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| **/line:init** | Onboarding | Verify setup |
| **/line:getting-started** | Onboarding | Learn the workflow |
| **/line:onboarding** | Onboarding | Interactive walkthrough |
| **/line:whats-new** | Onboarding | Browse recent changes |
| **/line:doctor** | Onboarding | Diagnose issues |
| **/line:mise** | Planning orchestrator | Brainstorm→sample→scope→finalize with pauses |
| **/line:brainstorm** | Brainstorm phase | Explore problem space (divergent thinking) |
| **/line:sample** | Sample phase | Walk through user experience (experiential thinking) |
| **/line:scope** | Scope phase | Create structured work breakdown |
| **/line:finalize** | Finalize phase | Convert plan to beads + test specs |
| **/line:plan-audit** | Hygiene check | Audit bead structure, quality, work verification |
| **/line:prep** | Prep phase | Sync git, show ready tasks |
| **/line:cook** | Cook phase | Execute task with TDD cycle |
| **/line:serve** | Serve phase | Review code changes |
| **/line:tidy** | Tidy phase | Commit and push changes |
| **/line:plate** | Plate phase | Validate completed feature |
| **/line:close-service** | Close-service phase | Validate completed epic |
| **/line:run** | Execution orchestrator | Prep→cook→serve→tidy orchestration |
| **/line:architecture-audit** | Code quality | Analyze codebase structure and code smells |
| **/line:decision** | ADR management | Record, list, or supersede architecture decisions |
| **/line:help** | Reference | Contextual help for Line Cook commands |
| **/line:loop** | Automation | Autonomous loop management |

### Claude Code Subagents (plugins/claude-code/agents/)

Claude Code subagents are specialized agents invoked during workflow phases:

| Agent | Phase | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **taster** | Cook (RED) | Reviews test quality |
| **polisher** | Serve | Refines code for clarity before review |
| **sous-chef** | Serve | Reviews code changes |
| **maitre** | Plate (Feature) | Reviews feature acceptance |
| **critic** | Close-service (Epic) | Reviews E2E and user journey coverage |
| **issue-agent** | GitHub Actions | Automated issue triage, classification, and fix proposals |

### Project-Specific Agents (.claude/agents/)

Agents for Line Cook development (not shipped with the plugin):

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **release-editor** | Interactive release coordinator for preparing new versions |
| **inspector** | Read-only reviewer for bot-created issue/PR pairs — evaluates what changed, project value, validity, intent alignment, scope, security, code quality, and root cause depth (used by `/inspect-issues` for PRs) |
| **issue-reviewer** | Read-only triage for standalone GitHub issues — evaluates validity, actionability, relevance, priority, and duplicates (used by `/inspect-issues`) |

> **Note:** The shipped `plugins/claude-code/agents/sous-chef.md` is used directly for this project (no local override).

### OpenCode Plugin (plugins/opencode/)

OpenCode plugin uses markdown commands in `plugins/opencode/commands/` and agent files in `plugins/opencode/agents/`:

| Component | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Commands** | OpenCode commands | `/line-prep`, `/line-cook`, `/line-serve`, `/line-tidy`, `/line-mise`, `/line-brainstorm`, `/line-sample`, `/line-scope`, `/line-finalize`, `/line-plate`, `/line-close-service`, `/line-run`, `/line-getting-started`, `/line-architecture-audit`, `/line-decision`, `/line-help`, `/line-loop`, `/line-plan-audit`, `/line-init`, `/line-onboarding`, `/line-whats-new`, `/line-doctor` |
| **Agents** | OpenCode subagents | taster, polisher, sous-chef, maitre, critic, issue-agent (markdown files in `plugins/opencode/agents/`) |

### OpenCode Subagents (plugins/opencode/agents/)

OpenCode subagents are defined as markdown files with YAML frontmatter (mode: subagent, hidden: true). They are invoked via `Task(... agent="<name>")` during workflow phases:

| Agent | Phase | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **taster** | Cook (RED) | Reviews test quality |
| **polisher** | Serve | Refines code for clarity before review |
| **sous-chef** | Serve | Reviews code changes |
| **maitre** | Plate (Feature) | Reviews feature acceptance |
| **critic** | Close-service (Epic) | Reviews E2E and user journey coverage |
| **issue-agent** | GitHub Actions | Automated issue triage, classification, and fix proposals |

## Role Details

Detailed responsibilities and outputs for each agent role, shared across all platforms.

### chef

- **Purpose**: Execute tasks with TDD cycle (Red-Green-Refactor)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Break task into implementation steps
  - Write failing tests (RED)
  - Implement minimal code (GREEN)
  - Refactor while tests pass
  - Verify tests pass and code builds
- **Output**: `KITCHEN_COMPLETE` signal when task is ready for review

### polisher

- **Purpose**: Refine code for clarity before review
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Reduce unnecessary complexity and nesting
  - Improve naming clarity
  - Remove dead code and redundancy
  - Follow project conventions from CLAUDE.md
  - Avoid nested ternaries (prefer if/else or switch)
- **Scope**: Only touches files modified in current changes
- **Constraint**: Never changes functionality—only how code is written
- **Output**: Summary of refinements made (file:line - change)

### sous-chef

- **Purpose**: Review code changes before committing
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Check correctness (logic, edge cases, error handling)
  - Check security (input validation, secrets, injection risks)
  - Verify style (naming, consistency with codebase patterns)
  - Assess completeness (fully addresses the task?)
- **Critical issues**: Block tidy phase (require fixes)
- **Output**: `APPROVED`, `NEEDS_CHANGES`, or `BLOCKED` assessment

### taster

- **Purpose**: Review test quality before implementation
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Check tests are isolated, fast, repeatable
  - Verify clear test names and error messages
  - Ensure proper structure (Setup-Execute-Validate-Cleanup)
  - Identify anti-patterns
- **Trigger**: Automatically after RED phase (write failing test)
- **Output**: Test quality assessment with critical issue blocking if needed

### maitre

- **Purpose**: Review feature (BDD) test quality before plate phase
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Verify all acceptance criteria have tests
  - Check Given-When-Then structure
  - Ensure tests map to acceptance criteria
  - Verify user perspective documented
  - Check error scenarios included
- **Trigger**: Automatically before plate phase (feature completion)
- **Output**: BDD quality assessment with critical issue blocking if needed

### critic

- **Purpose**: Review epic-level E2E and smoke test coverage
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Validate critical user journeys are tested
  - Check cross-feature integration points
  - Verify smoke tests exist for critical paths
  - Ensure testing approach fits project type
  - Identify antipatterns (ice cream cone, flaky tests)
- **Trigger**: Automatically during close-service (when last feature completes)
- **Output**: E2E coverage assessment (PASS, NEEDS_WORK, or FAIL)
- **Documentation**: See [FAQ — Advanced](docs/faq.md#how-do-i-validate-an-epic)

### issue-agent

- **Purpose**: Automated GitHub issue triage via GitHub Actions
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Search codebase for relevant context (including ADRs, conventions, callers, git history)
  - Safety check for prompt injection, scope expansion, credential requests
  - Classify issue type (bug, enhancement, question)
  - Apply appropriate labels
  - Propose a solution for every issue, framed in terms of user value
  - Post analysis comment with findings
  - Always attempt a candidate fix PR (bias toward action — PRs are reviewed before merge)
- **Trigger**: GitHub Actions on issue open/reopen or `@claude` mention
- **Output**: Label + analysis comment + candidate fix PR (or proposed direction if genuinely blocked)
- **Documentation**: See [Issue Agent Installation](docs/installation/issue-agent.md)

## Workflow Principles

1. **Sync before work** - Always start with current state
2. **Track with beads** - Strategic work lives in issue tracker
3. **Guardrails on completion** - Verify before marking done
4. **Push before stop** - Work isn't done until pushed
5. **File, don't block** - Discovered issues become beads, not interruptions
6. **Bot identity for issues** - All comments on GitHub issues must post as `line-sous-chef[bot]` via the `respond.yml` workflow. Never use `gh issue comment` directly from local CLI — it posts as the authenticated user. Use `/respond` or dispatch `gh workflow run respond.yml ...` instead. PR comments (`gh pr comment`) from maintainers are fine as-is.

## Beads Reference

See [Beads Reference](docs/reference/beads.md) for hierarchy, CLI commands, and best practices.

## Session Completion (Landing the Plane)

**When ending a work session**, complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything needing follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Command Synchronization

Line Cook maintains commands for Claude Code (`plugins/claude-code/commands/`), OpenCode (`plugins/opencode/commands/`), and Kiro (`plugins/kiro/prompts/`). All are generated from shared templates to prevent drift.

**Template system:**
- Source templates live in `core/templates/commands/` (22 templates)
- Use placeholders for platform-specific differences:
  - `@NAMESPACE@` - Command prefix (`line:` for Claude Code, `line-` for OpenCode/Kiro)
  - `@IF_CLAUDECODE@`...`@ENDIF_CLAUDECODE@` - Claude Code only content
  - `@IF_OPENCODE@`...`@ENDIF_OPENCODE@` - OpenCode and Kiro shared content
  - `@IF_KIRO@`...`@ENDIF_KIRO@` - Kiro only content
  - `@IF_NOT_KIRO@`...`@ENDIF_NOT_KIRO@` - Claude Code and OpenCode only (excluded from Kiro)

**Platform differences handled automatically:**
- Claude Code: `/line:cook` (colon separator), includes `Skill()` calls and subagent details
- OpenCode: `/line-cook` (hyphen separator), simplified step numbering
- Kiro: `@line-cook` (at-sign prefix), same content as OpenCode but no YAML frontmatter

**Synced commands:** All 22 — architecture-audit, brainstorm, close-service, cook, decision, doctor, finalize, getting-started, help, init, loop, mise, onboarding, plan-audit, plate, prep, run, sample, scope, serve, tidy, whats-new

### Agent Template Synchronization

Review agents are also generated from shared templates to prevent drift between Claude Code, OpenCode, and Kiro.

**Agent template system:**
- Source templates live in `core/templates/agents/` (6 templates)
- Same conditional block syntax as commands: `@IF_CLAUDECODE@`, `@IF_OPENCODE@`, `@IF_KIRO@`, `@IF_NOT_KIRO@`
- No `@NAMESPACE@` substitution needed (agents don't reference command namespaces)

**Platform differences handled automatically:**
- Claude Code: YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, `tools`, plus concise review format
- OpenCode: YAML frontmatter with `description`, `mode`, `hidden`, `tools`, `permission`, concise review format (mirrors Claude Code)
- Kiro: No frontmatter (steering files only), includes context-loading instructions (`bd show`, `git diff`), detailed checklists, red flags, code examples, and anti-pattern sections

**Synced agents:** All 6 agents — sous-chef, taster, maitre, polisher, critic, issue-agent (to all three platforms). Note: issue-agent is a CI triage agent, not a review agent invoked during workflow phases.

**NOT templatized:**
- Kiro JSON agent configs (`plugins/kiro/agents/*.json`) — platform-specific metadata
- Kiro orchestrator steering (line-cook.md) — routing table only, delegates to template-synced prompts
- Non-agent steering files (beads.md, session.md) — Kiro-only reference docs (CC equivalents in docs/guidance/ and AGENTS.md)

**When to sync:**
- After editing any command template
- Before committing command changes (pre-commit hook enforces this)
- As part of release process

```bash
./dev/sync-commands.sh
```

## Installation

> See [README.md#installation](README.md#installation) for end-user installation instructions.

### Local Development Install

After cloning the repo and editing templates, install locally to test changes:

**Claude Code** — Plugin installed via marketplace; no local install step needed for command content changes. Re-run `/clear` in a new session to pick up edits.

**Kiro:**
```bash
python3 plugins/kiro/install.py --global   # Install to ~/.kiro/
python3 plugins/kiro/install.py --local    # Install to .kiro/ (current project only)
```

**OpenCode** (requires [bun](https://bun.sh)):
```bash
plugins/opencode/install.sh               # Build + install to ~/.config/opencode/
```

> **Tip:** If `bun` is installed but not on PATH (e.g. Claude Code's bash environment doesn't source `.zshrc`), prefix with `PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH"`.

### After Template Changes

Always sync before installing:
```bash
./dev/sync-commands.sh                     # Regenerate platform-specific files
python3 plugins/kiro/install.py --global   # Re-install Kiro
plugins/opencode/install.sh               # Re-install OpenCode
```

> **Important - Command Discovery:** Claude Code caches commands based on `plugin.json` version. After adding new commands, bump the version and run `/clear` in a new session.

```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests only (fast, read-only)
./tests/run-tests.sh --provider opencode --tier unit
./tests/run-tests.sh --provider kiro --tier unit

# Prompt eval scenarios (isolated environments, artifact validation)
./tests/eval/eval.sh --provider claude --scenario readonly --runs 1
./tests/eval/eval.sh --provider kiro --scenario analysis --runs 1

# Narrative eval scenarios (multi-step command workflows)
./tests/eval/eval.sh --scenario onboard --runs 1 --skip-missing
./tests/eval/eval.sh --scenario single-task --provider claude --runs 1
./tests/eval/eval.sh --scenario task-chain --provider claude --runs 1
./tests/eval/eval.sh --scenario planning --provider claude --runs 1

# Full report from existing results
./tests/eval/eval.sh --report-only
```

### Narrative Eval

Narrative scenarios test Line Cook's slash commands in realistic user journeys. Each narrative runs multiple steps (commands) in sequence against an isolated test environment.

**How it works:** Headless mode lacks native slash commands. Each step injects the command's markdown directly into the prompt so the LLM follows the command's instructions.

| # | Narrative | Commands Tested | Fixture |
|---|-----------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | `onboard` | getting-started, prep | demo-simple |
| 2 | `single-task` | prep, cook, serve, tidy | demo-simple |
| 3 | `task-chain` | prep, cook, serve, tidy (x2), plate | demo-simple |
| 4 | `full-run` | run | demo-simple |
| 5 | `planning` | brainstorm, sample, scope, finalize | demo-planning |
| 6 | `recovery` | prep, cook, serve (reject), cook (retry) | demo-simple |

**Command coverage:**

| Command | Narratives |
|---------|-----------|
| getting-started | onboard |
| prep | onboard, single-task, task-chain, recovery |
| cook | single-task, task-chain, recovery |
| serve | single-task, task-chain, recovery |
| tidy | single-task, task-chain |
| plate | task-chain |
| run | full-run |
| brainstorm | planning |
| sample | planning |
| scope | planning |
| finalize | planning |

All providers are subscription-based; cost estimates in the report are informational only.

### Provider-Specific Testing Notes

**OpenCode** requires a pseudo-TTY to flush stdout during tool-call responses. All OpenCode invocations in the test harness use `script -q -c` as a wrapper. Without this, OpenCode buffers indefinitely when not attached to a terminal.

Override the default model with `OPENCODE_MODEL`:
```bash
OPENCODE_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-chat ./tests/run-tests.sh --provider opencode --tier unit
```

**Kiro CLI** uses `@line-<command>` prompt syntax (not slash commands). The `get_provider_command` function in `test-utils.sh` maps command names to the correct provider-specific syntax:

| Provider | `--provider` flag | Command format | Example |
|----------|------------------|---------------|---------|
| Claude Code | `claude` | `/line:<command>` | `/line:getting-started` |
| OpenCode | `opencode` | `/line-<command>` | `/line-getting-started` |
| Kiro CLI | `kiro` | `@line-<command>` | `@line-getting-started` |

### Known Patterns

- **Bash arithmetic under `set -e`**: Use `VAR=$((VAR + 1))` instead of `((VAR++))`. When `VAR=0`, `((0++))` evaluates to 0 which is falsy, causing `set -e` to exit the script.
- **LLM non-determinism**: Unit tests use `MAX_RETRIES=2` to handle flaky LLM responses. If output doesn't match expected patterns on first try, the test retries.
- **Eval vs. unit tests**: Eval scenarios (readonly, analysis, implement, sequence) use isolated git repos and validate artifacts. Narrative eval scenarios test multi-step command workflows. Unit tests check command output patterns. Prefer eval for CI; unit tests are for quick smoke checks.

## Release Process

**Releases are targeted events triggered by human decision, not automatic enforcement.** Track changes in CHANGELOG.md, then release when ready.

### Changelog-Based Workflow

```bash
# During development: Add entries to CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased] section
vim CHANGELOG.md  # Add your changes under [Unreleased]

# When ready to release:
# 1. Update CHANGELOG.md: Create new version section from [Unreleased]
# 2. Bump versions in plugin.json files (must be identical)
# 3. Commit, sync beads, push (release created automatically)
```

### Files Requiring Version Update

| File | Field(s) |
|------|----------|
| `plugins/claude-code/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | `version` |
| `plugins/opencode/package.json` | `version` AND `opencode.version` |
| `plugins/kiro/install.py` | `VERSION` constant |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | New version section from [Unreleased] |

### Release Procedure

**Primary (release.py):**

```bash
./dev/release.py <version>            # Prepare release (interactive)
./dev/release.py <version> --push     # Prepare + push (triggers GH release)
./dev/release.py <version> --dry-run  # Preview what would change
./dev/release.py --check              # Validate current state only
./dev/release.py --bundle             # Bundle line_loop only (for dev testing)
```

The script handles: version sync across all manifests → CHANGELOG transformation → line_loop bundling → validation scripts → commit creation.

> **Note:** GitHub Actions automatically creates a release when `plugins/claude-code/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is updated on `main`. See `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

**Manual (Fallback):**

Use only if release.py is broken or needs to be bypassed.

```bash
# 1. Determine version (semantic versioning)
#    Patch: bug fixes → 0.4.5 → 0.4.6
#    Minor: new features → 0.4.5 → 0.5.0
#    Major: breaking changes → 0.4.5 → 1.0.0

# 2. Update all version locations (must be identical)
#    - plugins/claude-code/.claude-plugin/plugin.json: "version"
#    - plugins/opencode/package.json: "version" AND "opencode.version"

# 3. Update CHANGELOG.md
#    - Create new section: ## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD
#    - Move entries from [Unreleased] to new section
#    - Update version comparison links at bottom

# 4. Bundle line_loop (easy to forget!)
python3 -c "from pathlib import Path; import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'dev'); from release import bundle_line_loop; bundle_line_loop(Path('.'))"

# 5. Run validation
./dev/check-plugin-health.py --skip-changelog
./dev/check-platform-parity.py
./dev/doctor-docs.py

# 6. Commit and push
git add CHANGELOG.md plugins/claude-code/.claude-plugin/plugin.json plugins/opencode/package.json plugins/kiro/install.py plugins/claude-code/scripts/line-loop.py
git commit -m "chore(release): vX.Y.Z"
bd sync
git push
```

### Per-Platform Publishing

How each plugin reaches end users after `git push`:

| Platform | Distribution | Update Path | Trigger |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Claude Code** | Marketplace | `/plugin update line` | GitHub Actions creates release when `plugin.json` version changes on `main` → marketplace picks it up → users update via CLI |
| **OpenCode** | Git clone | `git pull && plugins/opencode/install.sh` | `dist/` artifact is committed so users don't need `bun`. Pull gets new version, install script copies to `~/.config/opencode/` |
| **Kiro** | Git clone | `git pull && python3 plugins/kiro/install.py` | Pull gets new version, install script handles path transforms for global vs local install |

### What to Track in CHANGELOG.md

**Audience:** Plugin users who install Line Cook and use its commands/agents in their own projects.

**Track:** New/changed commands, behavior changes users interact with, new workflow capabilities, breaking changes, bug fixes users would encounter.

**Don't track:** Documentation-only, CI/CD, .beads/ changes, test files only, eval tooling, dev-facing skills/docs, template syncing, build infrastructure, agent review rule changes, dev scripts, internal refactoring.

**Litmus test:** Would a plugin user notice this change while using Line Cook? If "only by reading source code" or "only by contributing" — exclude it.

Full guidance with examples: See `docs/guidance/changelog.md`

### When to Release

**Release when:**
- [Unreleased] section has substantial changes worth shipping
- You've completed a feature or fix users need
- Ready to deploy to production

**You can commit without releasing:**
- Iterative development (track in CHANGELOG [Unreleased])
- Work-in-progress commits (no version bump needed)
- Small refactorings that don't affect users

### Version Bump Requirements

Claude Code caches the available commands list based on the plugin version. This affects when you need to bump versions:

**Must bump version:**
- Adding new commands (files in `plugins/claude-code/commands/`)
- Adding new agents (files in `plugins/claude-code/agents/`)
- Adding new scripts that skills depend on
- Any change you want users to see immediately

**Can skip version bump:**
- Editing existing command content (behavior changes work after install script re-run)
- Documentation changes
- Internal refactoring

**How caching works:**
1. When plugin is installed, Claude Code reads `plugin.json` version and scans directories
2. Command list is cached per version number
3. Re-running install script copies new files but doesn't trigger rescan
4. Bumping version forces Claude Code to rescan and discover new commands
5. Users must start new session (`/clear`) after plugin update

### Changelog Format

The changelog uses [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New feature description

### Changed
- Behavior change description

### Fixed
- Bug fix description

## [0.6.3] - 2026-01-19

### Added
- Released feature
```

### Post-Release: User Instructions

After pushing a release, create a GitHub release with these instructions for users:

**Installation (new users):**
```bash
/plugin marketplace add smileynet/line-cook
/plugin install line@line-cook
```

**Update (existing users):**
```bash
/plugin update line
```

> **Note:** The `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow automatically creates releases when `plugin.json` version changes on main.

## Line Cook Workflow

> **Context Recovery**: Run `/line:prep` after compaction

### Core Guardrails
1. **Sync before work** - Always start with current state
2. **One task at a time** - Focus prevents scope creep
3. **Verify before done** - Tests pass, code compiles
4. **File, don't block** - Discoveries become beads
5. **Push before stop** - Work isn't done until pushed

### TDD Cycle with Quality Gates

Line Cook follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle with automatic quality checks:

**RED**: Write failing test
- Write test for the feature you're implementing
- Verify the test fails
- Trigger taster agent for test quality review
- Address critical issues before proceeding

**GREEN**: Implement minimal code
- Write the simplest code to make the test pass
- Verify tests pass
- No refactoring yet

**REFACTOR**: Clean up code
- Improve code structure while tests pass
- Ensure tests still pass after refactoring
- Verify all tests pass and code builds

**QUALITY GATES**:
- Tests pass: `<test command>` (e.g., `go test ./...`, `pytest`, `npm test`, `cargo test`)
- Code builds: `<build command>` (e.g., `go build ./...`, `npm run build`, `cargo build`)
- Test quality approved by taster agent
- Code quality approved by sous-chef agent (in serve phase)

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**

```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**

```bash
bd create "Issue title" --description="Detailed context" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" --description="What this issue is about" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**

```bash
bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" --description="Details about what was found" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs with git:

- Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)
- Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)
- No manual export/import needed!

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems

For more details, see README.md and docs/QUICKSTART.md.
