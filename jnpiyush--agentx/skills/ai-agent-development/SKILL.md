# AI Agent Development

> **Purpose**: Build production-ready AI agents with Microsoft Foundry and Agent Framework. 
> **Scope**: Agent architecture, model selection, orchestration, observability, evaluation.

---

## When to Use This Skill

- Building AI agents with Microsoft Foundry or Agent Framework
- Selecting LLM models for agent scenarios
- Implementing multi-agent orchestration workflows
- Adding tracing and observability to AI agents
- Evaluating agent quality and response accuracy

## Decision Tree

```
Need an AI agent?
+-- Simple request-response? -> Single agent with tools
+-- Multi-step reasoning? -> Chain-of-thought agent with planner
+-- Multiple specialized domains? -> Multi-agent orchestration
+-- Human approval needed? -> Human-in-the-loop workflow
+-- High reliability required? -> Reflection + self-correction loop
+-- Real-time streaming? -> Async event-driven agent architecture
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.14+ or .NET 10+
- agent-framework-azure-ai package
- Microsoft Foundry workspace with deployed model

## Quick Start

### Installation

**Python** (Recommended):
```bash
pip install agent-framework-azure-ai --pre # --pre required during preview
```

**.NET**:
```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.Agents.AI.AzureAI --prerelease
dotnet add package Microsoft.Agents.AI.Workflows --prerelease
```

### Model Selection

**Top Production Models** (Microsoft Foundry):

| Model | Best For | Context | Cost/1M |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| **gpt-5.2** | Enterprise agents, structured outputs | 200K/100K | TBD |
| **gpt-5.1-codex-max** | Agentic coding workflows | 272K/128K | $3.44 |
| **claude-opus-4-5** | Complex agents, coding, computer use | 200K/64K | $10 |
| **gpt-5.1** | Multi-step reasoning | 200K/100K | $3.44 |
| **o3** | Advanced reasoning | 200K/100K | $3.5 |

**Deploy Model**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` -> `AI Toolkit: Deploy Model`

## Agent Patterns

### Single Agent

```python
from pathlib import Path
from agent_framework.openai import OpenAIChatClient

# Load prompt from file - NEVER embed prompts as inline strings
prompt = Path("prompts/assistant.md").read_text(encoding="utf-8")

client = OpenAIChatClient(
 model="gpt-5.1",
 api_key=os.getenv("FOUNDRY_API_KEY"),
 endpoint=os.getenv("FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT")
)

agent = {
 "name": "Assistant",
 "instructions": prompt, # Loaded from prompts/assistant.md
 "tools": [] # Add tools as needed
}

response = await client.chat(
 messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
 agent=agent
)
```

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

```python
from pathlib import Path
from agent_framework.workflows import SequentialWorkflow

# Each agent loads its prompt from a dedicated file
researcher = {
 "name": "Researcher",
 "instructions": Path("prompts/researcher.md").read_text(encoding="utf-8")
}
writer = {
 "name": "Writer",
 "instructions": Path("prompts/writer.md").read_text(encoding="utf-8")
}

workflow = SequentialWorkflow(
 agents=[researcher, writer],
 handoff_strategy="on_completion"
)

result = await workflow.run(query="Write about AI agents")
```

**Advanced Patterns**: Search [github.com/microsoft/agent-framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) for:
- Group Chat, Concurrent, Conditional, Loop
- Human-in-the-Loop, Reflection, Fan-out/Fan-in
- MCP, Multimodal, Custom Executors

## Core Rules

### Prompt & Template File Management

> **RULE**: NEVER embed prompts or output templates as inline strings in code. Always store them as separate files.

**Why**: Prompts are content, not code. Separating them enables:
- Version control diffs that show exactly what changed in a prompt
- Non-developer editing (PMs, prompt engineers) without touching code
- A/B testing different prompts without code changes
- Reuse across agents, languages, and test harnesses
- Clear separation of concerns (logic vs. content)

**Directory Convention**:
```
project/
 prompts/ # All system/agent prompts
 assistant.md # One file per agent role
 researcher.md
 writer.md
 reviewer.md
 templates/ # Output templates used by agents
 report-template.md # Structured output templates
 email-template.md
 summary-template.md
 config/
 models.yaml # Model configuration
```

**Loading Pattern**:
```python
from pathlib import Path

# Load prompt
prompt = Path("prompts/assistant.md").read_text(encoding="utf-8")

# Load output template and inject into prompt
template = Path("templates/report-template.md").read_text(encoding="utf-8")
prompt_with_template = f"{prompt}\n\n## Output Format\n{template}"
```

**Rules**:
- MUST store all system prompts in `prompts/` directory as `.md` or `.txt` files
- MUST store output format templates in `templates/` directory
- MUST NOT embed prompt text longer than one sentence directly in code
- SHOULD use Markdown format for prompts (readable, supports structure)
- SHOULD name files after the agent role: `prompts/{agent-name}.md`
- SHOULD include a brief comment header in each prompt file (purpose, version, model target)
- MAY use template variables (`{variable}`) for dynamic content injected at runtime

### Development

[PASS] **DO**:
- Plan agent architecture before coding (Research -> Design -> Implement)
- Use Microsoft Foundry models for production
- Implement tracing from day one
- Test with evaluation datasets before deployment
- Use structured outputs for reliable agent responses
- Implement error handling and retry logic
- Version your agents and track changes
- **Store all prompts as separate files in `prompts/` directory**
- **Store output templates as separate files in `templates/` directory**

[FAIL] **DON'T**:
- Hardcode API keys or endpoints
- Embed prompts or output templates as multi-line strings in code
- Skip tracing setup (critical for debugging)
- Deploy without evaluation
- Use GitHub models in production (free tier has limits)
- Ignore token limits and context windows
- Mix agent logic with business logic

### Security

- Store credentials in environment variables or Azure Key Vault
- Validate all tool inputs and outputs
- Implement rate limiting for agent APIs
- Log agent actions for audit trails
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) for Foundry resources
- Review OWASP Top 10 for AI: [owasp.org/AI-Security-and-Privacy-Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-ai-security-and-privacy-guide/)

### Performance

- Cache model responses when appropriate
- Use batch processing for multiple requests
- Monitor token usage and costs
- Implement timeout handling
- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Consider model size vs. latency tradeoffs

### Monitoring

- Track key metrics: latency, success rate, token usage, cost
- Set up alerts for failures and anomalies
- Use structured logging with context
- Integrate with Azure Monitor / Application Insights
- Review traces regularly for optimization opportunities

## Anti-Patterns

- **Inline prompt strings**: Embedding prompts as multi-line strings in code -> Store in `prompts/` directory as separate files
- **Unpinned model versions**: Using `gpt-4o` without date suffix -> Pin explicitly (e.g., `gpt-5.1-2026-01-15`)
- **No evaluation before deploy**: Shipping agents without running eval datasets -> Gate deployment on quality thresholds
- **Monolithic agent**: One agent handling all domains and tasks -> Split into specialized agents with clear handoffs
- **Ignoring token costs**: No monitoring of per-request token usage -> Track tokens per component and set budgets
- **Missing error recovery**: No retry or fallback on LLM failures -> Implement retries with backoff and fallback models
- **Skipping tracing setup**: Deploying without observability -> Enable OpenTelemetry tracing from day one
