# GitLab Merge Request Workflow

## Instructions

### 1. Check Current State

Always start by checking git status:

```bash
# Current branch
git branch --show-current

# Uncommitted changes
git status --short

# Existing MR for current branch
glab mr list --source-branch=$(git branch --show-current) 2>/dev/null || echo "No MR"
```

### 1b. Check for Code Review Spec

After checking git state, look for a code review spec for this branch/ticket.

Extract ticket from current branch name (pattern `EPMCDME-XXXXX`).

Try to read the spec:
```
Read: .codemie/reviews/<TICKET>/review.md
# Fallback (if no ticket found):
Read: .codemie/reviews/<branch-name>/review.md
```

If spec is found → extract for MR description:
- **Issues found**: count of `- [ ]` + `- [x]` + `- [~]` under CRITICAL and MAJOR
- **Issues fixed**: count of `- [x]` items
- **Issues rejected**: count of `- [~]` items with justifications
- **Clean**: if no issues were found at all

Keep this data — it will be injected into the MR description in Step 4.

### 2. Validate Jira Ticket (Required for Commits)

**Before any commit**, verify Jira ticket exists in context:

- Look for `EPMCDME-xxx` pattern in conversation history
- Check if user provided ticket number
- **If no ticket found**: Ask user: "What is the Jira ticket number (EPMCDME-xxx)?"

**Do NOT proceed with commit without Jira ticket.**

### 3. Handle Based on User Request

**"commit changes"** → Commit only (requires Jira ticket):
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "EPMCDME-xxx: Action and message"
```

**"push changes"** → Push only:
```bash
git push --set-upstream origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

**"create MR"** → Full workflow below.

### 4. Create MR Workflow

#### If on `main` branch:
1. Create feature branch first: `git checkout -b <type>/<description>`
2. Then proceed with commit/push/MR

#### If MR already exists:
```bash
git push --set-upstream origin $(git branch --show-current)
# Inform: "Changes pushed to existing MR: <url>"
```

#### If no MR exists:
```bash
# Push changes
git push --set-upstream origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

Build the MR title from the Jira ticket and a concise description of the work done (read commit history since main if needed to understand what was implemented):
```bash
git log main..HEAD --oneline
```

Title rules:
- Pattern: `EPMCDME-xxx: <Short description starting with capital letter>`
- Max ~70 characters
- Describe the feature/fix, not the process ("Add SharePoint datasource support", not "Implement EPMCDME-123")

Build the description — always include **Summary** and **Changes**. If a code review spec was found in Step 1b, include the **Code Review** section:

```bash
glab mr create \
  --title "EPMCDME-xxx: <Short feature description>" \
  --description "## Summary
[2-4 sentence overview of what was implemented and why]

## Changes
- [Key change 1]
- [Key change 2]

## Code Review
<!-- Include ONLY if review spec was found in Step 1b -->
AI code review completed (AI-Code-Review marker in commit history).
- Issues found: <N critical, N major> / No issues found (clean)
- Issues fixed: <N> / N/A
- Issues rejected: <N with justification> / N/A

:white_check_mark: Reviewed and approved by AI Code Reviewer

## Checklist
- [ ] Self-reviewed
- [ ] Manual testing performed
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] No breaking changes (or documented)"
```

**If no review spec was found** → omit the `## Code Review` section entirely from the description.

After MR is created, immediately approve it using the MR IID returned by `glab mr create`:
```bash
glab mr approve <MR_IID>
```

This adds the AI reviewer's +1 to the MR. If `glab mr approve` fails (e.g., self-approval not allowed on this GitLab instance), inform the user but do not treat it as a blocking error.

After the MR is created, hand off to the `babysit-mr` skill to monitor it:
- Invoke `babysit-mr` with the MR URL returned by `glab mr create`
- It will watch for CI failures, reviewer comments, and merge conflicts, fixing them autonomously until the MR merges

## Commit Format

**Enforced by Tekton CI** — invalid messages will block the pipeline.

**Regex**: `^((EPMCDME)-(?!0+)\d+:\s[A-Z][a-z]*.*|Generate release notes for version \d+\.\d+\.\d+|Revert "(EPMCDME|AMNAAIRN)-(?!0+)\d+:\s[A-Z][a-z]*.*")$`

**Required Pattern**: `EPMCDME-xxx: Capital sentence` (description must start with uppercase letter)

**Valid examples**:
```bash
git commit -m "EPMCDME-123: Add new documentation"
git commit -m "EPMCDME-456: Fix authentication bug"
git commit -m "Generate release notes for version 1.2.3"
git commit -m "Revert \"EPMCDME-123: Fix authentication bug\""
```

**Invalid** (will be rejected by Tekton):
```bash
git commit -m "Add new feature"       # Missing ticket
git commit -m "feat: add feature"     # Wrong format
git commit -m "EPMCDME-123 add feature"  # Missing colon
git commit -m "EPMCDME-123: fix bug"  # Lowercase first letter
git commit -m "EPMCDME-0: Fix bug"    # Zero ticket ID not allowed
```

## Branch Format

**Pattern**: `<type>/<description>` (Jira ticket optional)

**Examples**:
- `feat/add-user-profile`
- `fix/auth-timeout`
- `docs/api-guide`
- `feat/EPMCDME-123-user-settings` (ticket optional but allowed)

## MR Title Format

**Pattern**: `EPMCDME-xxx: Brief description`

Always start with Jira ticket number.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "glab: command not found"
**Solution**: Install GitLab CLI:
```bash
# macOS
brew install glab

# Linux
snap install glab

# Or download from: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli
```

### Error: No Jira ticket in context
**Action**: Ask user: "What is the Jira ticket number (EPMCDME-xxx) for this commit?"
- Wait for user response
- Validate format matches `EPMCDME-\d+`
- Then proceed with commit

### Error: Already on main branch
**Solution**: Create feature branch first:
```bash
git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>
```

### Error: No changes to commit
**Solution**: Check `git status` - nothing to commit or changes already staged.

### MR already exists
**Action**: Just push updates to existing MR, don't create new one.

## Examples

### Example 1: User provides ticket upfront
**User**: "commit these auth changes for EPMCDME-456"
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "EPMCDME-456: Fix OAuth2 token refresh"
```

### Example 2: No ticket in context
**User**: "commit the changes"
**Claude**: "What is the Jira ticket number (EPMCDME-xxx) for this commit?"
**User**: "EPMCDME-789"
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "EPMCDME-789: Update user profile API"
```

### Example 3: Full MR creation
**User**: "push and create MR for EPMCDME-321"
1. Check for existing MR
2. Commit with ticket: `EPMCDME-321: Add payment gateway`
3. Push changes
4. Create MR with title: `EPMCDME-321: Add payment gateway`

### Example 4: Push to existing MR
**User**: "push my changes"
1. Check MR status
2. If exists: push to existing
3. If not: push only (no MR creation unless requested)
