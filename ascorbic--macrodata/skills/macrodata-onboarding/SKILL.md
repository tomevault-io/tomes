# Onboarding Skill

Guide new users through initial macrodata setup.

## When to Use

- `get_context` returns `isFirstRun: true`
- User explicitly asks to set up or reset their profile
- State files are empty or missing


## Onboarding Flow

### Phase 1: User Info

User info has been pre-detected and is available in the context above as "Detected User Info". This JSON contains:
- `username`, `fullName`, `timezone`
- `git.name`, `git.email`
- `github.login`, `github.name`, `github.blog`, `github.bio`
- `codeDirs` - array of existing code directories

Use this data throughout onboarding - no need to run detection scripts.

### Phase 2: Location

Offer location options. Always include:
- `~/Documents/macrodata` - easy to find
- `~/.config/macrodata` - hidden, default

Only include a code directory option if `codeDirs` from the detection was non-empty.

If they choose a non-default location, write the config to `~/.config/macrodata/config.json`:

```json
{
  "root": "/chosen/path"
}
```

After writing the config, signal the daemon to reload:

```bash
kill -HUP $(cat ~/.config/macrodata/.daemon.pid) 2>/dev/null || true
```

Then create the directory structure:
- `<root>/state/`
- `<root>/journal/`
- `<root>/entities/people/`
- `<root>/entities/projects/`
- `<root>/topics/`

### Phase 3: Human Profile

Use the info from the detection script to pre-populate.

**Ask the basics:**
- What should I call you? (confirm or correct auto-detected name)
- What's your GitHub username? (if not detected from gh cli)
- Do you have a website or blog?
- Any social profiles you'd like me to know about?

**Communication style:**
If they consent, analyze their OpenCode session history (`~/.local/share/opencode/storage/`):

```bash
# Extract human messages from OpenCode session history
# Messages are stored in part/ directory, organized by message ID
# User messages have role: "user" in the parent message metadata

# Find recent user message parts
for msg_dir in $(ls -t ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message/ 2>/dev/null | head -20); do
  # Get message metadata
  cat ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/message/$msg_dir/*.json 2>/dev/null | \
    jq -r 'select(.role == "user") | .id' | while read msg_id; do
      # Get the text parts for this message
      cat ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/part/$msg_id/*.json 2>/dev/null | \
        jq -r 'select(.type == "text" and .synthetic != true) | .text' 2>/dev/null
    done
done | head -200
```

Look for patterns:
- Message length (short/direct vs detailed)
- Tone (casual, formal, technical)
- How they give feedback (direct corrections, suggestions, questions)
- Language preferences (spelling variants, idioms)

**Current work context:**
Analyze recent session history to understand what they're working on:

```bash
# Get recent project directories from OpenCode session storage
ls -t ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/session/ 2>/dev/null | head -10 | while read proj_dir; do
  cat ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/session/$proj_dir/*.json 2>/dev/null | \
    jq -r '.directory, .title' 2>/dev/null
done

# Sample recent conversations for context (last 7 days)
find ~/.local/share/opencode/storage/part -name "*.json" -mtime -7 -exec cat {} \; 2>/dev/null | \
  jq -r 'select(.type == "text" and .synthetic != true) | .text' 2>/dev/null | \
  head -100
```

**Working patterns:**
- Ask about current focus areas (or confirm what you detected)
- Any preferences for how the agent should work?

Write findings to `state/human.md`:

```markdown
# Human Profile

## Basics
- **Name:** [name]
- **GitHub:** [username]
- **Website:** [url if provided]
- **Socials:** [any provided]
- **Timezone:** [detected]

## Communication Style
- [observed patterns from analysis]
- [stated preferences]

## Working Patterns
- [current focus areas]
- [preferences]

## Current Projects
- [detected from recent sessions]

## Pending Items
- [empty initially]
```

### Phase 4: Agent Identity

Help define who the agent should be:

**Name and persona:**
- What should the agent be called?
- What's its role? (assistant, partner, specialist)
- Any personality traits?

**Values and patterns:**
- What behaviors should it prioritize?
- How proactive should it be?

Write to `state/identity.md`:

```markdown
# [Agent Name] Identity

## Persona
[Description of who the agent is, its role, personality]

## Values
- [core value 1]
- [core value 2]

## Patterns
- [behavioral pattern 1]
- [behavioral pattern 2]
```

### Phase 5: Initial Workspace

Set up working context:

1. Ask what they're currently working on
2. Create initial project files in `entities/projects/`
3. Write `state/today.md` with current context
4. Write `state/workspace.md` with active projects

```markdown
# Today

## Now
[Current context from conversation]

## Context
[Background information]
```

```markdown
# Workspace

## Active Projects
- [project 1] - [brief description]

## Open Threads
- [things in progress]
```

### Phase 6: Permissions

Ask if they'd like to pre-grant permissions for macrodata paths. This avoids permission prompts every session.

**Ask:** "Would you like me to update your OpenCode settings to pre-grant permissions for macrodata? This means you won't be prompted each time macrodata reads or writes to its memory folder."

If yes, update `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` to add these permissions:

```json
{
  "permission": {
    "external_directory": {
      "<macrodata-root>/**": "allow"
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** Replace `<macrodata-root>` with their actual chosen root path (e.g., `~/Documents/macrodata`).

Merge with existing settings rather than overwriting. Read the file, add the new permissions to the existing `permission` object, and write back.

### Phase 7: Scheduled Reminders

**First, check available integrations:**

Look at the tools and plugins available in your current context. Note any that might be useful for scheduled tasks - for example:
- Calendar integrations → could check meetings in morning prep
- Email/messaging tools → could summarize communications
- Task managers → could review todos
- Project management tools → could check status

Don't hardcode specific tool names - just note what categories are available. Mention relevant ones when describing the schedule options below.

**Then offer scheduled reminders:**

Offer optional scheduled reminders. These run in the background with no user interaction.

**Options to offer:**

1. **Morning prep** (daily, 9am) - Quick review to set the day's focus. Updates today.md.

2. **Memory maintenance** (daily, 6pm) - End of day cleanup. Reviews journals, updates state files, prunes stale info. Runs the `macrodata-memory-maintenance` skill.

3. **Dreamtime** (daily, 2am) - Deep nightly reflection. Self-improvement, research, pattern recognition. Runs the `macrodata-dreamtime` skill.

For each selected reminder, use the `schedule` tool to create it. **Important:** For deep thinking tasks (dreamtime, memory maintenance), specify a capable model using the `model` parameter. Choose a model appropriate for reflection and reasoning - the user's most capable available model is best for these tasks.

```
Morning prep:
- id: morning-prep
- type: cron
- expression: 0 9 * * *
- description: Morning prep - update today.md
- payload: Review today.md. What's the focus for today? Any carryover from yesterday? Check if any calendar, email, or task tools are available and use them to see what's planned. Keep it brief.
- model: (optional - default is fine for quick tasks)

Memory maintenance:
- id: macrodata-memory-maintenance
- type: cron
- expression: 0 18 * * *
- description: End of day memory maintenance
- payload: Run the macrodata-memory-maintenance skill.
- model: (use a capable model for reflection tasks)

Dreamtime:
- id: macrodata-dreamtime
- type: cron
- expression: 0 2 * * *
- description: Nightly reflection and self-improvement
- payload: Run the macrodata-dreamtime skill.
- model: (use the most capable available model for deep thinking)
```

### Phase 8: Finalize

1. Rebuild the memory index with `manage_index`
2. Log completion to journal
3. Summarize what was created
4. Suggest next steps

## Session History Analysis

If the user consents, analyze their OpenCode history for context:

**Context to extract:**
- Recent project directories they've been working in
- Common file types and technologies
- Recurring themes or topics

## Example Conversation

**Agent:** Welcome to macrodata! Let's get you set up.

First, where would you like me to store your memory files?
1. `~/Documents/macrodata` (easy to find in Finder)
2. `~/.config/macrodata` (hidden, default)

_[If a code directory like ~/Code or ~/Projects exists, also offer that as an option]_

**User:** Documents is fine

**Agent:** Got it. Now, what should I call you?

**User:** Matt

**Agent:** I can see from your system that you're [name from git config], GitHub username [from gh cli], and you're in the [timezone] timezone. Is that right?

**User:** Yeah

**Agent:** Do you have a website or any social profiles you'd like me to know about?

**User:** My blog is example.com

**Agent:** Got it. Would you like me to analyze your OpenCode session history to understand your communication style and what you've been working on? I'll look at things like how you communicate and recent projects. This stays completely local.

**User:** Sure

**Agent:** [runs analysis, summarizes findings]

Looking at your history, I can see you communicate in short, direct messages, give quick acknowledgments, and tend to ask questions before committing to an approach. You've been working on [detected projects] recently.

Now, what would you like to call your agent?
