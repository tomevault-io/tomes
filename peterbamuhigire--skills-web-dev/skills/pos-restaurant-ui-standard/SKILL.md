## Required Plugins

**Superpowers plugin:** MUST be active for all work using this skill. Use throughout the entire build pipeline — design decisions, code generation, debugging, quality checks, and any task where it offers enhanced capabilities. If superpowers provides a better way to accomplish something, prefer it over the default approach.

**Frontend Design plugin (`webapp-gui-design`):** MUST be active for all visual output from this skill. Use for design system work, component styling, layout decisions, colour selection, typography, responsive design, and visual QA.
