## Required Plugins

**Superpowers plugin:** MUST be active for all work using this skill. Use throughout the entire build pipeline — design decisions, code generation, debugging, quality checks, and any task where it offers enhanced capabilities. If superpowers provides a better way to accomplish something, prefer it over the default approach.

# Google Play Store Review Readiness

## Overview

Use this skill to ensure Android apps meet Google Play policy and technical requirements before first submission or major updates. Focus on avoiding automated policy flags and making human review fast.

## Quick Reference

- Policy compliance: restricted content, UGC moderation, deceptive UX
- Data Safety: SDK inventory matches form, privacy policy live and accurate
- Permissions: request at point of use, justify sensitive access, no unused permissions
- SDK and tech hygiene: targetSdk current, background work compliant
- Ads and IAP: clear labeling, close controls, pricing and restore flows
- Store listing: screenshots and claims match app
- Reviewer notes: provide test account and step-by-step paths

## Core Instructions

1. Inventory app features and risk areas (ads, UGC, payments, location, kids). Use that to drive policy checks.
2. Audit data collection and sharing for every SDK and permission. Ensure the Data Safety form matches reality.
3. Validate permissions: only declared when used, request at point of use with in-app rationale.
4. Confirm targetSdk and compileSdk and background behavior meet current Play requirements.
5. Verify store listing accuracy: screenshots, video, and descriptions map to real UI and features.
6. Validate monetization: subscriptions, trials, and IAP flows are transparent and functional.
7. Run install and upgrade tests across supported devices and OS versions.
8. Provide detailed Review Notes to guide the reviewer through sensitive flows.

## Key Patterns

### Truthful disclosure

- Keep the Data Safety form, permissions, and privacy policy aligned.
- Treat every SDK as data collection unless proven otherwise.

### Permission gating

- Show a clear in-app rationale before system dialogs.
- Request sensitive permissions only at point of use.
- Provide a fallback if permission is denied.

### Reviewer-friendly submission

- Include a test account, steps to reach sensitive features, and expected results.
- Call out any delays or required setup.

## Common Pitfalls

- Declaring "no data collected" while using analytics or crash reporting.
- Requesting permissions that are not used or not justified in the UI.
- Ads that auto-redirect or hide close buttons.
- Store listing screenshots that show non-existent features.
- Missing or inaccessible privacy policy URL.

## Examples

### Review notes template

```markdown
## Test Account
Email: reviewer@example.com
Password: Test1234

## Sensitive Features
1. Location permission: Used for store locator only.
	- Path: Home -> Find Stores
	- If denied, allow manual zip code entry.

## Special Instructions
- First launch may take ~10 seconds to sync catalog.
- Premium features are marked with a star icon.
