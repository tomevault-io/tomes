# Verify

## Overview

Before handing work off (see [commits-and-prs.md](../commits-and-prs/SKILL.md)), verify against a local PocketBase and the local SvelteKit app. Canutin has no preview-deployment system; all verification is local.

## Local Servers

Manual checks run against `bun run dev` plus a local PocketBase. Playwright brings up its own preview server as part of `bun run test` - never start one by hand. Ownership rules, ports, and start commands: see [local-servers](../local-servers/SKILL.md).

## Quality Check

```bash
bun run quality
```

This runs Prettier, ESLint, and svelte-check. Resolve all errors before committing. On a fresh worktree, run `bunx @inlang/paraglide-js compile --project ./project.inlang --outdir ./src/lib/paraglide` once if svelte-check can't find `$lib/paraglide/messages` — the Vite plugin normally generates this during dev/build.

## Running Tests

```bash
bun run test --project=desktop -- e2e/your-test.test.ts
bun run test --project=mobile  -- e2e/your-test.test.ts
```

Both projects are required before pushing. See [testing.md](../testing/SKILL.md) for conventions.

## QA Bootstrap

When the user wants to manually QA a feature in the browser, seed a basic user first:

```bash
bun -e "import('./e2e/pocketbase.helpers').then(m => m.seedUser('alice').then(u => console.log(u.email)))"
```

Use the printed email with `DEFAULT_PASSWORD` (`123qweasdzxc`) to log in.

## Reset When Needed

```bash
bun run pb:reset
```

Wipes the PocketBase dev database. The superuser (`superadmin@example.com` / `123qweasdzxc`) is re-upserted automatically on the next `bun run pb` start.
