description: Drive an open-source EDA workflow from RTL to GDS with signoff checks (DRC, LVS, RCX) using OpenROAD-flow-scripts (ORFS), Yosys, KLayout, and OpenRCX. Use when the user wants to turn a hardware spec or RTL into synthesis results, place-and-route, GDS output, signoff verification, parasitic extraction, or report summaries. Also use when iterating on PPA, diagnosing flow failures, or viewing a multi-project dashboard. Use when this capability is needed.

# r2g-rtl2gds Skill

Execute a staged, artifact-first open-source EDA flow from specification to GDSII with full signoff checks using OpenROAD-flow-scripts (ORFS). Prefer deterministic scripts for execution, keeping the agent focused on planning, generation, diagnosis, and iteration.

## Environment Setup

Every flow script sources `scripts/flow/_env.sh` on entry, which autodetects
ORFS + tool paths and lets the user override any single value. You do not
need to source anything manually.

### Resolution order (first hit wins, per value)

1. **Variable already set in the caller's environment** — `ORFS_ROOT=... run_orfs.sh ...` wins unconditionally.
2. **User env file** — path in `$R2G_ENV_FILE` (if set).
3. **In-skill override file** — `references/env.local.sh` (copy from `references/env.local.sh.template`).
4. **ORFS-provided env** — `$ORFS_ROOT/env.sh` (once `ORFS_ROOT` is known).
5. **System-wide env** — `/opt/openroad_tools_env.sh` (if present).
6. **Autodetect** — `command -v <tool>` on `$PATH`, then a list of well-known install paths (e.g. `$ORFS_ROOT/tools/install/OpenROAD/bin/openroad`, `$HOME/oss-cad-suite/bin/yosys`, `/usr/local/bin/klayout`).

### Checking what the skill found

```bash
bash scripts/flow/check_env.sh
```

Prints the resolved `ORFS_ROOT`, every tool binary it picked, and the
platforms it can see. Exits non-zero if a required tool is missing.

### Overriding just a few values

```bash
# One-off override for a single run
ORFS_ROOT=/opt/ORFS OPENROAD_EXE=/opt/openroad/bin/openroad \
  bash scripts/flow/run_orfs.sh design_cases/my_design nangate45

# Or persist overrides in a file
cp references/env.local.sh.template references/env.local.sh
# ...then edit the exports you care about; every subsequent flow picks them up.
```

### Available platforms

`nangate45`, `sky130hd`, `sky130hs`, `asap7`, `gf180`, `ihp-sg13g2` (default: `nangate45`).

## Workflow

### 1. Normalize the Specification First

- Convert free-form requirements into a structured specification before writing RTL.
- Read `references/spec-template.md` and produce `input/normalized-spec.yaml`.
- If clock/reset, IO, target flow, or timing targets are missing, stop and ask the user or record explicit assumptions.

### 2. Initialize a Project Directory

- Create a run folder under `design_cases/<design-name>/` using `scripts/project/init_project.py`.
- The layout follows `references/workflow.md`.
- Directories created: `input/`, `rtl/`, `tb/`, `constraints/`, `lint/`, `sim/`, `synth/`, `backend/`, `drc/`, `lvs/`, `rcx/`, `reports/`.

### 3. Generate RTL and Testbench Separately

- Write RTL to `rtl/design.v`.
- Write testbench to `tb/testbench.v`.
- Keep assumptions and design notes in `reports/rtl-notes.md`.

### 4. Run Validation in Strict Order

1. Run `scripts/project/validate_config.py <project-dir>` before ORFS backend to catch config/RTL issues early.
2. Run lint/syntax checks before simulation.
3. Run simulation before synthesis.
4. Run synthesis before backend (ORFS).
5. Do not skip failed stages unless the user explicitly requests it.

### 5. Run Backend with ORFS

- Prepare `constraints/config.mk` and `constraints/constraint.sdc`.
- Use `scripts/flow/run_orfs.sh` to invoke the ORFS Makefile.
- ORFS runs place-and-route natively (no Docker required).
- Collect results from the ORFS results directory.

### 5b. Check Timing Before Signoff (Tiered WNS + TNS)

After ORFS completes, extract PPA and run the timing gate:

1. Run `scripts/extract/extract_ppa.py <project-dir> reports/ppa.json` to extract timing metrics.
2. Run `scripts/reports/check_timing.py <project-dir>` to classify WNS and TNS and write `reports/timing_check.json`.
3. The script independently classifies WNS and TNS, then takes the **worse** of the two as the combined tier. A design with small WNS but large TNS (many slightly-violating paths) is caught.
4. Read `reports/timing_check.json` and act on the `tier`:

| Tier | Criteria | Agent Action |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **clean** | WNS >= 0, TNS >= 0 | Proceed to signoff. |
| **minor** | WNS >= -2.0 AND TNS >= -10.0 | Auto-fix: update `clk_period` in constraint.sdc to `suggested_clock_period` from the JSON, then re-run backend. Report the fix to the user after the fact. |
| **moderate** | WNS >= -5.0 AND TNS >= -100.0 (but not clean/minor) | **Stop.** Present the numbered `options` from the JSON to the user. Wait for their choice. |
| **severe** | WNS < -5.0 OR TNS < -100.0 | **Stop.** Present options with strong warning. |
| **unconstrained** | WNS > 1e+30 | **Stop.** SDC clock port mismatch. Present options. Do NOT proceed. |

5. The JSON includes `wns_tier` and `tns_tier` fields so the agent can explain which metric triggered the tier (e.g., "TNS escalated this from minor to moderate").
6. Only proceed to signoff checks (step 6) after timing is resolved.

### 5a. (Optional) Fmax search — find the fastest closing period

Before committing to a clock period, you can characterize the design's Fmax:

    python3 scripts/reports/fmax_search.py <project-dir> [platform] [--verify]

Loose-first search using cheap **placement-stage** timing (each probe runs only
`ORFS_STAGES="synth floorplan place"`). It reports a **predicted-signoff Fmax**
(`reports/fmax_search.json`), corrected by a learned per-family slack-deterioration
model. The number is a **proxy (UNVERIFIED)** — post-place timing is optimistic vs
signoff. Pass `--verify` to confirm the winner with one full flow (and feed the
result back to tighten the model). This does NOT replace the step-8 `check_timing`
gate, which still runs on the final backend.

Knobs: `--probe-timeout`, `--place-fast` (whole-search conservative lower bound
for hang-prone designs), `--keep-variants`. The search is sequential; cross-design
parallelism is achieved by running multiple invocations concurrently.

### 6. Run Signoff Checks (DRC, LVS, RCX)

After a successful backend run, run signoff checks in order:

#### DRC (Design Rule Check)

Two tool options are available:

1. **KLayout DRC** (default) — `scripts/flow/run_drc.sh <project-dir> [platform]`
   - Uses ORFS `make drc` target with platform `.lydrc` rules
   - Outputs: `drc/6_drc.lyrdb`, `drc/6_drc_count.rpt`, `drc/6_drc.log`

2. **Magic DRC** (sky130 only) — `scripts/flow/run_magic_drc.sh <project-dir> [platform]`
   - Uses Magic's built-in DRC engine with sky130A tech file
   - Requires the sky130A PDK; the script reads `$PDK_ROOT/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech`
     (set `PDK_ROOT` via `references/env.local.sh` — `/opt/pdks` is only the fallback default).
   - Outputs: `drc/magic_drc.rpt`, `drc/magic_drc_count.rpt`, `drc/magic_drc_result.json`
   - Supported platforms: sky130hd, sky130hs

#### LVS (Layout vs Schematic)

Two tool options are available:

1. **KLayout LVS** (default) — `scripts/flow/run_lvs.sh <project-dir> [platform]`
   - Uses ORFS `make lvs` target with platform `.lylvs` rules + CDL netlist
   - **Gracefully skips** platforms without LVS rules (produces `lvs/lvs_result.json` with status "skipped")
   - Outputs: `lvs/6_lvs.lvsdb`, `lvs/6_lvs.log`, `lvs/6_final.cdl`
   - nangate45: uses adapted FreePDK45 rules with `connect_implicit("VDD"/"VSS")` for bulk merging and `schematic.purge` for unused cell pins (e.g., QN on DFFR_X1)
   - **Large design warning**: KLayout LVS on designs >100K cells (black_parrot, swerv) takes >60 minutes. Use `LVS_TIMEOUT=7200` for these designs. The default 3600s may not be enough.

2. **Netgen LVS** (sky130 only) — `scripts/flow/run_netgen_lvs.sh <project-dir> [platform]`
   - Two-step flow: Magic extracts SPICE from GDS, then Netgen compares against Verilog netlist
   - Requires the sky130A PDK (Magic tech + `$PDK_ROOT/sky130A/libs.tech/netgen/sky130A_setup.tcl`).
     Set `PDK_ROOT` via `references/env.local.sh`; `/opt/pdks` is only the fallback default.
   - Outputs: `lvs/extracted.spice`, `lvs/netgen_lvs.rpt`, `lvs/netgen_lvs_result.json`
   - Supported platforms: sky130hd, sky130hs
   - **This is the production sky130 LVS path** — prefer it over KLayout LVS on sky130 (the
     ORFS KLayout sky130 rule deck is not production-grade; see `references/failure-patterns.md`,
     "sky130 LVS").
   - Antenna-diode designs are handled automatically: the script normalizes Magic's diode
     `X`-subcircuit instances to `D` devices (`perim=`→`pj=`) and runs netgen with
     `MAGIC_EXT_USE_GDS=1`, so `sky130_fd_sc_hd__diode_2` matches instead of flattening.
   - Designs with port-to-port feedthroughs (`assign out_port = in_port`) need
     `export POST_GLOBAL_PLACE_TCL = <skill>/scripts/flow/orfs_hooks/buffer_port_feedthroughs.tcl`
     in config.mk **before the backend run** — SPICE cannot express two top-level ports on one
     net, so without the hook LVS fails "Top level cell failed pin matching". The hook is a
     no-op for designs without feedthroughs (safe to set everywhere); a backend re-run is
     required when adding it. See `references/failure-patterns.md`, "sky130 LVS" cause 5.

#### RCX (Parasitic Extraction)

3. **RCX** — `scripts/flow/run_rcx.sh <project-dir> [platform]`
   - OpenRCX parasitic extraction via OpenROAD
   - Generates Tcl script (`rcx/run_rcx.tcl`) with `define_process_corner`, `extract_parasitics`, `write_spef`
   - Reads `6_final.odb` from ORFS results, writes SPEF output
   - Outputs: `rcx/6_final.spef`, `rcx/rcx.log`, `rcx/run_rcx.tcl`

Extract results into JSON for reporting and dashboard:
- `scripts/extract/extract_drc.py <project-root> reports/drc.json`
- `scripts/extract/extract_lvs.py <project-root> reports/lvs.json`
- `scripts/extract/extract_rcx.py <project-root> reports/rcx.json`
- If DRC/LVS is `fail`, attempt automated real-layout fixes:
  `scripts/flow/fix_signoff.sh <project-dir> [platform] [--check drc|lvs|both]`
  (See `references/signoff-fixing.md`.)
- If the **backend aborted at `route`** (congestion / DRT timeout, exit 124 — `orfs_status=fail`,
  `orfs_fail_stage=route`), relieve it BEFORE signoff:
  `scripts/flow/fix_signoff.sh <project-dir> sky130hd --check route` (lowers `CORE_UTILIZATION` so
  DRT converges; learnable + A/B-validated `route_relief`). See `references/failure-patterns.md`
  "Routing Congestion".

#### Fix-Learning Loop

The skill learns from every fix attempt so candidate strategies are proposed in
evidence-ranked order on the next similar violation.

- **Record.** `fix_signoff.sh` and `check_timing.py --journal` append lossless,
  session-keyed rows to `reports/fix_log.jsonl` (one per iteration: strategy, before/after
  counts, pre-fix violation class, verdict). `fix_signoff.sh` uses an adaptive budget (base
  3 iters, hard cap 8, early-stop after 2 non-improving iters past the base).
- **Ingest.** Step-10 ingest (`knowledge/ingest_run.py`) reads `fix_log.jsonl` into the
  Tier-1 `fix_events` table and writes a `run_violations` snapshot for **every** run — clean
  or not (the full violation landscape). It then auto-runs `fix_log_manager.manage()`
  (toggle `R2G_FIX_AUTOLEARN`, default on).
- **Learn.** `learn_heuristics.py` derives Tier-2 `fix_trajectories` (per-episode path,
  including *abandoned* episodes and failed strategies — negative learning) and folds them
  into Tier-3 `fix_recipes` inside `heuristics.json`.
- **Apply.** When a recipe exists for the design's family/platform/violation class,
  `diagnose_signoff_fix.py` reorders the strategy list by empirical clearance — there is **no
  hard gate**, all real-fix strategies are always proposed, priority-ordered.
  `diagnose_signoff_fix.py <proj> --check drc --list` prints the evidence-ranked candidate
  set as JSON. Hard safety clamps are unchanged.
- **Symptom index.** Learned repair experience is keyed by a **symptom signature**
  (`knowledge/symptom.py`: `{check, class, predicates}` → a stable `symptom_id`), NOT the
  design-family name. `learn_heuristics.py` emits a top-level `symptoms[symptom_id]`
  projection in `heuristics.json` (pooled across families/platforms, with `by_platform` +
  `evidence_designs` provenance); `diagnose_signoff_fix.py` looks recipes up by symptom and
  seeds an informed cross-platform prior for untried strategies (so a fix learned on
  nangate45 transfers to e.g. sky130hd). It also surfaces the matching active prose lesson
  (via `search_failures.lessons_for_symptom`) at the fix-decision point. `monitor_health.py`
  (degradation alerts) and `analyze_execution.py` (fix-proposal triage) are operator-invoked
  CLIs over the same store.

See `references/signoff-fixing.md` ("Fix-Learning Loop") and `knowledge/README.md`.

#### Engineer Loop (campaign mode)

Use campaign mode when you need to run the full flow unattended across many designs — or
when you want the A/B-gated recipe-learning cycle to run autonomously. The campaign
orchestrator (`scripts/loop/engineer_loop.py`) drives the flow scripts, ingests results,
triggers learning, and manages A/B trials without human gates.

```bash
# Add a project to the campaign ledger
python3 scripts/loop/engineer_loop.py add \
    --ledger design_cases/_batch/campaign.jsonl \
    --project design_cases/my_design [--platform nangate45]

# Run the campaign (optionally limit to N designs)
python3 scripts/loop/engineer_loop.py run \
    --ledger design_cases/_batch/campaign.jsonl [--max N]

# Inspect per-design state
python3 scripts/loop/engineer_loop.py status \
    --ledger design_cases/_batch/campaign.jsonl
```

The ledger is JSONL (last-state-wins); kill/restart is safe — the campaign resumes where it
left off. States: `pending → flow → signoff → fixing → clean | escalated | abandoned`.

**Hard rules for campaign mode:**
- Phase-1 runs workers=1 (single-process); do not run two campaigns sharing a `DESIGN_NAME`
  concurrently.
- Never run two configs with the same `DESIGN_NAME` + `FLOW_VARIANT` concurrently.
- Never run more than one LVS job concurrently for designs > 100 K cells.
- Only `promoted` recipes affect live strategy ranking; shadow and candidate recipes are
  inert until their A/B trial completes.

When the loop opens an escalation (unknown symptom, exhausted catalog, unseen crash, or
repeated regression), drain it following the agent runbook in
`references/engineer-loop.md` ("Escalation Drain"). That document also covers provenance
queries (`trace_provenance.py`) and the full safety-invariant list.

#### Platform Support Matrix

| Platform | KLayout DRC | KLayout LVS | Magic DRC | Netgen LVS | RCX |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|------------|-----|
| nangate45 | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| sky130hd | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| sky130hs | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| asap7 | Yes | No | No | No | Yes |
| gf180 | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| ihp-sg13g2 | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |

### 7. Treat Artifacts as Source of Truth

- Save logs, reports, VCD waveforms, netlists, SPEF, configurations, and summary files.
- Prefer file outputs over GUI tools. GUI viewers like GTKWave/KLayout are optional helpers.

### 8. Diagnose Before Editing

- For failures, read `references/failure-patterns.md`.
- Classify the failure: specification gap, RTL bug, testbench bug, synthesis issue, backend/configuration issue, DRC violation, LVS mismatch, or RCX extraction error.
- Fix the smallest plausible cause first.

### 9. Summarize Each Stage Clearly

- State pass/fail status.
- List key artifact paths.
- Record assumptions, blockers, and next recommended actions.
- For signoff: report DRC violation count, LVS match/skip status, RCX net count and total capacitance.

### 10. Ingest the Run into the Knowledge Store

After **every** flow — successful, failed, or partial — run:

```bash
python3 r2g-rtl2gds/knowledge/ingest_run.py design_cases/<project>
```

This reads the structured JSON artifacts produced by the extraction scripts
and appends one row to `r2g-rtl2gds/knowledge/knowledge.sqlite`. It never
parses raw ORFS logs.

Then rebuild derived artifacts:

```bash
python3 r2g-rtl2gds/knowledge/learn_heuristics.py
python3 r2g-rtl2gds/knowledge/mine_rules.py
```

- `knowledge/heuristics.json` is consumed automatically by
  `suggest_config.py` on the next project — no CLI changes required.
- `knowledge/failure_candidates.json` is a **review queue**, not a rule
  source. Surface new signatures to the user and, if confirmed, edit
  `references/failure-patterns.md` by hand.

A family/platform pair appears in `heuristics.json` only after at least
**3 successful runs** under that configuration.

### 10b. Share / Transfer the Knowledge Store Across Users (git-friendly)

`knowledge.sqlite` is the **tracked, committed store** — a fresh clone is pre-trained
immediately. A binary SQLite blob cannot be combined across operators (git only
3-way-merges text; two operators' campaigns would conflict and one would clobber the
other), so when you need to **share or merge** experience across operators,
`knowledge/knowledge_sync.py` is an **on-demand** tool: it exports a deterministic,
git-friendly text bundle (`knowledge/store/`, one NDJSON file per table — regenerable,
not committed by default) and performs a real honesty-gated cross-operator union:

```bash
# After learning, re-export the committed text bundle (keeps it in sync with the DB):
python3 knowledge/knowledge_sync.py export

# A NEW user folds another operator's experience into their local store. The merge is
# ADDITIVE (dedups by natural content key — run_id/symptom_id are portable; surrogate
# ids are re-assigned) and is REFUSED+rolled back if it would break an honesty gate:
python3 knowledge/knowledge_sync.py merge --bundle path/to/their/store
python3 knowledge/knowledge_sync.py merge --from-db path/to/their/knowledge.sqlite

# Bootstrap a fresh store from a bundle only (rebuilds knowledge.sqlite):
python3 knowledge/knowledge_sync.py import --bundle knowledge/store --db knowledge/knowledge.sqlite

# Honesty CI gate (the real gate — runs the 5 honesty gates over the committed store):
python3 knowledge/honesty.py --db knowledge/knowledge.sqlite
# On-demand drift check for an EXPORTED bundle you intend to share (reports
# "no committed bundle" by design when none exists — NOT a CI gate post-revert):
python3 knowledge/knowledge_sync.py status
```

**Commit workflow:** `knowledge.sqlite` is the committed store — commit it (and
`heuristics.json`) after ingest/learn, as before. The `knowledge/store/` bundle is gitignored
and only produced on demand (`export`) when you want to hand experience to another operator or
review a diff; `status` confirms an exported bundle matches the DB. After any `merge`, run
`learn()` + `engineer_loop ab-drain` so imported recipes re-validate locally. See
`knowledge/README.md` ("Sharing the store across users").

## Hard Rules

- Do not start backend if simulation is failing.
- Do not start ORFS if synthesis failed or the top module is unclear.
- Do not start signoff checks (DRC/LVS/RCX) if backend did not produce a GDS/ODB.
- Run `check_timing.py` after every backend run. It checks both WNS and TNS. For minor violations (WNS >= -2.0 AND TNS >= -10.0), auto-fix by increasing clock period and re-running. For moderate/severe/unconstrained, stop and present numbered fix options — do not proceed without the user's decision.
- Do not silently invent missing interfaces, clocks, resets, or timing targets without documenting assumptions.
- Prefer single-clock MVP flows. Macro designs (fakeram45) are supported with proper config (see "Macro / Hard Memory Designs"). Escalate to the user before attempting CDC, multi-clock, or DFT.
- Use the scripts in `scripts/` for repeatable operations instead of re-inventing shell commands each time.
- Do not hand-source any system env file before running EDA tools — every flow script sources `scripts/flow/_env.sh`, which autodetects ORFS and tool paths (see "Environment Setup"). `/opt/openroad_tools_env.sh` is only one optional source in that chain and may be absent.
- When a batch produces a mix of pass/fail, diagnose with `references/failure-patterns.md` (see "Batch-Campaign Failure Patterns") and apply the repo-level batch fixer before any code changes. That fixer (`tools/fix_orfs_failures.py` in the agent-r2g repository — not shipped with the installed skill) handles the six dominant failure modes (memory inference, IO-pin perimeter overflow, place density >1, PDN straps, missing include dirs, stage timeouts) by rewriting `config.mk`. When running standalone, apply the same patterns by hand using `references/failure-patterns.md`. Do not hand-edit configs case-by-case in batch — extend the fix tool so future batches self-heal.
- Floorplan sizing policy (validated on 495-design batch):
  - Explicit DIE_AREA is only safe when pin count ≤ ~200 *and* RTL fits in the area. Prefer `CORE_UTILIZATION` when in doubt.
  - When PPL-0024 reports a required perimeter, derive `DIE_AREA = 0 0 S S` with `S = ceil((required_perim / 4) * 1.3)` rounded up to 10um.
  - For designs with memory inference, set `SYNTH_MEMORY_MAX_BITS = 131072` (default 4096 is too tight for register files and FIFOs).

- Read `references/feature-extraction.md` when building the graph-feature (X) side of the dataset (per-node/per-edge/metadata CSVs + stats).
- Read `scripts/extract/techlib/` for the shared per-platform tech layer consumed by both stages: `profile.py` (supply voltage, tap patterns, cell-type strategy per ORFS platform), `resolve.py` (the Python backend for `resolve_platform_paths.sh` — same `KEY=VALUE` contract), `def_parse.py` (single DEF/SDC parser), `lef.py` (routing-layer names, pitch/direction, regex matcher), `liberty.py` (cell/pin/net classifiers), `cell_types.py` (`cell_type_id` map — curated for nangate45, runtime-built for all others).
- Use scripts in `scripts/` for initialization, spec normalization, environment checks, lint, simulation, synthesis, ORFS backend, DRC, LVS, RCX extraction, result collection, GDS preview rendering, dashboard generation, and run summaries.
- Use `scripts/flow/orfs_hooks/` for Tcl sourced into ORFS stages via the generic
  `PRE_<STAGE>_TCL` / `POST_<STAGE>_TCL` env hooks (set them in config.mk, not the shell —
  ORFS scrubs exported variables). Currently: `buffer_port_feedthroughs.tcl`
  (`POST_GLOBAL_PLACE_TCL`) splits port-to-port feedthrough nets behind real buffers so
  Netgen LVS top-level pins match; a no-op for designs without feedthroughs.
- Use `assets/examples/simple-arbiter/` as the first smoke-test case.
- Use `assets/config-template.mk` and `assets/constraint-template.sdc` as default backend configuration templates.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**Required Tools (all installed on this machine):**
- `python3` (3.13+)
- `yosys` (synthesis)
- `iverilog` + `vvp` (simulation)
- `openroad` (place & route, OpenRCX)

**Optional Tools (also available):**
- `verilator` (faster lint/simulation)
- `klayout` (GDS visualization, DRC, LVS)
- `magic` (DRC, SPICE extraction for sky130)
- `netgen-lvs` (LVS comparison for sky130)
- `gtkwave` (waveform viewing)
- `sta` / `opensta` (static timing analysis)

### Running a Full Flow

1. No manual env setup needed — flow scripts autodetect ORFS/tools via `scripts/flow/_env.sh`. Run `scripts/flow/check_env.sh` to confirm what was found.
2. Initialize a run directory with `scripts/project/init_project.py <design-name>`.
3. Save user requirements to `input/raw-spec.md`.
4. Normalize them into `input/normalized-spec.yaml` using `scripts/project/normalize_spec.py`.
5. Write or copy `rtl/design.v` and `tb/testbench.v`.
6. Run `scripts/flow/check_env.sh` to verify tool availability.
7. Run `scripts/flow/run_lint.sh`, then `scripts/flow/run_sim.sh`, then `scripts/flow/run_synth.sh`.
8. After those pass, prepare `constraints/config.mk` and `constraints/constraint.sdc`.
9. Run `scripts/flow/run_orfs.sh <project-dir>` for the backend.
10. Extract PPA: `scripts/extract/extract_ppa.py <project-dir> reports/ppa.json`
11. Run timing gate: `scripts/reports/check_timing.py <project-dir>` — reads `reports/timing_check.json`:
    - `tier=clean`: proceed to step 12.
    - `tier=minor`: auto-fix clock period per `suggested_clock_period`, re-run step 9, then re-check.
    - `tier=moderate/severe/unconstrained`: **stop, present options to user, wait for decision**.
    - Check `wns_tier` and `tns_tier` to explain which metric drove the tier.
12. Run signoff checks (only after timing gate passes or user approves):
    - `scripts/flow/run_drc.sh <project-dir> [platform]` (KLayout DRC)
    - `scripts/flow/run_magic_drc.sh <project-dir> [platform]` (Magic DRC, sky130 only)
    - `scripts/flow/run_lvs.sh <project-dir> [platform]` (KLayout LVS)
    - `scripts/flow/run_netgen_lvs.sh <project-dir> [platform]` (Netgen LVS, sky130 only)
    - `scripts/flow/run_rcx.sh <project-dir> [platform]`
13. Extract remaining results:
    - `scripts/extract/extract_drc.py <project-root> reports/drc.json`
    - `scripts/extract/extract_lvs.py <project-root> reports/lvs.json`
    - `scripts/extract/extract_rcx.py <project-root> reports/rcx.json`
    - If DRC/LVS status is `fail`, attempt real layout fixes (antenna diode insertion +
      repair iters, route effort, density relief; LVS triage):
      `scripts/flow/fix_signoff.sh <project-dir> [platform] [--check drc|lvs|both] [--max-iters 3]`
      Real-fixes-only — never relaxes the rule deck. Residual stuck/timeout/KLayout-crash
      cases are reported honestly. See `references/signoff-fixing.md`.
13b. Extract dataset labels (optional, for dataset building):
    - `scripts/flow/run_labels.sh <project-dir> [platform]`
    - Emits per-cell/per-net label CSVs to `<project-dir>/labels/` (congestion,
      wirelength, timing, IR drop) and a per-design `reports/labels_stats.json`.
    - Fail-soft: a missing input or per-label tool error is recorded, not fatal.
    - Platform-agnostic: liberty/lef/supply-voltage are resolved from the ORFS
      platform config. See `references/label-extraction.md`.
    - Batch backfill across completed designs: `tools/run_labels_batch.sh`.
13c. Extract dataset features (optional, for dataset building — the X side of 13b's Y):
    - `scripts/flow/run_features.sh <project-dir> [platform]`
    - Emits graph-feature CSVs to `<project-dir>/features/`: `metadata.csv` (graph-level),
      `nodes_{gate,net,iopin,pin}.csv`, `edges_{gate_pin,pin_net,iopin_net}.csv`, plus a
      per-design `reports/features_stats.json`.
    - Reads the same `6_final.def` (+ optional `6_final.spef`) as the labels, so feature
      rows join the label rows on `graph_id`+`inst_name`/`net_name`. Fail-soft; SPEF
      absence degrades cap columns to 0.
    - Platform-agnostic: liberty/tech-lef are resolved from the ORFS platform config and
      cell-type/routing-layer vocabularies adapt per platform. See
      `references/feature-extraction.md`.
    - Batch backfill across completed designs: `tools/run_features_batch.sh`.
14. Diagnose issues: `scripts/reports/build_diagnosis.py <project-root> reports/diagnosis.json`
15. Get config suggestions: `knowledge/suggest_config.py <project-dir>` (optional, useful for tuning)
16. Collect artifacts with `scripts/reports/collect_reports.py` and summarize with `scripts/reports/summarize_run.py`.
17. Generate the dashboard with `scripts/dashboard/generate_multi_project_dashboard.py`.
    The index page carries two read-only knowledge-store panels at the top (above the
    project grid), computed by `scripts/reports/build_lineage_view.py`:
    - **Knowledge Store Health** — total runs, ORFS status distribution, % partial/unknown,
      learnable family/platform pairs (≥3 successes via `knowledge_db.is_success`), signoff
      positives, and whether `heuristics.json` is populated (the EMPTY case renders red — the
      screaming diagnostic that learning is inert).
    - **Config Tuning Provenance** — the `config_lineage` diff chain per design/platform
      (changed/added/removed config keys + orfs/drc/lvs outcome delta prev→cur).

    INVARIANT: these panels are a strictly descriptive, READ-ONLY projection over
    `knowledge.sqlite` / `config_lineage` / `heuristics.json` (opened `mode=ro`; the projection
    writes only JSON). They are NEVER wired into `suggest_config` as an auto-tuner. The
    config-variant lineage is a loose single-parent diff chain, not a true DAG.
18. Serve it with `scripts/dashboard/serve_multi_project_dashboard.py 8765`.

## MVP Scope

Default to an MVP flow that supports:
- Single module or small design
- Single clock domain
- Simple reset behavior
- Generated or hand-authored Verilog RTL
- Testbench-driven simulation
- Yosys synthesis
- ORFS backend run with nangate45 platform
- DRC signoff check
- LVS signoff check (where platform supports it)
- OpenRCX parasitic extraction (SPEF)
- Report collection, signoff summary, and dashboard

Escalate to the user before attempting CDC, multi-clock constraints, DFT, or signoff-quality closure.

### Macro / Hard Memory Designs (Validated)

Macro designs using fakeram45 on nangate45 are supported and validated (riscv32i, tinyRocket, swerv, bp_multi_top — all produce GDS + pass RCX). LVS passes for designs <150K cells; designs >150K cells may need extended LVS timeout.

Some designs instantiate hard memory macros (fakeram45 on nangate45, SRAM on sky130). These require extra config:

1. **Verilog blackbox stubs** — Provide module definitions for all macros referenced in the RTL. For designs using SYNTH_HIERARCHICAL=1, stubs must be actual module implementations (not `(* blackbox *)` attributes), because Yosys CELLMATCH pass needs cost info. Wrap the fakeram macros inside the BSG-style wrapper modules with real port connections.

2. **ADDITIONAL_LEFS / ADDITIONAL_LIBS** — Point to the platform's LEF and LIB files for each macro type.

3. **CDL_FILE for LVS** — The platform config.mk sets a default CDL_FILE that only includes standard cells. Macro designs need a combined CDL with both standard cells and fakeram subcircuit definitions. Use `override export CDL_FILE` (the `override` keyword is critical — without it, the platform config.mk, which is included after the design config, will silently overwrite your CDL_FILE).

4. **MACRO_PLACEMENT_TCL** — Provide a Tcl script for macro placement. Use `find_macros` (not `all_macros`) to check for macros, and call `global_placement` before `macro_placement`:
   ```tcl
   if {[find_macros] != ""} {
     global_placement -density [place_density_with_lb_addon] -pad_left 2 -pad_right 2
     macro_placement -halo {10 10} -style corner_max_wl
   }
   ```

5. **GDS_ALLOW_EMPTY** — Set `export GDS_ALLOW_EMPTY = fakeram.*` so ORFS allows empty GDS cells for the macro stubs.

6. **Safety flags** — Large macro designs need `SKIP_CTS_REPAIR_TIMING=1` and `SKIP_LAST_GASP=1` to avoid OpenROAD crashes.

### Behavioral SRAM Stubs (Alternative to Macro Mapping)

When the design's SRAM macros are *undefined* in the RTL set (e.g., Chipyard
BOOM's `freepdk45_sram_*`, generic foundry stubs without LEF/LIB) AND the
total memory bits are modest (<~256K bits), substitute **behavioral
flop-array implementations** instead of mapping to fakeram45.

Use `tools/gen_openram_behavioral_stubs.py <wrapper.v> <stubs.v>` (a repo-level helper in the agent-r2g repository — not bundled with the installed skill) to
auto-generate behavioral Verilog for every `freepdk45_sram_<ports>_<rows>x<cols>[_<gran>]`
referenced. The generator handles both `1rw0r` (single-port) and `1w1r`
(write-port + read-port, independent clocks) styles, with optional
write-mask granularity.

Why behavioral instead of fakeram45:
- fakeram45 is single-port only — cannot represent BOOM's `1w1r` macros.
- fakeram45 widths (32/39/64/etc.) don't match arbitrary BOOM widths
  (40, 44, 52, 56, 124) without padding waste.
- Behavioral stubs let Yosys infer memories cleanly; ORFS handles them
  as plain logic with no macro placement needed.

When NOT to use behavioral stubs:
- **Total memory bits > ~50K** — Yosys's `memory_map` pass turns each
  read port into a wide mux tree. At BOOM SmallSEBoom's 168K total bits,
  the post-mapping cell count exceeds ~1M gates and ABC's `speed`
  script grinds beyond the 4 h `ORFS_TIMEOUT`. The earlier guidance
  (512K) was too optimistic; lowered after a 2h28m ABC failure.
- Designs that need real silicon (taping out) — use real macros.
- The skill currently caps `SYNTH_MEMORY_MAX_BITS` per memory at 65536.
  Single memories larger than that should use real macros.

When behavioral stubs hit the ABC ceiling but you still want to avoid
real macros, try **`SYNTH_HIERARCHICAL=1`** before switching to fakeram45.
With hierarchical synth, ABC is invoked separately per Yosys module —
each `freepdk45_sram_*` stub becomes its own small ABC run (≤32K gates
per memory) instead of one giant 1M-gate ABC pass.

**Validated:**
- DMA-class designs (Faraday DMA, ff_ram flop array): pass behavioral.
- AES / ibex / CRC / iscas89 (no SRAM macros, total memory ≤ ~10K bits): pass.
- **Faraday RISC** (3 unique `tsyncram_*` sizes, 87K total memory bits,
  79 RTL files, dual SYSCLK/BUSCLK): synth passes in 213 s under
  `SYNTH_HIERARCHICAL=1` + `ABC_AREA=1`. Yosys peak 553 MB; ABC ran
  per kept module (5 ABC invocations, 57 s combined). Confirms
  hierarchical mode lifts the behavioral ceiling well past the 50K-bit
  flat-mode limit when single memories stay <16K bits each.
- BOOM SmallSEBoom (17 SRAM types, 168K total memory bits, ~360K-line top):
  flat-mode ABC fails (2h28m wall, 5.36 GB peak). Retry with
  `SYNTH_HIERARCHICAL=1` is the recommended next step; if that still
  fails, fall back to mapping the four `1rw0r` macros (61K bits total)
  to `fakeram45` and keep the thirteen `1w1r` macros behavioral.
- See `docs/faraday_viability.md` for the per-design SRAM scale audit.

## ORFS Backend Details

### config.mk Format

```makefile
export DESIGN_NAME = <top_module>
export PLATFORM    = nangate45

export VERILOG_FILES = <absolute_path_to_rtl>
export SDC_FILE      = <absolute_path_to_sdc>

export CORE_UTILIZATION = 30
export PLACE_DENSITY_LB_ADDON = 0.20
```

For macro designs, add (note the `override` on CDL_FILE):
```makefile
export ADDITIONAL_LEFS = $(PLATFORM_DIR)/lef/fakeram45_64x32.lef
export ADDITIONAL_LIBS = $(PLATFORM_DIR)/lib/fakeram45_64x32.lib
export GDS_ALLOW_EMPTY = fakeram.*
export MACRO_PLACEMENT_TCL = /absolute/path/to/macro_placement.tcl
override export CDL_FILE = /absolute/path/to/combined_with_fakerams.cdl
```

The `override` keyword on CDL_FILE is essential: ORFS includes the platform config.mk *after* the design config.mk, so a bare `export CDL_FILE` gets silently overwritten by the platform default (which only has standard cells).

For sky130 (and any design whose RTL contains port-to-port `assign out = in` feedthroughs),
also add the stage hook that keeps Netgen LVS top-level pins matchable:
```makefile
# Split port-to-port feedthrough nets so Netgen LVS top-level pins match
export POST_GLOBAL_PLACE_TCL = <skill>/scripts/flow/orfs_hooks/buffer_port_feedthroughs.tcl
```
Set it in config.mk (not the shell — ORFS scrubs exported variables). It is a no-op for
designs without feedthroughs, so it is safe to set unconditionally.

### config.mk Validation Rules (Hard)

Before running ORFS, validate every config.mk against these rules:

1. **PLACE_DENSITY_LB_ADDON ≥ 0.10** — Values below 0.10 cause placement divergence (NesterovSolve stuck). Use 0.20+ for macro designs.
2. **Bus-heavy designs need CORE_UTILIZATION ≤ 15%** — Crossbars, interconnect fabrics, and bus arbiters have high routing demand.
3. **Large macro designs need safety flags** — Designs with >50K instances or SRAM macros (swerv, black_parrot, ibex) must include:
   ```makefile
   export SKIP_CTS_REPAIR_TIMING = 1
   export SKIP_LAST_GASP = 1
   ```
   Without these, OpenROAD may SIGSEGV during CTS timing repair.
4. **All VERILOG_FILES must be absolute paths** and point to existing files.
5. **DESIGN_NAME must exactly match the RTL top module name.**

### constraint.sdc Format

```tcl
current_design <top_module>
set clk_name  core_clock
set clk_port_name clk
set clk_period 10.0
set clk_io_pct 0.2

set clk_port [get_ports $clk_port_name]
create_clock -name $clk_name -period $clk_period $clk_port

set non_clock_inputs [all_inputs -no_clocks]
set_input_delay  [expr $clk_period * $clk_io_pct] -clock $clk_name $non_clock_inputs
set_output_delay [expr $clk_period * $clk_io_pct] -clock $clk_name [all_outputs]
```

### Running ORFS

The `scripts/flow/run_orfs.sh` script:
1. Copies RTL and constraints to an ORFS-compatible design directory
2. Derives a unique `FLOW_VARIANT` from the project directory name (prevents collisions)
3. Runs `make DESIGN_CONFIG=<config.mk> FLOW_VARIANT=<variant>` with optional timeout
4. Collects results back to the project directory

Resource control via environment variables:
```bash
ORFS_TIMEOUT=7200    # Per-stage max runtime in seconds (default: 2 hours)
ORFS_MAX_CPUS=4      # Limit CPU cores via taskset (default: all)
PLACE_FAST=1         # Disable GPL_TIMING_DRIVEN/ROUTABILITY_DRIVEN — use for
                     # BOOM-class designs (>1M nets) where the timing-repair
                     # loop in gpl spins for hours after Nesterov has already
                     # converged. CTS/route still apply timing closure.
ROUTE_FAST=1         # Cap GRT iterations + skip optional GRT-stage repair
                     # passes. Sets SKIP_INCREMENTAL_REPAIR=1,
                     # SKIP_ANTENNA_REPAIR=1, DETAILED_ROUTE_END_ITERATION=10,
                     # GLOBAL_ROUTE_ARGS='-congestion_iterations 5
                     # -allow_congestion -verbose ...'. Use when GRT extra
                     # iterations cycle 1→30 forever on >1M-net designs
                     # (BOOM ChipTop). Result: GDS may have congestion/DRC
                     # but produces final ODB.
ROUTE_FAST_SKIP_DRT=1  # Combined with ROUTE_FAST: also SKIP_DETAILED_ROUTE=1.
                       # Last-resort fallback — produces DEF + GRT solution
                       # but no GDS. Use only when ROUTE_FAST still hangs in
                       # detailed routing.
FROM_STAGE=place     # Resume from a specific stage (synth|floorplan|place|cts|route|finish)
```

### Shell Script Safety Rules (Validated Against 70 Designs)

These rules are enforced in all 6 execution scripts (`run_orfs.sh`, `run_lvs.sh`, `run_rcx.sh`, `run_drc.sh`, `run_magic_drc.sh`, `run_netgen_lvs.sh`):

1. **PIPESTATUS capture** — When piping `timeout ... | tee`, temporarily disable `set -e` and `pipefail` to capture the correct exit code:
   ```bash
   set +e +o pipefail
   setsid timeout ... make ... 2>&1 | tee logfile
   STATUS=${PIPESTATUS[0]}
   set -e -o pipefail
   ```
   Never use `|| true` after a pipeline — it resets PIPESTATUS to 0 and masks all failures.

2. **Environment isolation** — Always `unset SCRIPTS_DIR` before calling ORFS make. ORFS Makefile uses this variable internally; an external value causes "No rule to make target synth.sh" errors.

3. **Process group kills** — Use `setsid timeout` (not bare `timeout`) so the entire process tree is killed on timeout. Without `setsid`, grandchild processes (klayout, openroad) survive as zombies, consuming memory and holding file locks.

4. **LVS timeout scaling** — Default `LVS_TIMEOUT=3600` works for designs <100K cells. For swerv-class (~145K), use 4200s. For bp_multi_top-class (~200K), use 7200s. ORFS and RCX always complete within default timeouts.

### Running Signoff After ORFS

After a successful ORFS run, the signoff scripts operate on the ORFS results in-place:

- `run_drc.sh` — runs `make DESIGN_CONFIG=<config.mk> drc` in ORFS flow directory (KLayout)
- `run_magic_drc.sh` — runs Magic DRC with sky130A tech file (sky130 only)
- `run_lvs.sh` — runs `make DESIGN_CONFIG=<config.mk> lvs` in ORFS flow directory (KLayout)
- `run_netgen_lvs.sh` — extracts SPICE via Magic, compares with Netgen (sky130 only)
- `run_rcx.sh` — runs OpenROAD directly with a generated Tcl script reading `6_final.odb`

All scripts collect results back to the project's `drc/`, `lvs/`, `rcx/` directories and also copy them into the latest `backend/RUN_*/` subdirectory.
