# Voice Extractor

Extract authentic voice characteristics from transcripts to enhance author profiles.

## Purpose

Transform transcript data (podcasts, interviews, meetings, videos) into actionable writing guidelines that capture an author's authentic voice, making AI-generated content sound natural and personal.

## When to Use

- Author has recordings/transcripts of themselves speaking
- Want to capture authentic speaking patterns
- Need to enhance a manually-created author profile
- Building a new author profile from scratch using transcripts
- Refining an existing profile with more data

## Workflow

### 1. Prepare Transcripts

Accept transcripts in these formats:
- Plain text: `Speaker: text`
- Timestamped: `[00:01:23] Speaker: text` or `59:54 Speaker: text`
- Bracketed: `[Speaker]: text`
- WhatsApp: `[17:30, 12/6/2025] Speaker: text`
- SRT subtitles: Standard subtitle format

**If user provides audio/video without transcript:**
Suggest transcription services:
- YouTube auto-captions (downloadable)
- Otter.ai, Descript
- OpenAI Whisper (local)
- Rev.com

### 2. Run Analysis

```bash
# List speakers in transcript
bun run "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/voice-extractor.ts --list-speakers transcript.txt

# Extract for specific speaker
bun run "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/voice-extractor.ts --speaker "Name" transcript.txt

# Multiple transcripts (more data = better profile)
bun run "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/voice-extractor.ts --speaker "Name" t1.txt t2.txt t3.txt

# Output JSON for direct use with author profiles
bun run "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/voice-extractor.ts --speaker "Name" --json transcript.txt
```

### 3. Enhance Author Profile

The extracted data enhances these author fields:

| Extracted Data | Maps To |
|---------------|---------|
| Communication style | `tone.formality`, `tone.opinionated` |
| Characteristic expressions | `phrases.signature` |
| Sentence starters | `phrases.signature` |
| Signature vocabulary | `vocabulary.use_freely` |
| Speaking style | `notes` |

### 4. Manual Enhancement

After automated extraction, read transcript samples to identify:

- **Unique phrases**: Catchphrases missed by frequency analysis
- **Humor style**: Sarcasm, self-deprecation, wit patterns
- **Story structure**: How they set up anecdotes
- **Cultural markers**: Regional expressions, analogies
- **Topic emphasis**: What makes them animated

## What Gets Extracted

### Sentence Structure
- Average sentence length
- Variety (short/moderate/long/complex)
- Question frequency

### Communication Style
- Enthusiasm (love, amazing, awesome)
- Hedging (maybe, perhaps, I think)
- Certainty (definitely, absolutely)
- Empathy (understand, appreciate)
- Directness (need to, must, bottom line)
- Storytelling (so, and then, eventually)
- Analytical (because, therefore, however)

### Characteristic Expressions
- Fillers: "you know", "I mean", "like", "right"
- Hedgers: "kind of", "sort of", "I guess"
- Emphatics: "honestly", "literally", "definitely"

### Vocabulary
- Signature words used frequently
- Vocabulary richness percentage

## Integration with Author Profile

### New Author from Transcript

```bash
# 1. Extract voice data
/article-writer:author analyze --speaker "John" transcripts/*.txt

# 2. Review and confirm extraction
# Claude will show extracted patterns

# 3. Add identity info
/article-writer:author add
# Answer: name, role, expertise, languages

# 4. Merge voice data
# Claude will combine extracted + manual data
```

### Enhance Existing Author

```bash
# 1. Extract from new transcripts
/article-writer:author analyze --speaker "John" --author-id mwguerra new_podcast.txt

# 2. Review changes
# Claude shows what will be updated

# 3. Confirm merge
# Voice analysis data added to existing profile
```

### Markdown Report

```markdown
# Voice Analysis: John Smith

*Analyzed 156 speaking turns, 12,450 words*

## Speaking Style
- **Sentence length**: Moderate (~14 words avg)
- **Questions**: Uses questions occasionally (12%)
- **Vocabulary richness**: 45% unique words

## Communication Style
- **Primary**: Enthusiastic (28%)
- **Secondary**: Analytical (24%)
- **Tertiary**: Direct (19%)

## Characteristic Expressions
- "you know" (used 45x)
- "I think" (used 38x)

---

## Recommendations for Author Profile

Based on this analysis:
- Set formality to 5 (conversational but professional)
- Set opinionated to 7 (confident, uses "I think" but states opinions)
- Add signature phrases: "you know", "the thing is"
- Use vocabulary freely: approach, strategy, implementation
```

## Quality Indicators

Good voice analysis needs:
- **100+ speaking turns** for reliable patterns
- **5,000+ words** for vocabulary analysis
- **Multiple contexts** (different topics/conversations)

Low data warning:
```
⚠️ Limited data: Only 23 speaking turns found.
   Results may not fully represent speaking patterns.
   Consider adding more transcripts.
```
