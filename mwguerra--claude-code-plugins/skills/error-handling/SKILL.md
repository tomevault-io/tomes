description: This skill should be used when encountering errors during development, when the user mentions an error, when debugging issues, or when asked to "fix an error", "debug this", "why is this failing", "solve this error". Provides intelligent error recognition, solution lookup from past errors, and error logging for future reference. Use when this capability is needed.

# Error Handling Skill

Handle errors intelligently by leveraging past solutions and building a knowledge base of fixes.

## Core Workflow

### When Encountering an Error

1. **Recognize the error** - Identify the error message and its type
2. **Search for solutions** - Check if a similar error was solved before
3. **Apply or adapt** - Use the found solution or develop a new one
4. **Log for future** - After solving, log the error and solution

### Error Recognition

Recognize errors from multiple sources:

| Source | Indicators |
|--------|------------|
| Bash commands | Non-zero exit code, stderr output, error keywords |
| Playwright/Browser | Console errors, network failures, page crashes |
| Log files | Error patterns in file content |
| Build output | Compilation failures, missing dependencies |
| API responses | HTTP 4xx/5xx status codes, error JSON |
| User messages | User describes or pastes an error |

**Error type keywords to watch for:**
- PHP/Laravel: `Fatal error`, `SQLSTATE`, `Exception`, `Class not found`
- JavaScript: `TypeError`, `ReferenceError`, `Cannot find module`
- Python: `Traceback`, `ImportError`, `AttributeError`
- Database: `Connection refused`, `Access denied`, `Table doesn't exist`
- Docker: `container is not running`, `port already allocated`

### Searching for Solutions

When an error is encountered:

```bash
# Search the error memory database
bash $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/search.sh "<error message>" --max 5
```

**Interpret confidence levels:**
- **100%**: Exact match - apply solution directly
- **70-99%**: Very similar - solution likely works, may need minor adaptation
- **50-69%**: Related error - review solution for applicability
- **30-49%**: Loosely related - use as reference only

### Logging New Errors

After solving an error not found in the database:

```bash
bash $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/log-error.sh --json '{
  "errorMessage": "<full error message>",
  "project": "<project name>",
  "projectPath": "<working directory>",
  "source": "<bash|playwright|read|user|build|api|other>",
  "whatHappened": "<what was being done when error occurred>",
  "cause": "<root cause of the error>",
  "solution": "<how it was fixed>",
  "rationale": "<why the solution works>",
  "fileChanged": "<optional: file that was modified>",
  "codeBefore": "<optional: code before fix>",
  "codeAfter": "<optional: code after fix>",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
}'
```

## Error Source Classification

Classify errors by their origin for better matching:

| Source | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| `bash` | Errors from shell commands, scripts, CLI tools |
| `playwright` | Browser errors, page load failures, element not found |
| `read` | Errors found when reading log files or error outputs |
| `user` | Errors the user describes or pastes directly |
| `build` | Compilation errors, asset building failures |
| `api` | HTTP errors, API response errors |
| `other` | Anything that doesn't fit above categories |

## Tagging Guidelines

Use consistent tags for better searchability:

**Technology tags:**
- Languages: `php`, `javascript`, `python`, `typescript`
- Frameworks: `laravel`, `react`, `vue`, `filament`, `livewire`
- Tools: `docker`, `composer`, `npm`, `git`

**Domain tags:**
- `database`, `api`, `auth`, `forms`, `validation`
- `routing`, `middleware`, `permissions`, `migrations`
- `testing`, `deployment`, `configuration`

**Error type tags:**
- `connection`, `syntax`, `runtime`, `type-error`
- `missing-dependency`, `permission`, `timeout`

## Available Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/error-memory:search <query>` | Search for similar errors |
| `/error-memory:log` | Log a new error interactively |
| `/error-memory:list` | List all stored errors |
| `/error-memory:show <id>` | View full error details |
| `/error-memory:stats` | View database statistics |
| `/error-memory:migrate` | Import from old solved-errors.md |
| `/error-memory:init` | Initialize the database |

## Proactive Error Handling

### Before Running Commands

If about to run a command that commonly fails:
1. Consider what errors might occur
2. Have error handling ready (try/catch, error codes)
3. Know where to look for solutions

### After Errors Occur

1. Don't immediately retry the same thing
2. Search for the error first
3. Understand the cause before applying a fix
4. Verify the fix actually resolved the issue
5. Log the solution for future reference

### Recognizing Patterns

Watch for recurring error patterns:
- Same error type across projects → systemic issue
- Same project with multiple errors → architectural problem
- Same tag appearing often → skill gap to address

## Integration with CLAUDE.md

The error memory system enhances the existing CLAUDE.md instruction to log errors to `~/.claude/solved-errors.md` by providing:
- Structured storage instead of markdown
- Intelligent search with fuzzy matching
- Usage tracking and statistics
- Automatic error detection via hooks

The old `solved-errors.md` can be migrated with `/error-memory:migrate`.
