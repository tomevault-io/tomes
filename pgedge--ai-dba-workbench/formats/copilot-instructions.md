## Primary Agent Role

**The primary agent acts primarily as a coordinator and manager.**
By default, productive work flows through specialized sub-agents;
the primary agent only handles a narrow set of trivial changes
directly (see "Trivial-Edit Carve-Out" below). This split keeps
the primary's context clean for coordination while avoiding the
overhead of dispatching a sub-agent for one-line fixes.

The primary agent's responsibilities are:

- Understanding user requirements and breaking them into tasks.

- Selecting appropriate sub-agents for each task.

- Delegating implementation work to sub-agents.

- Coordinating between multiple sub-agents when tasks span domains.

- Synthesizing sub-agent results for the user.

- Running verification commands (e.g., `make test-all`) after sub-agents
  complete their work.

- Handling trivial direct edits that meet every condition in the
  carve-out below.

### Trivial-Edit Carve-Out

The primary agent MAY edit files directly only when ALL of the
following are true:

- The change touches a single file.

- The change is no more than 20 lines (added + removed combined).

- Identifying the change took at most two tool calls (typically one
  Read or Grep, plus one Edit).

- The change does not touch security-sensitive code: anything
  under `server/src/internal/auth/`, code that hashes passwords,
  manipulates tokens, performs RBAC checks, parses untrusted
  input, or constructs SQL.

- The change does not require updating a sub-agent knowledge-base
  file alongside it (the sub-agent owns its KB, so delegate when
  KB changes are needed).

- The change does not introduce or modify a public API or exported
  identifier.

Typical qualifying cases: typo or comment fix, single-line bug
fix at a known call-site, whitespace cleanup, adding or removing
a single import.

If any condition fails, delegate. When in doubt, delegate; the
sub-agent overhead is small compared to the cost of the primary
agent rationalising past this rule.

#### Named Exception: Release Version Bumps

Bumping the project version in preparation for a release is
explicitly a primary-agent task, even though it usually touches
several files (version strings in `package.json`, Go constants,
mkdocs config, etc.) and the changelog. It is mechanical,
high-frequency, and typically performed in a fresh conversation
anyway, so sub-agent overhead is pure cost with no quality
benefit. The primary agent may make these edits directly,
including the corresponding `docs/changelog.md` entry that
records the version bump itself; deeper changelog content for the
release should still flow through **documentation-writer**.

The primary agent must NEVER:

- Make multi-file changes directly, even when each individual
  file change is small.

- Edit production code in `collector/`, `server/`, `alerter/`, or
  `client/` that exceeds the carve-out above.

- Perform any task that a sub-agent could handle and that does
  not clearly fit the carve-out.

When uncertain which sub-agent to use, delegate to the built-in
**Explore** agent type for research and navigation tasks.

## Project Structure

The pgEdge AI DBA Workbench consists of four sub-projects:

- `/collector` - Data collector (Go).

- `/server` - MCP server (Go).

- `/alerter` - Alert monitoring service (Go).

- `/client` - Web client application (React/TypeScript).

Each sub-project follows this base structure:

- `/src` - Source code.

- `/tests` - Unit and integration tests (unless language convention places
  tests alongside source files).

- `/docs/<subproject>` - Documentation in markdown format with lowercase
  filenames.

## Key Files

Reference these files for project context:

- `docs/changelog.md` - Notable changes by release.

- `mkdocs.yml` - Documentation site navigation.

- `Makefile` - Build and test commands.

## Sub-Agents

Specialized sub-agents in `/.claude/agents/` handle the bulk of
implementation work. The primary agent delegates by default and
only edits directly within the Trivial-Edit Carve-Out above.

### Delegation Mapping

Anything outside the Trivial-Edit Carve-Out must be delegated.
Use this mapping to select the correct sub-agent:

| Task Type                      | Sub-Agent                     |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Go code (any change)           | **golang-expert**             |
| Go tests and test strategy     | **golang-expert**             |
| Go code review                 | **golang-expert**             |
| MCP protocol and tools         | **golang-expert**             |
| React/TypeScript code          | **react-expert**              |
| React tests and test strategy  | **react-expert**              |
| React code review              | **react-expert**              |
| Documentation changes          | **documentation-writer**      |
| PostgreSQL questions           | **postgres-expert**           |
| Spock/replication questions    | **postgres-expert**           |
| Security review                | **security-auditor**          |
| General exploration/research   | **Explore** (built-in agent)  |

Sub-agents have full access to the codebase and can both advise and write
code directly. The primary agent's role is to coordinate their work and
present results to the user.

### Available Sub-Agents

**Implementation Agents** (can write code):

- **golang-expert** - Go development: features, bugs, architecture,
  review. Also handles MCP protocol implementation, test strategy,
  and code review for all Go code.

- **react-expert** - React/MUI development: components, features, bugs.
  Also handles test strategy and code review for React code.

- **documentation-writer** - Documentation following project style guide.

**Advisory Agents** (research and recommend):

- **postgres-expert** - PostgreSQL administration, tuning,
  troubleshooting. Also covers Spock replication topics.

- **security-auditor** - Security review, vulnerability detection, OWASP.

Implementation agents follow the conventions documented in CLAUDE.md
and their own knowledge bases. Use the built-in **Explore** agent for
codebase navigation and general research tasks.

Each sub-agent has a knowledge base in `/.claude/<agent-name>/` containing
domain-specific patterns and project conventions.

When a task changes code documented in a knowledge base file, the
sub-agent must update the affected KB file in the same change.
The primary agent should verify that relevant KB entries remain
accurate after each task completes. KB files that
become stale or inaccurate are worse than having no KB file at all;
delete or correct any entry that no longer matches the code.

## Plans and Specs

Store all plans in the `.claude/plans/` directory. Store all design
specs in the `.claude/specs/` directory. Use descriptive filenames
that reflect the task or feature being planned.

## Development Worktrees

All development work is performed in a dedicated git worktree by
default. The worktree keeps the main checkout clean and isolates
concurrent tasks from one another; this prevents in-flight changes
from one task contaminating another.

The default applies to every task unless the developer explicitly
requests that the work happen in the main checkout or otherwise
overrides the default. The primary agent should confirm any such
override before proceeding.

When dispatching sub-agents that perform implementation work, invoke
them with worktree isolation where the Agent tool supports it; for
example, pass `isolation: "worktree"` so each sub-agent operates in
its own isolated tree. Advisory and research sub-agents that do not
modify files do not require worktree isolation.

## Pull Request Workflow

Before pushing any PR branch, Claude must check whether the branch is
behind `main` and rebase onto the latest `main` if it is. This rule
applies both when opening a new pull request and when pushing further
commits to an existing one; the goal is to keep the PR history linear,
ensure CI runs against the current `main`, and avoid merge-conflict
surprises at review time.

The required pre-push procedure is as follows:

- Fetch the latest `main` from the remote with `git fetch origin main`.

- Compare the PR branch against `origin/main` to determine whether the
  branch is behind; for example, inspect `git rev-list --left-right
  --count origin/main...HEAD`.

- If the branch is behind, rebase it onto the latest `main` with
  `git rebase origin/main` before pushing.

- Resolve any conflicts that arise during the rebase rather than
  aborting the rebase or force-overwriting the conflicting files; only
  ask the developer for guidance when the conflicts cannot be resolved
  cleanly.

- After a successful rebase, push the rebased branch with
  `git push --force-with-lease`; never use a plain `git push --force`,
  because `--force-with-lease` refuses to overwrite remote work that
  Claude has not seen.

- Never force-push to `main` itself, regardless of circumstance; the
  force-push allowance applies only to the PR branch.

## Task Workflow

The primary agent follows this workflow for all tasks:

1. **Understand** - Clarify requirements with the user if needed.

2. **Plan** - Break the task into sub-tasks and identify required sub-agents.

3. **Delegate** - Dispatch each sub-task to the appropriate sub-agent.
   For multi-domain tasks, coordinate multiple sub-agents in sequence or
   parallel as appropriate.

4. **Verify** - After sub-agents complete their work, run `make test-all`
   to ensure all tests pass. Confirm every sub-agent delivering code has
   also delivered tests that meet the 90% coverage floor described in
   the Tests section; reject output that does not.

5. **Review** - For security-sensitive changes (auth, input handling,
   queries), delegate to **security-auditor** for review.

6. **Document** - For user-facing changes, delegate to
   **documentation-writer** to update `docs/changelog.md`.

7. **Report** - Synthesize sub-agent results and present a summary to
   the user.

**Remember:** The primary agent delegates by default. The only
exception is the Trivial-Edit Carve-Out documented under "Primary
Agent Role"; anything outside that carve-out must come from a
sub-agent.

## Documentation

### General Guidelines

- Place a `README.md` in each sub-project directory with a high-level
  overview and getting started information.

- Create an `index.md` as the entry point for each sub-project's docs;
  link to this file from the sub-project README.

- Link the top-level `README.md` to each sub-project README.

- Wrap all markdown files at 79 characters or less.

- Place `LICENSE.md` in both `/docs` and the repository root.

### Writing Style

- Use active voice.

- Write grammatically correct sentences between 7 and 20 words.

- Use semicolons to link related ideas or manage long sentences.

- Use articles (a, an, the) appropriately.

- Avoid ambiguous pronoun references; only use "it" when the referent is
  in the same sentence.

### Document Structure

- Use one first-level heading per file with multiple second-level headings.

- Limit third and fourth-level headings to prominent content only.

- Include an introductory sentence or paragraph after each heading.

- For Features or Overview sections, use the format: "The MCP Server
  includes the following features:" followed by a bulleted list.

### Lists

- Leave a blank line before the first item in any list or sub-list.

- Write each bullet as a complete sentence with articles.

- Do not bold bullet items.

- Use numbered lists only for sequential steps.

### Code Snippets

- Precede code with an explanatory sentence: "In the following example,
  the `command_name` command uses..."

- Use backticks for inline code: `SELECT * FROM table;`

- Use fenced code blocks with language tags for multi-line code:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM code;
  ```

- Format `stdio`, `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` in backticks.

- Capitalise SQL keywords; use lowercase for variables.

### Links and References

- Link files outside `/docs` to their GitHub location.

- Include third-party installation/documentation links in Prerequisites.

- Link to the GitHub repo when referencing cloning or project work.

- Do not link to github.io.

### README.md Files

At the top of each README:

- GitHub Action badges for repository actions.

- Test deployment links (if applicable).

- Table of Contents mirroring the `mkdocs.yml` nav section.

- Link to online docs at docs.pgedge.com.

README body content:

- Getting started steps.

- Prerequisites with commands and third-party links.

- Build/install commands and minimal configuration notes.

- Deployment section linking to Installation, Configuration, and Usage
  pages in `/docs`.

At the end of each README:

- Issues link: "To report an issue with the software, visit:"

- Developer link: "We welcome your project contributions; for more
  information, see docs/developer-guide/contributing.md."

- Online docs link: "For more information, visit
  [docs.pgedge.com](https://docs.pgedge.com)"

- License (final line): "This project is licensed under the
  [PostgreSQL License](LICENSE.md)."

### Additional Documentation Requirements

- Match all sample output to actual output.

- Document all command-line options.

- Include well-commented examples for all configuration options.

- Keep documentation synchronized with code for CLI options, configuration,
  and environment variables.

- Update `changelog.md` with notable changes since the last release.

## Tests

- Provide unit and integration tests for each sub-project.

- Execute tests with `go test` or `npm test` as appropriate.

- Write automated tests for all functions and features; use mocking where
  needed.

- Run all tests after any changes; check for errors and warnings that may
  be hidden by output redirection or truncation.

- Clean up temporary test files on completion; retain log files for
  debugging.

- Modify existing tests only when the tested functionality changes or to
  fix bugs.

- Include linting in standard test suites using locally installable tools.

- Enable coverage checking in standard test suites.

- All new and modified code must reach at least 90% line coverage;
  this is a hard, non-negotiable floor and not an aspirational target.

- The 90% floor applies to every change, no matter how small; when
  you modify a file or package whose current coverage is below 90%,
  raise the touched unit to 90% as part of the same change.

- Measure Go coverage per sub-project with `cd <subproject> && make
  coverage`, which runs `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...`;
  inspect the numeric result with `go tool cover -func=coverage.out`.

- Measure client coverage with `cd client && make coverage`, which
  runs `npm run test:coverage` (Vitest with `@vitest/coverage-v8`);
  the text reporter prints per-file line coverage.

- Run `make test-all` from the repository root to execute the full
  suite across all sub-projects before completing a task.

- A task is not complete until new and modified code meets the 90%
  coverage floor, verified by the coverage tooling above; do not
  mark work done on the basis of passing tests alone.

- Run `gofmt` on all Go files.

- Ensure `make test` runs all test suites.

- Do not skip database tests when testing changes.

- **After any code change, always run `gofmt` (for Go) and all relevant
  linters before considering the task complete.** A task is not finished
  until formatting and linting pass with no errors or warnings.

- Run `make test-all` in the top-level directory before completing a task.

## API Specification

- Keep the OpenAPI specification in
  `server/src/internal/api/openapi.go` synchronized with
  the server code at all times.

- When adding, modifying, or removing an HTTP endpoint, update the
  corresponding path entry and schemas in `BuildOpenAPISpec`.

- Update the endpoint summary table in
  `docs/admin-guide/api/reference.md` to match the current API
  surface.

- Regenerate the static OpenAPI file after any specification change:
  `cd server && make openapi`.

- Run the OpenAPI tests after any specification change:
  `cd server/src && go test ./internal/api/ -run OpenAPI -v`.

- The interactive API browser at `docs/admin-guide/api/reference.md`
  renders from the static file `docs/admin-guide/api/openapi.json`;
  verify that new endpoints appear correctly in the ReDoc output.

## Security

- Maintain isolation between user sessions.

- Restrict database connections to their owning users or tokens.

- Protect against injection attacks at client and server; the exception is
  MCP tools that execute arbitrary SQL queries.

- Follow industry best practices for defensive secure coding.

- Review all changes for security implications; report potential issues.

## Browser Automation (playwright-cli)

The project has `playwright-cli` installed as a Claude Code skill at
`.claude/skills/playwright-cli/SKILL.md`. Use this tool for browser
testing, form filling, screenshots, and web interaction.

- `playwright-cli` is a standalone CLI tool; it is NOT the Playwright
  MCP server or the npm `playwright` package.

- Do not attempt to install Playwright via `npx playwright install`,
  `npm install playwright`, or `npx @anthropic-ai/playwright-mcp`.

- Do not use `npx playwright` commands; use `playwright-cli` directly.

- Run commands via `Bash(playwright-cli:*)` tool calls (for example,
  `playwright-cli open`, `playwright-cli click e5`).

- Use the `--headed` flag on `playwright-cli open` when the user
  wants to see the browser window.

- After each command, a snapshot YAML file is written to
  `.playwright-cli/` (gitignored). Read the snapshot to find element
  refs (for example, `e31`, `e37`) for subsequent interactions.

- Refs change after navigation and interaction; take a fresh
  `playwright-cli snapshot` if refs become stale.

- The skill file at `.claude/skills/playwright-cli/SKILL.md` contains
  the full command reference.

- After completing UI changes, use `playwright-cli` to validate the
  changes visually in a browser session. This supplements unit and
  integration tests by catching rendering, interaction, and
  navigation issues that automated tests may miss.

## Code Style

- Use four spaces for indentation.

- Write readable, extensible, and appropriately modularised code.

- Minimise code duplication; refactor as needed.

- Follow language-specific best practices.

- Remove unused code.

- Use `COMMENT ON` to describe objects in database migrations.

- Include this copyright notice at the top of every source file (not
  configuration files); adjust comment style for the language:
