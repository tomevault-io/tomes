# Creating Claude Skills

## Quick Start

Create a skill by making a `SKILL.md` file in `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: Brief description of what this skill does and when to use it.
---

# My Skill Name

## Instructions
[Your instructions here]
```

## Required Structure

Every skill needs:

1. **SKILL.md file** with YAML frontmatter
2. **name field**: lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only (max 64 chars)
3. **description field**: what the skill does AND when to use it (max 1024 chars)

## Skill Directory Layout

```
.claude/skills/
└── my-skill/
    ├── SKILL.md          # Main instructions (required)
    ├── reference.md      # Additional details (optional)
    └── scripts/          # Utility scripts (optional)
        └── helper.py
```

## Writing the Description

The description is critical for skill discovery. Include:
- What the skill does
- When Claude should use it
- Key trigger words

**Good example:**
```yaml
description: Generate git commit messages by analyzing staged changes. Use when committing code, writing commit messages, or reviewing diffs.
```

**Bad example:**
```yaml
description: Helps with git stuff
```

## Skill Templates

### Template 1: Instructions-Only Skill

For guidance-based skills without code:

```markdown
---
name: code-review
description: Review code for bugs, style, and best practices. Use when reviewing pull requests, analyzing code quality, or checking for issues.
---

# Code Review

## Process

1. Read the code thoroughly
2. Check for bugs and edge cases
3. Verify style consistency
4. Suggest improvements

## Checklist

- [ ] No obvious bugs
- [ ] Error handling present
- [ ] Consistent naming
- [ ] No security issues
```

### Template 2: Skill with Scripts

For skills that include executable utilities:

```markdown
---
name: data-validation
description: Validate data files against schemas. Use when checking CSV, JSON, or config file formats.
---

# Data Validation

## Usage

Run validation:
```bash
python scripts/validate.py input.json schema.json
```

## Scripts

- **validate.py**: Check data against schema
- **format.py**: Auto-fix formatting issues

See [reference.md](reference.md) for schema format details.
```

### Template 3: Domain-Specific Skill

For skills with extensive reference material:

```markdown
---
name: api-integration
description: Integrate with the Acme API. Use when calling Acme endpoints, handling Acme webhooks, or processing Acme data.
---

# Acme API Integration

## Quick Reference

Base URL: `https://api.acme.com/v2`
Auth: Bearer token in header

## Common Operations

**Get user**: `GET /users/{id}`
**Create order**: `POST /orders`

For complete endpoint docs, see [endpoints.md](endpoints.md).
For authentication details, see [auth.md](auth.md).
```

## Best Practices

### Be Concise
Claude is smart. Only include information Claude doesn't already know.

### Use Progressive Disclosure
- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines
- Put detailed reference material in separate files
- Link with relative paths: `[details](reference.md)`

### Set Appropriate Freedom

**High freedom** (guidelines):
```markdown
Review the code for potential issues and suggest improvements.
```

**Low freedom** (specific steps):
```markdown
Run exactly: `python scripts/migrate.py --verify --backup`
Do not modify the command.
```

### Include Workflows for Complex Tasks

```markdown
## Deployment Workflow

1. Run tests: `bun test`
2. Build: `bun run build`
3. If build fails, fix errors and repeat from step 1
4. Deploy: `bun run deploy`
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Using vague descriptions
- Including time-sensitive information
- Using Windows-style paths (use forward slashes)
- Offering too many options without a default
- Deeply nesting file references (keep one level deep)

## File Naming

Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens:
- `api-reference.md` (good)
- `APIREF.md` (bad)
- `scripts/validate-schema.py` (good)
- `scripts/vs.py` (bad)

## Testing Your Skill

1. Create the skill files
2. Start a new conversation
3. Make a request that should trigger the skill
4. Verify Claude uses the skill correctly
5. Iterate based on behavior
