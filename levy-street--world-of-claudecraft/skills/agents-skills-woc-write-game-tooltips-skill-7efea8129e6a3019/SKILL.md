# Write game tooltips

Write tooltips from the live mechanic, not from existing prose.

## Workflow

1. Read `docs/design/tooltip-writing.md` in full.
2. Inspect the content record, runtime handlers, resolved ability path, and focused tests.
3. Record the target, result, timing, values, scaling stat, triggers, caps, and consumption rules.
4. Rewrite the authoritative English source in short, direct sentences.
5. Use live resolved values when rank, gear, talents, or specialization can change a number.
6. Add or update a focused test that compares the tooltip with the combat result.
7. Run the relevant mechanic, tooltip, i18n, and type checks.

## Rules

- Do not claim scaling that the combat path does not use.
- Name Attack Power, Ranged Attack Power, Spell Power, weapon damage, pet state, or flat damage
  correctly.
- State every important trigger, cap, stack, target limit, reset, and resource change.
- Explain named states in plain English.
- Do not repeat metadata without a clear reason.
- Edit English sources first. Do not hand-edit locale overlays or generated i18n output.

Stop and record a mismatch when the code and intended design disagree. Do not make the tooltip
promise unfinished behavior.
