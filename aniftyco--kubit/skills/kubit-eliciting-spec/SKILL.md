# Eliciting Spec for Kubit Subsystems

## Overview

Extract detailed requirements through structured questions, then capture decisions in SPEC.md with the standard template.

## When to Use

- User mentions expanding a subsystem (Router, ORM, Queue, Mail, etc.)
- Discussing goals, non-goals, or API shape for any feature
- Need to resolve open questions in SPEC.md
- Designing new framework capability

## General Prompts (Ask Per Subsystem)

| Area | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Scope | Goals vs non-goals? What's MVP vs later? |
| Data | Inputs/outputs? Data shapes? |
| Flow | Step-by-step lifecycle? Extension points? |
| Config | Knobs, defaults, override mechanisms? |
| Errors | Failure modes? Error types? How surfaced? |
| Edge Cases | Tricky scenarios to support or reject? |
| Security | AuthN/Z, CSRF, CORS, secrets, privacy? |
| Performance | Latency, streaming, caching, batching? |
| Extensibility | Hooks, interfaces, adapters, plugins? |
| Testing | What tests prove it? Fixtures needed? |
| Open Questions | Undecided items → add to SPEC |

## Subsystem Deep-Dive Prompts

**HTTP Kernel:** Request/response abstraction (Node vs Web)? Streaming? Middleware pipeline order? Error handling policy? Static vs app route precedence? 404/405/500 behavior?

**Router:** Path syntax, params, constraints? Trailing slash, case sensitivity? Named routes, reverse routing? Route groups, per-route middleware? Controller action resolution?

**Controllers & DI:** Construction via DI or factories? Access to request/config? Return types (text, JSON, redirects, view(), streams)? Validation strategy?

**Views & Inertia:** Envelope shape `{ component, props, url, version }`? Layouts? Hydration and bundle splitting? Asset manifest? Client runtime duties? Forms/links enhancement?

**ORM/DB:** Table builder DSL surface? Migration runner (tracking table, up/down, transactions)? Seeding?

**Queue/Jobs:** Dispatch API? Queue names, retries/backoff? Idempotency, scheduling? Worker lifecycle, graceful shutdown?

**Mail:** Rendering API? Transport abstraction? Attachments? Preview/dev mailbox? Test fakes?

**CLI:** Commands, flags? Config discovery? Watch mode? Error UX?

## Subsystem Spec Template

When documenting in SPEC.md, use this structure:

```markdown
## [Subsystem Name]

### Goals
### Non-Goals
### Concepts & Vocabulary
### API Surface (TypeScript)
### Configuration
### Lifecycle & Control Flow
### Edge Cases & Errors
### Security & Privacy
### Performance & Scaling
### Extensibility & Integration Points
### Testing Strategy & Fixtures
### Open Questions
### Alternatives Considered
```

## Capturing Decisions

When a decision is made, add to SPEC.md Decision Log:

```markdown
## Decision Log

### YYYY-MM-DD: [Decision Title]
**Context:** [What prompted this]
**Decision:** [What was decided]
**Rationale:** [Why]
**Alternatives rejected:** [What else was considered]
```
