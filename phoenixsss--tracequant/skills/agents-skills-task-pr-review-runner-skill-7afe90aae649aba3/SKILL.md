# Task PR review runner

Use this Skill only in a fresh session that did not implement or remediate the head
being reviewed. The Task number is the only mechanical key supplied to LCK; a PR
number mentioned by the maintainer is intent, not authority.

Read applicable `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/policies/command-execution.md`. Read only
the Review portions needed from `.agents/policies/workflow-evidence.md`,
`docs/workflows/lck/review-and-remediation.md`, and
`docs/workflows/lck/lifecycle.md`. Those owners define validation/evidence
consumption, freshness, and shared lifecycle semantics.

Before the first LCK command, verify `command -v uv`, `uv --version`, and
`uv run --frozen python --version`. A launcher failure is not a Review verdict.

## Execution route contract

`review prepare`, `review complete`, and `merge preflight` (including the
`merge-preflight` compatibility alias) use `sandbox-first`. These operations
keep the source repository read-only; Review's temporary clone and ignored LCK
runtime state remain operation-owned exceptions defined by this contract. This
classification is selected from the exact LCK invocation before it starts.

The route only selects the execution context for a command already authorized
by this Skill and LCK. It never grants GitHub, lifecycle, merge, or write
authority, and Review must not be rerouted through a generic elevated `uv`,
`python`, `git`, or `gh` rule. Preserve the exact-context retry rules below for
a genuine `sandbox-denied` or `credential-isolated` result.

Creating, sealing, or removing the Review clone is expected to work in the
normal sandbox and is not by itself a reason to elevate the LCK command. A known
required write route should be correct on the first formal call; do not
intentionally run a known-failing sandbox probe before an approved exact route.

`review prepare` and formal workflow validation are known heavyweight LCK
operations and use a fixed 30-second wait window for the first wait and every
subsequent still-running poll (for example,
`write_stdin`/`yield_time_ms=30000`). A process that exits earlier is returned
immediately; the 30-second value is a maximum wait window, not a minimum
runtime. Adaptive polling intervals are not part of the workflow contract.

Codex-only failure classes are `sandbox-denied` (local process, network, or an
exact ignored output path blocked) and `credential-isolated` (credentials
unavailable only in the current context). Only these two justify an
exact-context retry; a real command failure never justifies a broader-permission
retry or an equivalent direct command chain.

Read the optional ignored `.agents/execution-profile.local.toml` when present.
It may route only exact documented LCK invocations and cannot change reviewed
SHAs, findings, severity, verdict, or the read-only boundary.

## Prepare the exact review target

```bash
uv run --frozen python -m tools.lck review prepare <TASK>
```

Proceed only on `READY_FOR_SEMANTIC_REVIEW`. Use the returned `review_id`, current
Task Contract, locked target, effective diff, checks/formal-validation evidence,
`structured_review_instructions`, and sealed `review_root`. Do not replace these
facts with Delivery handoffs, archived evidence, expected SHAs, or direct GitHub
selection.

Review Prepare has already run formal validation for the exact head. Consume that
evidence; do not rerun pytest, Ruff, mypy, lock checks, Skill validators, or an
equivalent suite in the sealed clone. The source repository and the standalone
review clone are implementation-read-only except for the ignored operation evidence
owned by LCK.

## Inspect, reason, judge, and report

Follow all applicable `structured_review_instructions`. Read the complete effective
diff, test source, and necessary related code. Map every acceptance criterion to
evidence and inspect correctness, failure behavior, integration, public/config/docs
effects, test semantics, and applicable security or workflow boundaries. Expand to
comments, hierarchy, or history only for an explicit reference or concrete ambiguity.

Continue the full review after finding a blocker and perform the required residual
sweep. Findings use Blocking, High, Medium, Low, and Nit; any unresolved
Blocking/High/Medium defect or unmet requirement produces FAIL. If LCK evidence is
insufficient, report the specific validation/evidence gap instead of manufacturing
substitute authority. Provider or fresh-review-only proof is a Review-acceptance
evidence gap, not a retroactive Delivery requirement.

Independent Review never modifies implementation. It does not submit a GitHub
Review, repair code, write lifecycle state, merge, close the Issue, start Remediation,
perform Closeout, or assess Feature completion.

## Complete against fresh live state

For PASS:

```bash
uv run --frozen python -m tools.lck review complete <TASK> \
  --review-id <REVIEW_ID> \
  --verdict PASS
```

For FAIL, write complete blocking findings to an ignored or temporary file outside
the sealed clone, then run:

```bash
uv run --frozen python -m tools.lck review complete <TASK> \
  --review-id <REVIEW_ID> \
  --verdict FAIL \
  --findings-file <FINDINGS_FILE>
```

Review Complete reacquires live applicability. `REVIEW_STALE_HEAD`,
`REVIEW_STALE_BASE`, `REVIEW_STALE_TASK`, or `REVIEW_STALE_DIFF` rejects the verdict;
report the stale result and require a new fresh Review. A valid FAIL returns
`STOP_REQUIRED`; report `不通过，需要修复`, all findings, and the failed `review_id`,
then stop without starting Remediation.

Only after a valid PASS returns `READY_FOR_MERGE_PREFLIGHT`, run:

```bash
uv run --frozen python -m tools.lck merge preflight <TASK>
```

This fresh read-only gate verifies the accepted Review against the current PR,
head/base, required checks, blockers, and mergeability. Only
`READY_FOR_HUMAN_MERGE` permits the report `通过，可以人工合并`. Include reviewed
identity/diff, acceptance coverage, validation/check state, applicability, preflight,
findings, and limitations, then stop at the maintainer manual Squash Merge boundary.
