# Skill: Structure First

## Purpose

> **Primary Flow**: the top-down readable main path that orchestrates the logic

When generating, refactoring, or reviewing code, prioritize a **readable success path (Primary Flow)** first.
Keep boundaries minimal (only when needed), compose with **Atoms** (small units with one stable role and clear I/O), and secure stability through
**contract-driven tests** rather than implementation-following tests.

## Scope

- Use this skill for **real structure work on code**. For non-implementation tasks, use it only as an internal decision frame, not a response template.

## When to Use

- When code does not read naturally from top to bottom
- When function/module splitting becomes excessive and utilities start to spread
- When tests are drifting toward implementation-following patterns

## Do Not Use

- Throwaway experiments or one-off exploratory code
- Tiny changes where structural intervention would be excessive

## Priorities (Bias)

- Readable flow > structural simplicity > reusability > abstraction
- Prefer **clarity of the current code** over speculative future needs
- Splitting is not a goal; split only when it improves readability

## Scale Application

- Use the same principles at any scale.
- Treat each change as one pass in a larger restructuring effort, using one **current unit** as the focal unit.
- Local changes: function/file. Feature work: module/use case. Larger refactors: capability/subsystem.
- Make the Primary Flow readable at that unit, and keep parent/child fit in view when adjacent units move.
- At function/file scale, stay shallow.
- Still name a stage when multiple boundary phases start to mix in one flow.
- A good result often still reads like `normalize -> load -> decide -> return`.
- If branch narration starts depending on extra intermediate data structures or helper chains, keep more inline or stop descending.
- At capability/subsystem scale, name the entrypoint and main orchestrator.
- Make state and decision owners explicit so downstream units consume evaluated outcomes instead of recomputing policy or rewriting the same externally observable result through another path.

## Work Routine

1. **Fix Intent**

- State the intent of the change/code in one sentence.
- State the current unit before restructuring: function/file, module/use case, or capability/subsystem.

2. **Minimize Boundaries**

- Classify steps as I/O, domain decision, or transform.
- Do not add more boundaries than necessary.

3. **Primary Flow First**

- Make the success path readable in one top-down pass.
- Keep branches/exceptions from breaking the main flow (early return or push them downward).
- When flattening local branch logic, preserve whether rules are cumulative or precedence-ordered.

4. **Extract Atoms**

- Split when a Primary Flow sentence becomes clearer as a function or child unit.
- Atoms should do one stable job with clear I/O at the current unit.
- Prefer pure functions when possible.
- At function/file scale, stop when splitting no longer clarifies the local flow. Keep more inline or re-state the current unit before descending further.

5. **Single Composition Point**

- Keep orchestration in one place at the current unit.
- Minimize direct dependencies/calls between Atoms.

6. **Push Side Effects to Boundaries**

- Gather side effects (I/O, state mutation) at boundaries.
- Keep inner logic focused on computation and decisions.

7. **Align Read Order**

- At file level, default to: export/public -> orchestrator -> atoms -> utils for top-down discoverability.

8. **Control Growth**

- Start with the minimum public I/O/signature for the confirmed responsibility; grow it only when responsibility changes (new external input, mixed semantics, or boundary move).
- Default to one owner for each business decision/calculation rule and for each write path that affects the same externally observable result. If coordinating multiple writers is itself the responsibility, make that coordinator explicit.
- Async boundaries must have one owner for freshness and completion policy, including how freshness conflicts are resolved and how start/finish responsibility is balanced.
- If rule ownership changes or you introduce an equivalent new path, remove/disable the old one in the same change when possible. Otherwise include a staged migration plan (owner, exit condition).
- `Decision rule`: repeated predicate/weight/priority logic that decides behavior.
- `Equivalent path`: an alternative execution path that yields the same externally observable result.

## Test Guidance (Unit tests for Atoms)

- Write **sufficient tests at the most stable Atom level available** whenever possible.
- Validate **contracts (I/O, invariants, edge cases)** between the current unit and its Atoms/boundaries, not internals.
- If orchestration or boundary integration is where the risk lives, test the current unit directly.
- For async or stateful boundaries, test ownership contracts such as stale-result handling, balanced completion, and equivalent-input no-op at the most stable unit that owns them.
- If tests cannot be added in the current change, say so explicitly and name the next stable Atom(s) plus the required contract cases.
- Keep test code readable: use `each`/table cases to reduce duplication, allow only small helpers that do not blur structure, and keep each test focused on one core assertion.

## Stop Rules / Anti‑patterns

- If splitting increases argument/state passing, roll it back.
- Do not split functions/files for appearance only (avoid utility sprawl).
- If names start turning into long explanations, re-check boundaries.
- Avoid adding abstractions/layers for assumed future reuse.
- Avoid over-abstracted tests and helper sprawl.
- Do not add parameters "for later."
- Do not keep the same decision rule in multiple owner locations.
- Do not split the same externally observable result across multiple writer locations unless coordinating those writers is itself the explicit responsibility.
- Do not synchronously mirror upstream boundary state into local mutable state unless ownership and reset semantics are explicit.
- Do not create self-feedback loops where a unit reads from an input/update path and writes back into that same path.
- Do not keep new and legacy equivalent paths in parallel without a staged migration plan (owner, exit condition).

## Final Gates

- Can the success path be seen in one top-down read?
- Is the current unit stated clearly and still the right unit for this change?
- At function/file scale, is the flow still shallow enough without extra intermediate data structures or helper chains narrating the branches?
- Does splitting reflect real responsibility/boundary changes?
- Can each Atom's I/O be explained in one line?
- Are side effects concentrated at boundaries?
- Are tests contract-focused and concise?
- If decision rules moved, is one owner now explicit?
- At capability/subsystem scale, can you name the entrypoint, main orchestrator, and decision owners?
- If more structure work remains across units, is the next re-entry point clear before ending this pass?
- Are parameter growth and old-path handling (cleanup or staged migration) justified and complete?

## Completion Evidence

Use this format only when it materially helps explain structure work or a structure-focused review. It is not the default user-facing output.

When the format is useful, provide these four lines:

- `Current Unit:` function/file | module/use case | capability/subsystem
- `Primary Flow:` top-down in 3-6 lines
- `Boundaries:` list of I/O boundaries
- `Tests:` `added ...` or `deferred because ...; next stable Atom(s): ...; required contract cases: ...` (include freshness/completion contract when relevant)

For refactoring work where rule ownership changed, also provide:

- `Decision Ownership:` `rule -> owner unit`; duplicated owner removed? yes/no

For refactoring work where signatures/boundaries grew or an old path was replaced, also provide:

- `Refactor Check:` parameter growth reason / legacy path status (removed, disabled, migration plan)
