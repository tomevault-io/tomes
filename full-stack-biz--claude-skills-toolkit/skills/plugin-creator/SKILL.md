# Plugin Creator

**Dual purpose:** Create plugins from scratch OR transform existing projects into well-structured plugins.

## Quick Routing

Use AskUserQuestion with **predefined options** to gather requirements:

```
questions: [
  {
    question: "What would you like to do?",
    header: "Action",
    options: [
      {
        label: "Create a new plugin",
        description: "Build a plugin from scratch with proper manifest, structure, and components"
      },
      {
        label: "Convert a project to plugin",
        description: "Transform existing project into plugin with manifest and proper directory layout"
      },
      {
        label: "Validate a plugin",
        description: "Check plugin structure against Claude Code standards"
      },
      {
        label: "Publish to marketplace",
        description: "Prepare plugin for distribution and marketplace publication"
      }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }
]
```

Then proceed to the appropriate workflow section based on their selection.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke plugin-creator in these scenarios:

**Creating new plugins:** Building a plugin from scratch with proper manifest, commands, agents, Skills, hooks, and/or MCP servers organized correctly.

**Converting projects to plugins:** Take an existing project and transform it into a Claude Code plugin with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest and proper directory structure.

**Validating plugin structure:** Check existing plugins against Claude Code plugin standards (manifest schema, directory layout, naming conventions).

**Multi-component plugins:** Creating plugins that bundle multiple elements (Skills, hooks, agents, MCP servers, etc.).

**Team/production plugins:** Building plugins for distribution across teams or deployment to plugin marketplaces.

**NOT for:** General Claude questions, debugging plugin behavior at runtime, writing plugin code directly (focus on structure/organization only).

## ⚠️ Important: Slash Commands Deprecated

**Slash commands** (via `commands/` directory) are deprecated in favor of **Agent Skills**.

When creating new plugins, use Agent Skills (`skills/` directory) instead. Slash commands still work for backward compatibility but are being phased out. Use `skill-creator` to build Agent Skills instead.

---

## Foundation: How Plugins Work

Plugins extend Claude Code with custom functionality shared across projects and teams.

**Plugin activation:** Pure LLM reasoning on manifest metadata. Claude discovers plugins via:
- **name**: Unique identifier (plugin namespace)
- **description**: Tells Claude when to suggest or use the plugin

**Plugin structure (at project root):**
```
.
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json                    # Required: metadata manifest
├── skills/                            # Optional: Agent Skills (recommended)
│   └── code-review/
│       ├── SKILL.md
│       └── references/
├── agents/                            # Optional: subagents
│   ├── code-reviewer.md
│   └── security-auditor.md
├── hooks.json                         # Optional: event handlers
├── .mcp.json                          # Optional: MCP servers
├── .lsp.json                          # Optional: LSP servers
└── commands/                          # DEPRECATED: Use skills instead
    ├── hello.md
    └── review.md
```

**Token loading hierarchy:**
1. **Plugin manifest** (150 tokens): name + description in plugin.json (always loaded for discovery)
2. **Component metadata** (50-200 tokens each): Command files, agent descriptions, skill descriptions
3. **Full content** (unlimited): Loaded only when Claude uses the component

**Why this matters for your plugin:**
- **plugin.json description** is your activation signal (vague = plugin never recommended when needed)
- **Naming conventions** are critical (plugin name becomes skill namespace in plugins)
- **Directory structure** must be exact (Claude Code uses path conventions to discover components)
- **Component metadata** must be clear (descriptions tell Claude what each command/agent/skill does)

## Quick Start: Create a Plugin in an Empty Project

Copy-paste templates for creating a plugin structure from scratch: manifest, skills, agents, and testing. See `references/quick-start-guide.md` for complete bash commands and examples.

## Choose Your Workflow

**START HERE:** Always begin by asking the user to clarify their intent and collect all required manifest data using AskUserQuestion (one question at a time, progressive disclosure):

### Interview Flow for New Plugin Creation

For users creating a new plugin, conduct this structured interview to gather all manifest.json fields **before** file creation. Use the predefined options format shown in Quick Routing above for Step 1.

1. **Action** - Use the predefined options from "Quick Routing" section above
   - Create a new plugin (→ proceed to 2-9)
   - Convert a project (→ skip to Converting Projects section)
   - Validate a plugin (→ skip to Validating Plugins section)
   - Publish to marketplace (→ skip to Publishing to Marketplace section)

2. **Plugin name** - "What's the plugin name?" (lowercase-hyphen, 1-64 chars)
   - Maps to: `plugin.json` → `name` field
   - Example: `code-reviewer`, `pdf-processor`

3. **Purpose/description** - "What does the plugin do? Describe its main purpose and capabilities."
   - Maps to: `plugin.json` → `description` field (1-1024 chars)
   - Example: "Review code for best practices and potential issues."

4. **Version** - "What version? (semantic format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)"
   - Maps to: `plugin.json` → `version` field
   - Default if not specified: `1.0.0`

5. **Author information** - "Who is the author? (name, optional: email, URL)"
   - Maps to: `plugin.json` → `author` object with `name` field (REQUIRED)
   - Format: `{"name": "Your Name", "email": "optional@email.com", "url": "https://optional.url"}`
   - **CRITICAL:** author must be object, not string (common failure point)

6. **Optional metadata** - "Any additional metadata? (license, repository, homepage)"
   - Maps to: `plugin.json` → `license`, `repository`, `homepage` fields
   - Example: `"MIT"`, `"https://github.com/user/plugin"`, `"https://docs.example.com"`

7. **Components (BATCH 1)** - Use AskUserQuestion with **predefined options** (multiSelect: true):

```
questions: [
  {
    question: "Which core components will the plugin include?",
    header: "Core Components",
    options: [
      { label: "Skills", description: "Agent Skills (recommended)" },
      { label: "Agents", description: "Subagents for complex workflows" },
      { label: "Hooks", description: "Event handlers and automation" },
      { label: "MCP servers", description: "Model Context Protocol servers" }
    ],
    multiSelect: true
  }
]
```

8. **Components (BATCH 2)** - Then use AskUserQuestion for optional server support:

```
questions: [
  {
    question: "Include Language Server Protocol (LSP) support?",
    header: "LSP Servers",
    options: [
      { label: "Yes", description: "Add language-specific code intelligence" },
      { label: "No", description: "Skip LSP servers" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }
]
```

⏸️ Wait for both batch responses before proceeding.

9. **Distribution scope** - Use AskUserQuestion with **predefined options**:

```
questions: [
  {
    question: "What's the distribution scope for this plugin?",
    header: "Distribution",
    options: [
      { label: "Personal", description: "Personal use only" },
      { label: "Team-shared", description: "Share with team members" },
      { label: "Marketplace", description: "Publish to plugin marketplace for community" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }
]
```

### Manifest Field Mapping Reference

| Interview Question | Maps to | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Action | (routing logic) | string | Yes | Determines workflow path |
| Plugin name | `plugin.json` → `name` | string | Yes | kebab-case, 1-64 chars, no spaces |
| Purpose/description | `plugin.json` → `description` | string | Yes | 1-1024 chars, clear and specific |
| Version | `plugin.json` → `version` | string | No | Semantic versioning (default: 1.0.0) |
| Author name | `plugin.json` → `author.name` | string | Yes | Must be object property, not string |
| Author email | `plugin.json` → `author.email` | string | No | Optional contact information |
| Author URL | `plugin.json` → `author.url` | string | No | Optional profile/website |
| License | `plugin.json` → `license` | string | No | e.g., "MIT", "Apache-2.0" |
| Repository | `plugin.json` → `repository` | string | No | GitHub/GitLab URL |
| Homepage | `plugin.json` → `homepage` | string | No | Documentation URL |
| Components (BATCH 1) | Directory structure | array | No | Skills, Agents, Hooks, MCP servers (max 4 options) |
| Components (BATCH 2) | Directory structure | boolean | No | Include LSP servers (yes/no) |
| Distribution scope | `marketplace.json` | string | No | "personal", "team", or "marketplace" |

### Common Manifest Generation Failures (Prevention)

**Failure: `author` is string instead of object**
- ❌ Wrong: `"author": "John Doe"`
- ✅ Correct: `"author": {"name": "John Doe"}`
- **Prevention:** Always structure author as object in template

**Failure: Missing required fields**
- Check: `name`, `description`, `author.name` are always present
- Validate before writing plugin.json

**Failure: Incorrect marketplace.json schema**
- **Critical requirements:**
  - `owner` MUST be object: `{"name": "username"}`
  - `plugins` MUST be array: `[{...}]`
  - `source` MUST start with `./`
- See "Publishing to Marketplace" section for full schema

Based on their answers, route to the appropriate workflow section below:

## Automated Scanning Phase (For Validation)

**When validating existing plugins, always run the automated scanning phase FIRST before manual validation.**

See `references/automated-scanning-workflow.md` for complete scanning workflow, decision handling, and example validation sequences. The scanner is read-only only—it scans and reports, never modifies. All user decisions are explicit and visible.

**Quick reference:** Run the scanner, process errors/warnings, use AskUserQuestion for decisions, execute approved changes, re-scan, then proceed to manual validation.

---

### 1. Creating a New Plugin from Scratch
Interview requirements → create structure → add components → run `claude plugin validate` → test locally

See `references/implementation-workflow.md` for complete step-by-step procedures.

### 2. Converting an Existing Project to a Plugin
Identify components → create plugin structure → migrate and update metadata → run `claude plugin validate` → test locally

See `references/implementation-workflow.md` for complete step-by-step procedures.

### 3. Validating or Improving Existing Plugins
**FIRST:** Run `claude plugin validate /path/to/plugin` directly. Review output for errors. **THEN:** Do manual checks for best practices from `references/validation-checklist.md`.

### 4. Publishing to Marketplace

Make your plugin installable via `claude plugin marketplace add owner/repo`.

**Step 1:** Ensure plugin.json exists at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`

**Step 2:** Create `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with this structure:

```json
{
  "name": "your-plugin-name",
  "owner": {
    "name": "github-username-or-org"
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "your-plugin-name",
      "source": "./",
      "description": "What the plugin does"
    }
  ]
}
```

**CRITICAL schema requirements:**
- `owner` MUST be an object with `name` field, NOT a string
- `plugins` MUST be an array (can be empty `[]`)
- `source` paths MUST start with `./`

**Step 3:** Validate with `claude plugin validate /path/to/plugin`

See `references/team-marketplaces.md` for complete marketplace schema and common errors.

## Manifest Generation Best Practices

**BEFORE generating manifests, verify you have all required data:**

1. ✅ Plugin name (kebab-case, 1-64 chars)
2. ✅ Description (clear, 1-1024 chars)
3. ✅ Author name (will be in object: `{"name": "..."}`)
4. ✅ Version (semantic format, default: 1.0.0)

**ALWAYS structure author as object:**
```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "description": "What it does.",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": {
    "name": "Your Name"
  }
}
```

**NEVER generate with incomplete data** - Incomplete manifests cause validation failures. Run the interview flow first, collect all fields, then proceed with generation.

**For marketplace.json, use official schema:**
```json
{
  "name": "plugin-name",
  "owner": {
    "name": "github-username"
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "plugin-name",
      "source": "./",
      "description": "What it does"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Quick Start: 5-Minute Setup

**Create plugin directory:**
```bash
mkdir -p my-plugin/.claude-plugin
mkdir -p my-plugin/commands my-plugin/agents my-plugin/skills
```

**Write plugin.json:**
```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "description": "[Action]. [Brief description of purpose and capabilities].",
  "version": "1.0.3"
}
```

**Add components:**
- Agent Skills: `.md` files in `skills/` (recommended approach)
- Other components: See "Component Overview" section below
- Test: `claude --plugin-dir /path/to/my-plugin`

## Reference Guide

### Creating a New Plugin

**Step 1: Understand plugin architecture**
→ How plugins load, token costs, standard directory layout, manifest format
→ `references/plugin-architecture.md` for architecture overview
→ `references/directory-structure.md` for standard layout
→ `references/plugin-json-schema.md` for plugin.json format

**Step 2: Set up plugin structure & manifest**
→ Create `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with metadata (name, description, version)
→ Templates and common patterns for quick setup
→ `references/quick-reference.md` for templates and metadata requirements

**Step 3: Add Agent Skills, Hooks, or other components**
→ Agent Skills: recommended approach, `.md` files in `skills/`
→ Hooks: event handlers in `hooks.json`
→ Subagents: isolated execution in `agents/`
→ External services: MCP servers, LSP for code intelligence
→ `references/components-in-plugins.md` for packaging guidance
→ Use `skill-creator`, `subagent-creator`, or `hook-creator` skills to build components

**Step 4: Validate & test locally**
→ Run `claude plugin validate /path` for errors
→ Run `claude --plugin-dir /path` for local testing
→ Check best practices from validation checklist
→ `references/validation-checklist.md` for comprehensive checks
→ `references/local-development.md` for debugging

### Converting Existing Project to Plugin

→ Complete step-by-step procedures for converting projects to plugins
→ `references/implementation-workflow.md` for full conversion workflow
→ `references/automated-scanning-workflow.md` for scanning & validation phase

### Publishing & Distribution

→ Semantic versioning, changelog, marketplace setup
→ `references/versioning-and-distribution.md` for versioning
→ `references/team-marketplaces.md` for marketplace.json schema and multi-plugin registries

### Advanced Topics

**Path handling & caching:**
→ Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` variable in hooks/scripts. Plugins are cached for security.
→ `references/plugin-paths-variables.md` for path guidance
→ `references/plugin-caching.md` for caching behavior

**Installing & managing plugins:**
→ Installation scopes (global, project), CLI commands (install/uninstall/enable/disable/update)
→ `references/installation-and-cli.md` for scope and commands

**Troubleshooting & production:**
→ Debugging plugins, common issues, best practices, production checklist
→ `references/troubleshooting-and-production.md`

**Integration patterns:**
→ External service integration (MCP servers), language-specific intelligence (LSP)
→ `references/mcp-servers.md` for MCP configuration
→ `references/lsp-servers.md` for LSP integration

**Legacy support:**
→ Command file format (deprecated, for backward compatibility only)
→ `references/slash-command-format.md` for legacy command support

## Component Overview

See `references/quick-reference.md` for component templates, formats, and metadata requirements.

| Component | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| **Agent Skills** (`skills/`) | Capabilities Claude uses automatically or via `/skill-name` (recommended) |
| **Subagents** (`agents/`) | Isolated execution environments with custom prompts, tools, and permissions (use `subagent-creator` skill) |
| **Hooks** (`hooks.json`) | Event handlers (tool use, permissions, sessions) (use `hook-creator` skill) |
| **MCP Servers** (`.mcp.json`) | External service integration (APIs, databases) |
| **LSP Servers** (`.lsp.json`) | Language-specific code intelligence |
| **Commands** (`commands/`) | DEPRECATED: Use Agent Skills instead |

## Key Notes

**Plugin naming conventions:** Hyphen-separated lowercase (`code-reviewer`, `pdf-processor`, `test-runner`). Include action/domain; becomes plugin namespace `/plugin-name` for skills, commands, hooks.

**Description formula (Claude's activation signal):**
```
[Action]. [Brief description of purpose]. [Components/scope].
```
Example: "Review code for best practices and potential issues. Includes validate, report, and export commands."

**CLI commands:** `claude plugin install|uninstall|enable|disable|update <name>@<marketplace> [--scope user|project|local]`

**Important paths note:** Plugins are cached (not in-place) for security. Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` variable in hooks/scripts for paths. See `references/plugin-paths-variables.md` for details.

**Installation scopes:**
- **`user` (global)**: `~/.claude/skills/` (all projects)
- **`project` (shared)**: `.claude/skills/` (via git)
- **`local` (personal)**: `.claude/skills/` (not shared)
- **`managed` (read-only)**: System cache (marketplace plugins)

See `references/installation-and-cli.md` for scope and CLI details.

## Validation Checklist

**Step 0 (AUTOMATED SCANNING):** For existing plugins, run the automated scanner first to catch common issues:
```bash
bash /path/to/plugin-creator/scripts/scan-plugin.sh /path/to/plugin /tmp/plugin-scan.json
```
Review the JSON output and use AskUserQuestion to handle any decisions (file cleanup, permissions, etc.). See "Automated Scanning Phase" section above for details.

**Step 1 (REQUIRED):** Run the validation command directly:
```bash
claude plugin validate /path/to/plugin
```
Do NOT create wrapper scripts. Run this command directly and review its output.

**Step 2:** If validation passes, check best practices from `references/validation-checklist.md`:
- Manifest description includes specific trigger phrases
- Component metadata is clear and complete
- Security: No hardcoded secrets, safe shell patterns, proper permissions
- Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md present for distributed plugins
- Test locally with `claude --plugin-dir /path/to/plugin`
