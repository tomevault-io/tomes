# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Purpose

This repository is a **Claude Code plugin** that bundles reusable skills for creating skills and plugins. The plugin is named **skills-toolkit** and provides Agent Skills that can be auto-activated by Claude or invoked directly with `/skills-toolkit:skill-name` slash commands.

**CRITICAL MINDSET:** Skills are instructions FOR CLAUDE, not documentation FOR PEOPLE. When evaluating or improving a skill, the question is always: "Will this help Claude understand and execute the task?" not "Will people find this easy to read?"

**Plugin structure:** This project is organized as a Claude Code plugin with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest and `skills/` directory for Agent Skills. Skills control invocation behavior through frontmatter (see [Control who invokes a skill](#control-who-invokes-a-skill) below).

## Skill Structure

Each skill is a directory containing:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md                    # Required: metadata + instructions (frontmatter + body)
├── scripts/                    # Optional: executable code (Python, shell, etc.)
│   └── script.py
├── references/                 # Optional: documentation Claude loads into context
│   └── api.md
└── assets/                     # Optional: files used in output (images, templates)
    └── template.docx
```

### SKILL.md Format

SKILL.md is the complete instruction set Claude loads and follows when the skill is triggered.

**Frontmatter** (metadata Claude uses for skill discovery and activation):
```yaml
---
name: skill-name                    # lowercase, hyphens, ≤64 chars
description: >-                     # ≤1024 chars, specific trigger phrases
  What the skill does. Use when [trigger contexts/phrases].
version: 1.0.0                      # Optional: semantic version for tracking
allowed-tools: Read,Write,Bash(*)   # Optional: principle of least privilege
---
```

**Body** (instructions Claude executes):
- Clear, procedural guidance for the task
- Examples Claude can reference and adapt
- Important constraints and edge cases Claude must know
- Links to reference files for deeper context when needed
- Target <500 lines; offload detailed content to references/

**Key principle:** Every word in SKILL.md body is loaded when the skill triggers. Keep it focused on what Claude needs to execute the task correctly.

## Plugin Components

### Agent Skills (in `skills/`)
Skills are discoverable and invocable via both auto-activation and direct `/` commands:

- **skill-composer** - Create NEW Claude Code skills from scratch following best practices. Claude auto-activates when detecting skill creation tasks; users can invoke directly with `/skills-toolkit:skill-composer`.
- **skill-refiner** - Improve and validate EXISTING Claude Code skills for clarity, efficiency, and production readiness. Claude auto-activates when detecting skill refinement/validation tasks; users can invoke directly with `/skills-toolkit:skill-refiner`.
- **skill-tester** - Empirically test and benchmark skills using evaluation-driven development. Two modes: Quick Workflow (fast pass/fail) or Full Pipeline (baseline comparison, metrics, iteration tracking). Users can invoke with `/skills-toolkit:skill-tester`.
- **plugin-creator** - Create, convert, and validate Claude Code plugins. Claude auto-activates when detecting plugin-related tasks; users can invoke directly with `/skills-toolkit:plugin-creator`.
- **subagent-creator** - Create, validate, and refine Claude Code subagents. Claude auto-activates for subagent delegation tasks; users can invoke with `/skills-toolkit:subagent-creator`.
- **hook-creator** - Create, validate, and refine hooks for automating workflows. Claude auto-activates for hook-related work; users can invoke with `/skills-toolkit:hook-creator`.

No separate command files are needed—skills use frontmatter to control invocation behavior.

## Known Limitation: Knowledge Duplication & Future Refactoring

### Current State

This toolkit has intentional **knowledge duplication** that respects Claude's official architecture:

- `plugin-creator` includes summaries of skill/subagent/hook knowledge in `references/`
- These overlap with the full guidance in `skill-composer/`, `subagent-creator/`, and `hook-creator/`
- This duplication follows the **Bounded Scope Principle** (see `skills/skill-composer/references/self-containment-principle.md`)

**Why?** Claude's official architecture does not support skill-to-skill delegation as a first-class feature. Each skill must be completely self-contained within its directory structure. This is documented in [Claude Code Skills documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills).

### Future Improvement Path

When Claude implements full support for `context: fork` skill execution ([Feature request on GitHub](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/17283)), we can refactor for Single Responsibility Principle:

```yaml
# Future: When context: fork fully works for skills
---
name: plugin-creator
description: Create and organize plugins with proper structure
context: fork  # ← Delegate complex tasks to subagents
agent: general-purpose
---

# plugin-creator focuses on: manifest, directory layout, CLI
# Delegates to: skill-creator, subagent-creator, hook-creator for component knowledge
```

This will enable:
- Reduced duplication in `plugin-creator/references/`
- True Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Knowledge owned by one specialist (skill-composer owns skill knowledge)
- `plugin-creator` focuses solely on plugin structure

### What This Means

**For Users:**
- Current behavior unchanged: `/plugin-creator` works as-is
- Direct skill invocation works as-is
- No changes required to your usage

**For Contributors:**
- Don't try to eliminate duplication by sharing files (violates bounded scope)
- When updating skill knowledge, update both the specialist skill AND the summary in plugin-creator
- Watch for the Claude feature request resolution; we'll refactor when possible

**For Agents (You, Claude):**
- Bounded scope design is intentional, not a bug
- Duplication exists because the architecture demands it (for now)
- This will improve when Claude's skill delegation becomes stable

## Development Workflow

### Creating a New Skill

1. Create a directory: `skill-name/`
2. Create `SKILL.md` with frontmatter (name + description) and body (instructions)
3. Add `scripts/` if the skill includes reusable code
4. Add `references/` if instructions are lengthy (keep one level deep)
5. Add `assets/` only if outputting files users will interact with

### Testing Skills (Empirical Validation)

After creating a skill, test it empirically using **skill-tester**:

**Quick Workflow** (fast validation):
```bash
/skills-toolkit:skill-tester
# Select skill → Choose "Quick Workflow" → Create test cases → View pass/fail
```
Time: ~2-5 minutes. No baseline, just verify skill works.

**Full Pipeline** (comprehensive benchmarking):
```bash
/skills-toolkit:skill-tester
# Select skill → Choose "Full Pipeline" → Create test cases → See metrics
```
Time: ~5-15 minutes. Includes baseline comparison, token usage, timing deltas.

**Workflow**: Create → Test (Quick) → Refine → Test (Full) → Package

Results stored in `./evals/<skill-name>/workspace/iteration-N/` with `benchmark.json` for side-by-side comparison.

### Best Practices Reference

Consult [building-skills.md](building-skills.md) for comprehensive guidance on:
- Writing effective descriptions and trigger phrases
- Progressive disclosure of information
- Workflow patterns (checklists, feedback loops, templates)
- Security and permissions
- Testing and iteration
- Organization patterns by complexity

Key principle: **Context window = public good**. Every token must justify its cost through genuine value to Claude's task execution.

### Plugin Installation

This repository is a Claude Code plugin. Install it with:

```bash
claude plugin install . --scope project
# or
claude plugin install /path/to/skills-toolkit --scope project
```

**Testing locally before installation:**
```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/skills-toolkit
```

**Plugin structure:**
- **Manifest**: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - metadata (name, description, version)
- **Skills**: `skills/` - Agent Skills bundled in plugin (auto-discoverable with `/` command support)

## Skill Anatomy (Quick Reference)

| Component | Claude's Use | Required? |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| `SKILL.md` frontmatter | Discovery (name for reference) + activation (description triggers skill) | Yes |
| `SKILL.md` body | Core instructions Claude follows to execute the task | Yes |
| `scripts/` | Reusable code Claude may reference or invoke | No |
| `references/` | Additional context Claude loads on-demand (zero token penalty until needed) | No |
| `assets/` | Output files Claude produces (not loaded into context during execution) | No |

**Token loading hierarchy** (critical for efficiency):
1. **Frontmatter only** (~100 tokens) - always loaded for skill discovery
2. **SKILL.md body** (~1,500-5,000 tokens) - loaded when skill triggers
3. **References/scripts** (unlimited) - loaded only if Claude determines they're needed

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Thinking of skills as end-user documentation**
- Don't write for "readability by people"
- DO write for "Claude's task execution efficiency"
- Example: Don't spend tokens on friendly tone; spend them on clear procedures

❌ **Overloading SKILL.md body with comprehensive guides**
- Don't put 500+ lines of detailed reference in SKILL.md
- DO keep body <500 lines and link to reference files
- Example: Move detailed API docs → `references/api.md`

❌ **Vague or generic descriptions**
- Don't write: "Process files"
- DO write: "Process PDF files with OCR. Use when extracting text or analyzing documents. Supports encrypted PDFs."

❌ **Making design decisions based on how it "looks" or "reads"**
- Don't: "This reads better with an explanation"
- DO: "Will Claude understand this without the explanation?"

## Markdown Code Fence Escaping

When authoring skill examples that show code blocks within code blocks, use these techniques:

**One level of nesting** (code block containing code fence):
- Wrap with 4 backticks (`````) instead of 3
- Example: document JSON that contains a Markdown code block

**Two levels of nesting** (show code fence examples showing code fences):
- Alternate between backticks and tildes
- Outer: 4 backticks (````)
- Inner: 3 backticks (```)
- Wrap inner in tildes: `~~~`

**Arbitrary nesting** (3+ levels):
- Append invisible markers (Left-To-Right Mark, U+200E) to closing fences to differentiate them
- Or use increasing numbers of backticks/tildes

**Practical**: Most skill examples won't need deep nesting. Use 4 backticks for simple nested blocks and reference documentation in separate files for complex examples.

## Design Principles

1. **Conciseness** - Assume Claude's baseline intelligence; only document domain-specific knowledge
2. **Actionable first** - Lead with concrete examples and quick reference before theory
3. **Progressive disclosure** - Start with essentials, link to detailed sections
4. **Clear triggers** - Description determines if skill activates; be specific about when to use it
5. **Token accountability** - Every word in SKILL.md body must justify its presence for Claude's task execution

## Workflow: Adding a New Skill to the Plugin

1. Create skill in `skills/skill-name/`
2. Create `SKILL.md` with frontmatter (including `name`, `description`, and invocation controls) + instructions
3. Use frontmatter fields to control invocation:
   - Default: Both Claude auto-activation and `/` command invocation enabled
   - `disable-model-invocation: true` - Only users can invoke (e.g., for `/deploy`, `/commit`)
   - `user-invocable: false` - Only Claude can invoke (e.g., for background context skills)
4. Test locally: `claude --plugin-dir . /skills-toolkit:skill-name`
5. Install plugin: `claude plugin install .`

## Version Release Process

For detailed release process guidance, use the `/dev-flow:release-process` skill.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: When Any Skill Changes, Bump Plugin Version

When you update a skill/hook/subagent:
1. Update that component's version in its frontmatter/manifest
2. **ALWAYS also bump the plugin version** in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
3. Update **root CHANGELOG.md only** (never create skill-level changelogs)

Example:
- skill-creator 1.4.0 → 1.5.0 (MINOR)
- Plugin 1.12.0 → 1.13.0 (MINOR) ← **Must bump**
- Single entry in root CHANGELOG.md documenting the skill changes

### CRITICAL: Skill Versions Are Independent From Plugin Version

**⚠️ NEVER compare plugin version numbers to skill version numbers. They track different things.**

Each skill maintains its own independent semantic version (in `SKILL.md` frontmatter):

- **skill-composer**: 2.7.0
- **skill-refiner**: 1.4.0
- **skill-tester**: 1.1.0
- **plugin-creator**: 1.7.0
- **subagent-creator**: 1.4.0
- **hook-creator**: 2.4.0
- **Plugin**: 2.14.0

These are independent tracking systems, NOT a hierarchy.

**Skill version bumps** (happen to individual skills):
- PATCH: Bug fixes, wording improvements, reference updates to that specific skill
- MINOR: New capabilities or expanded tool access in that skill
- MAJOR: Breaking changes to that skill's behavior or interface

**Plugin version bumps** (happen to the whole plugin):
- PATCH: Any skill gets PATCH bump + plugin receives it
- MINOR: Any skill gets MINOR bump + plugin receives it (or skills added/removed)
- MAJOR: Any skill gets MAJOR bump + plugin receives it (or breaking plugin structure changes)

**Example workflow (correct):**
1. skill-composer changes detected → MINOR bump (2.6.0 → 2.7.0)
2. Plugin receives MINOR bump (2.13.0 → 2.14.0)
3. ✅ CORRECT: Plugin 2.14.0 reflects "one of my skills had a minor change"

**Example workflow (WRONG - never do this):**
1. skill-composer 2.7.0, hook-creator 2.4.0
2. "Plugin is 2.14.0 which is LESS than skill-composer's 2.7.0, so bump plugin to 2.7.0"
3. ❌ WRONG: Comparing version numbers across independent systems creates nonsense

### CHANGELOG Location Rule

**ALL changelog entries go in root `CHANGELOG.md` only.**

- ❌ Never create `skills/plugin-creator/CHANGELOG.md`
- ❌ Never create `skills/hook-creator/CHANGELOG.md`
- ✅ All releases documented in root `/CHANGELOG.md` with skill/hook/subagent prefixes

Format: `- **skill-name X.Y.Z:** Change description`

## Control who invokes a skill

Skills support frontmatter fields to control invocation behavior:

- **`disable-model-invocation: true`** - Only you can invoke via `/skill-name`. Use for workflows with side effects (e.g., `/deploy`, `/commit`, `/send-slack-message`). Prevents Claude from triggering these automatically.
- **`user-invocable: false`** - Only Claude can invoke. Use for background knowledge skills that shouldn't be directly actionable (e.g., a `legacy-system-context` skill that teaches Claude about old systems).
- **(default)** - Both you and Claude can invoke. Skill description always in context; Claude loads full skill when relevant.

## Auto-Memory (Persists Across Sessions)

This project uses Claude Code's auto-memory feature. Memory is stored in:
```
/Users/sergeymoiseev/.claude/projects/-Users-sergeymoiseev-full-stack-biz-claude-skills-toolkit/memory/
```

**MEMORY.md** contains:
- Critical workflows and patterns confirmed across multiple sessions
- User preferences (no commits without explicit request, etc.)
- Important architectural decisions
- Solutions to recurring problems

Check MEMORY.md at start of session for context that carries over.

## Notes for Future Development

- Plugin architecture established; follow `.claude-plugin/` conventions
- Skills are organized within plugin; use `skills/` directory for new additions
- Legacy `commands/` directory can be deprecated; use skill frontmatter instead
- Bounded scope design is intentional (knowledge duplication in components) — do not try to eliminate it
- All skills have independent versioning; never compare skill versions to plugin version
- Always update root CHANGELOG.md only; never create skill-level changelogs
