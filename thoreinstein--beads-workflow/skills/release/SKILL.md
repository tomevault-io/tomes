# Release Authoring

## Agent Delegation
You MUST delegate the coordination of release artifacts and stakeholder communication strategy to the `agile-delivery-lead` sub-agent. For technical verification of the release state, consult the `sre-engineer` if necessary.

## Workflow

### 1. Pre-flight Checks
- Ensure a clean working tree (`git status --porcelain`).
- Identify the last tag and review changes since then.

### 2. Semver Selection
Analyze commits since the last tag to determine the version bump (Major, Minor, or Patch) based on the highest-impact change.

### 3. Artifact Creation & Version Bumping
- **Identify Version Files**: Find files containing the current version (e.g., `package.json`, `gemini-extension.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`).
- **Update Versions**: Increment the version string in these files to the new selected version.
- **RELEASE_NOTES.md**: Prepend summary, breaking changes, new features, bug fixes, and operational notes.
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Prepend version header and bulleted list of commits.

### 4. Execution Sequence
1.  **Draft** release content.
2.  **Update** version in identified project files.
3.  **Write** release notes and changelog.
4.  **Stage** all changes (artifacts and version updates).
5.  **Commit** with GPG signature (`git commit -S`).
6.  **Tag** with GPG signature (`git tag -s`).

## Constraints

- **GPG Signing Required**: All commits and tags MUST be signed.
- **NO PUSH**: Never push to the remote. The user pushes manually after review.
- **No CI-skip**: Do not use CI-skip directives in commit messages.
- **Clean Tree**: Abort if the working tree is dirty.
