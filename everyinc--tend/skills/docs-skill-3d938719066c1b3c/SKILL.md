# Tend Feed Runner Skill

Use this skill when a Codex Desktop thread is connected to a local Tend feed.

## Contract

- Use the local `tend` binary and its JSON CLI.
- Use one Codex thread per feed.
- Always pass the local Codex `threadId` to feed/work operations.
- Treat the feed binding as ownership. Do not drain another feed unless explicitly using cross-feed work.
- List queued work before using Gmail, GitHub, Slack, browser, filesystem, or other local connectors.
- Claim work before acting on a queued instruction.
- For approved external mutations, call `tend cli action:verify` immediately before the connector mutation. If `work:claim` includes `operatorGuidance.userAuthorization.riskConfirmation`, that in-app receipt is the user's risk confirmation for the named recipients while the verified digest still matches.
- For approved email, use `fromAddress` only to select the authenticated account, set the complete RFC From header to the exact display-name-bearing `fromHeader`, and send only the other exact `emailDelivery` fields returned by `action:verify`. Read the delivered MIME and actual From header back, report the latter as `deliveredFromHeader`, and provide a matching `emailDeliveryReadback` through `--result-file`. Tend rejects a bare or wrong sender identity, text-only MIME, or changed delivery. Direct connector calls outside Tend are outside this gate.
- Complete, fail, block, retry, or cancel claimed work through `tend cli`.
- Refresh sources only after the queue is drained, unless the claimed work explicitly asks for collection.
- Read the prompt-safe On Your Mind context before collecting sources. Treat it as temporary
  relevance context, never evidence, policy, instruction, or authorization.

## Setup

1. Run `tend start`.
2. Open Tend in Codex Desktop's in-app browser.
3. Start one fresh Codex thread for each feed.
4. Run `tend setup codex --feed <feed-id>` and paste its complete output into that thread.
5. Bind the thread:

   ```sh
   tend cli feed:bind --feed <feed-id> --thread <thread-id>
   ```

6. Create or update one same-thread heartbeat automation that runs the feed.
7. Handle the feed once immediately.

## Normal Wake

A heartbeat may wake the thread automatically. The user may also activate it manually by opening or
waking this same thread and saying `go deal with the feed`.

1. Inspect the feed:

   ```sh
   tend cli inspect --feed <feed-id>
   ```

   The response includes `mindContext`. When it is fresh, use it in one of two explicit ways:
   `lens` may focus normal search, ranking, or framing; `research` may originate one bounded
   feed-relevant question when the configured sources allow it. Research answers must come from
   independently collected sources.

2. List work:

   ```sh
   tend cli work:list --feed <feed-id> --thread <thread-id>
   ```

3. If work exists, claim one item:

   ```sh
   tend cli work:claim --feed <feed-id> --thread <thread-id>
   ```

4. Read any `operatorGuidance` returned by `work:claim` and follow it as the required write-back sequence.
5. Use local connectors only for the claimed item.
6. Write results back through the relevant `tend cli` command.
7. For `sweep_rejudge`, run `sweep:rejudge` against the returned `operatorGuidance.visibleCardIds` before completing the work.
8. For source recollection, record source runs and a sweep batch with the claimed `--work` id, then upsert a card for every `review` or `routine_action` judgment before completing the work.
   Give each such judgment a stable `cardId` (for example `gmail-<threadId>`) and reuse it as the card id; run `sweep:status --feed <feed-id>` and complete only when it reports `ready`.
   Checkpoints recorded with `--work` only advance when `work:complete` succeeds; it is refused with the list of unpresented judgments otherwise, and a re-claim returns that list as `operatorGuidance.pendingPresentation`.
   If context influenced collection, include a file-backed `contextUse` on the relevant source run
   and pin the same update id to the sweep batch.
   A full Gmail sweep must begin with paginated `gmail_search_email_ids(query: "", label_ids:
   ["INBOX"])`. Its checkpoint's `inboxEnumeration.messages` must map every authoritative
   `messageId` to its direct-read `threadId`; every resulting conversation must then appear exactly
   once in `readThreadIds` or `carriedForwardThreadIds`. Search results alone never define the Inbox.
9. Repeat until `work:claim` returns idle.
10. If a meaningful sweep or refresh happened, ask whether to compound learnings.

## Completing Work

```sh
tend cli action:verify --feed <feed-id> --work <work-id> --token <token>
tend cli work:complete --feed <feed-id> --work <work-id> --token <token> --result-file <path>
```

When `work:claim` includes `completionCleanup`, the action click authorizes that predictable cleanup too. Perform it in the same workflow and provide the `postAction` receipt; do not require a separate Archive click. If the main action succeeds but cleanup fails, complete with cleanup status `blocked`; Tend preserves the successful action so cleanup can be retried without repeating it. Then use `work:reconcile-approved` with a completed cleanup receipt. Use `work:fail`, `work:block`, `work:retry`, or `work:cancel` when the main action itself does not succeed.

For email, the result file must also contain `emailDeliveryReadback`. Report the connector's actual
delivered From header as `deliveredFromHeader` plus its recipients, MIME parts, and attachment
metadata; retain the verified version, `fromAddress`, `fromHeader`, approval digest, and payload
digest, then add `source: "connector_readback"`, `providerMessageId`, and `readAt`. Never synthesize
this receipt from the proposed draft.
For a pre-gate v1 send whose provider receipt is already stored and only cleanup remains, do not
retry or resend. Read the same provider message and add its actual `deliveredFromHeader` to the v1
receipt passed to `work:reconcile-approved`; the provider id and old payload must remain exact.
Run `tend cli help` for the full command surface.
