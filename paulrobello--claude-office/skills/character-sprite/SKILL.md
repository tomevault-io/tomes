# Character Sprite Generator

Create complete, animated character sprite sheets for Claude Office Visualizer agents using Nano Banana MCP and ImageMagick.

## Project Context

Characters are office workers rendered in **retro 16-bit pixel art style**. Each character requires multiple animation sprite sheets for different actions and directions.

**Art Style**: Retro 16-bit pixel art (SNES/Genesis era), clean pixels, limited colors.

**CRITICAL - NO ANTI-ALIASING**: All sprites must have sharp, crisp pixel edges with NO anti-aliasing, NO smoothing, NO blending between pixels. Each pixel should be a solid color with hard edges. Anti-aliased sprites look blurry and muddy in the game.

**Character Constraints**:
- Max width: 60px (matches current agent radius × 2)
- Max height: 75px (25% taller than width allowed)
- Magenta (#FF00FF) chroma key background

## Sprite Sheet Technical Specifications

### CRITICAL: Grid Layout Requirements

The game engine parses sprite sheets by dividing the total image into a fixed grid. **All cells must be uniform with ZERO padding/spacing between them.**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  NO gaps, borders, or padding between cells. Cells are calculated as:       │
│  cell_width = sheet_width / columns                                          │
│  cell_height = sheet_height / rows                                           │
│  Frame at (col, row) starts at pixel (col × cell_width, row × cell_height)  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**DO NOT:**
- Add visible grid lines or cell borders
- Add padding or spacing between cells
- Use inconsistent cell sizes
- Leave empty cells (fill with magenta background)

### Sheet Dimensions & Frame Specifications

| Sheet Type | Total Size | Grid | Cell Size | Frames |
|------------|------------|------|-----------|--------|
| **Idle** | 928 × 1152 px | 8 cols × 8 rows | 116 × 144 px | 64 total |
| **Walking** | 928 × 1152 px | 8 cols × 8 rows | 116 × 144 px | 64 total |
| **Typing** | 928 × 144 px | 8 cols × 1 row | 116 × 144 px | 8 frames |
| **Handoff** | 928 × 1152 px | 4 cols × 1 row | 232 × 411 px* | 4 frames |
| **Coffee** | 928 × 1152 px | 4 cols × 1 row | 232 × 699 px* | 4 frames |

*Handoff/coffee sheets have content offset - see Frame Location Map below.

### Frame Location Map

**Grid Sheets (Idle/Walk) - 8 columns × 8 rows:**
```
Row 0 (y=0-143):    South (front-facing)     - Frames 0-7 at x: 0, 116, 232, 348, 464, 580, 696, 812
Row 1 (y=144-287):  South-West               - Frames 0-7
Row 2 (y=288-431):  West (left profile)      - Frames 0-7
Row 3 (y=432-575):  North-West               - Frames 0-7
Row 4 (y=576-719):  North (back view)        - Frames 0-7
Row 5 (y=720-863):  North-East               - Frames 0-7
Row 6 (y=864-1007): East (right profile)     - Frames 0-7
Row 7 (y=1008-1151): South-East              - Frames 0-7
```

**Strip Sheets (Single row):**
```
Typing:  Row 0, 8 frames at x: 0, 116, 232, 348, 464, 580, 696, 812 (y=0-143)
Handoff: Row 0, 4 frames at x: 0, 232, 464, 696 (content y=343-753)
Coffee:  Row 0, 4 frames at x: 0, 232, 464, 696 (content y=0-698)
```

### Animation Requirements

| Animation | Frames | Duration | Looped | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|-------|
| **Idle** | 8 frames × 8 directions | 2000ms | Yes | Subtle breathing/weight shift |
| **Walking** | 8 frames × 8 directions | 800ms | Yes | Full walk cycle with arm swing |
| **Typing** | 8 frames | 400ms | Yes | Back view, hands on keyboard |
| **Handoff** | 4 frames | 600ms | No | Side view, handing folder |
| **Coffee** | 4 frames | 400ms | Yes | Front view, drinking motion |

**8 Directions** (row order): S, SW, W, NW, N, NE, E, SE

## Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Base Character Design

Create a front-facing idle pose to establish the character's look:

```bash
mcpl call nanobanana generate_image '{
  "prompt": "16-bit pixel art game sprite of a [CHARACTER DESCRIPTION], front view facing camera, [CLOTHING DESCRIPTION], simple friendly face, small character suitable for top-down office game, retro SNES/Genesis style pixel art, standing idle pose with arms at sides, isolated on solid magenta background #FF00FF, SHARP CRISP PIXEL EDGES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO ANTI-ALIASING NO SMOOTHING NO BLENDING, each pixel is a solid color with hard edges, centered composition, no text, no shadows on background, 64x80 pixels scale",
  "output_path": "/Users/probello/Repos/claude-office/frontend/public/sprites/[NAME]_front_idle_raw.png",
  "model_tier": "pro"
}'
```

**Prompt Variables:**
- `[CHARACTER DESCRIPTION]`: e.g., "male office worker", "female developer", "robot assistant"
- `[CLOTHING DESCRIPTION]`: e.g., "wearing blue dress shirt and tie, brown pants, black shoes, short brown hair"
- `[NAME]`: Character identifier (e.g., "agent1", "agent2", "boss")

### Step 2: VALIDATE AND ITERATE

**CRITICAL**: Get user approval before generating all sprite sheets.

1. Copy the generated image:
   ```bash
   cp "/Users/probello/nanobanana-images/[FILENAME].png" \
      "/Users/probello/Repos/claude-office/frontend/public/sprites/[NAME]_front_idle_raw.png"
   ```

2. View the image using the Read tool and present to user

3. Ask user to validate:
   - Character design matches their vision
   - Art style is correct (16-bit pixel art)
   - Proportions work for the game
   - Colors and details are acceptable

4. **If rejected**: Regenerate with adjusted prompt based on feedback

5. **If approved**: Proceed to Step 3

### Step 3: Generate All Sprite Sheets

Use BOTH reference images for each generation:
- **Reference 1**: The approved character design (for consistent appearance)
- **Reference 2**: Existing Agent #1 sprite sheet (for consistent frame layout)

}'
```

### Step 4: Validate Each Generated Sheet

**CRITICAL**: After generating each sprite sheet:

1. Copy to sprites folder:
   ```bash
   cp "/Users/probello/nanobanana-images/[FILENAME].png" \
      "/Users/probello/Repos/claude-office/frontend/public/sprites/[NAME]_[TYPE]_sheet_raw.png"
   ```

2. Verify dimensions match specifications:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/probello/Repos/claude-office/frontend/public/sprites

   # Check sheet dimensions
   magick "[NAME]_[TYPE]_sheet_raw.png" -format "Size: %wx%h" info:

   # Expected dimensions:
   # idle/walk sheets: 928x1152
   # typing sheet: 928x144 (after cropping) or 928x1152 (full generation)
   # handoff/coffee sheets: 928x1152
   ```

3. View using Read tool to verify:
   - Character matches approved design
   - All frames are present and properly arranged
   - Animation progression looks correct
   - Magenta background is solid
   - **NO visible grid lines or cell borders**
   - **NO padding/spacing between cells**
   - **SHARP pixel edges with NO anti-aliasing** (zoom in to check)
   - **For directional sheets (idle/walk)**: Verify direction order is correct:
     - Row 0: South (facing camera)
     - Row 1: South-West
     - Row 2: West (left profile)
     - Row 3: North-West
     - Row 4: North (back view)
     - Row 5: North-East
     - Row 6: East (right profile)
     - Row 7: South-East

4. Check for common issues:
   - If grid lines visible: Regenerate with stronger "no grid lines" emphasis
   - If wrong cell count: Regenerate with correct column/row specification
   - If inconsistent cell sizes: Regenerate with exact pixel dimensions in prompt
   - **If edges look soft/blurry (anti-aliased)**: Regenerate with stronger "NO ANTI-ALIASING" emphasis
   - **If directions are in wrong order**: Regenerate with explicit "ROW 0 south, ROW 1 south-west..." sequence

5. If issues found, regenerate that specific sheet

### Step 5: Process All Sprite Sheets

Remove magenta backgrounds from all sheets using the improved multi-pass workflow:

```bash
cd /Users/probello/Repos/claude-office/frontend/public/sprites

# Process all sheets using the shared script
SCRIPT="/Users/probello/Repos/claude-office/.claude/skills/shared/scripts/remove_magenta.sh"

for sheet in [NAME]_idle_sheet [NAME]_walk_sheet [NAME]_typing_sheet [NAME]_handoff_sheet [NAME]_coffee_sheet; do
  INPUT="${sheet}_raw.png"
  OUTPUT="${sheet}.png"

  # Use multi-pass removal (--skip-trim preserves sprite sheet dimensions)
  "$SCRIPT" "$INPUT" "$OUTPUT" --skip-trim

  echo "Processed: $OUTPUT"
  magick "$OUTPUT" -format "  Size: %wx%h, Opaque: %[opaque]" info:
done
```

The multi-pass workflow:
1. **FFmpeg geq filter**: Removes pixels where R≈B and G is low (purple/magenta hues)
2. **ImageMagick multi-pass**: Catches remaining bright magenta shades
3. **ImageMagick dark purple cleanup**: Removes dark edge pixels like rgb(32,0,31)

Also process the base character sprite:
```bash
INPUT="[NAME]_front_idle_raw.png"
OUTPUT="[NAME]_front_idle.png"

"$SCRIPT" "$INPUT" "$OUTPUT"
```

**Fallback** (if script unavailable):
```bash
magick "$INPUT" \
  -fuzz 40% -transparent "#FF00FF" \
  -fuzz 15% -transparent "#CC00CC" \
  -fuzz 15% -transparent "#880088" \
  -strip \
  "$OUTPUT"
```

### Step 6: Final Verification

View each processed sprite sheet to confirm:
- **NO pink/magenta fringing** around character edges (zoom in to check)
- Clean transparency throughout
- Character edges intact (not eroded by transparency removal)
- All frames visible

**If pink edges remain after processing:**
1. Try increasing fuzz value: `-fuzz 45%` or `-fuzz 50%` (but watch for character edge erosion above 50%)
2. If that erodes character edges, reduce fuzz and manually check the raw image
3. Raw images with anti-aliased edges against magenta will always have fringing issues - regenerate the raw image with stronger "NO ANTI-ALIASING" emphasis

## Reference Sprite Sheets

The following Agent #1 sprite sheets serve as layout references:

| Sheet | Location |
|-------|----------|
| Idle | `/frontend/public/sprites/agent1_idle_sheet.png` |
| Walking | `/frontend/public/sprites/agent1_walk_sheet.png` |
| Typing | `/frontend/public/sprites/agent1_typing_sheet.png` |
| Handoff | `/frontend/public/sprites/agent1_handoff_sheet.png` |
| Coffee | `/frontend/public/sprites/agent1_coffee_sheet.png` |

## Output Location

All sprites go to: `/Users/probello/Repos/claude-office/frontend/public/sprites/`

- `[name]_front_idle_raw.png` - Original character design (keep as reference)
- `[name]_front_idle.png` - Processed character design with transparency
- `[name]_[type]_sheet_raw.png` - Raw sprite sheets (keep as backup)
- `[name]_[type]_sheet.png` - Processed sprite sheets ready for game

## Character Ideas

Example character descriptions for variety:

| Character | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Agent 2 | Female developer with purple blouse, black pants, glasses, ponytail |
| Agent 3 | Male senior dev with gray sweater, khakis, beard, receding hairline |
| Agent 4 | Non-binary intern with green hoodie, jeans, colorful hair |
| Boss/Claude | Distinguished figure with orange/tan color scheme (matches Claude branding) |

## Anti-Patterns & Common Issues

### Grid Layout Issues (CRITICAL)

**DO NOT:**
- Add visible grid lines or borders between cells
- Add padding/margin/spacing between cells
- Generate sheets with inconsistent cell sizes
- Use wrong row/column counts (must be 8×8 for grid sheets, see specs above)
- Include desk, chair, keyboard in typing sprites (they're separate game assets)

**Common Generation Mistakes to Reject:**
- Grid lines visible between cells → regenerate with emphasis on "no grid lines"
- Cells have varying sizes → regenerate with exact pixel dimensions
- Empty/missing cells → regenerate with all cells filled
- Character includes furniture → regenerate with "CHARACTER ONLY" emphasis

### Anti-Aliasing Issues (CRITICAL)

**DO NOT:**
- Accept sprites with soft/blurry edges
- Accept sprites with color blending between pixels
- Accept sprites with smooth gradients at edges

**How to Detect Anti-Aliasing:**
- Zoom in on character edges - each pixel should be a single solid color
- Look for "halo" or "fringe" colors around the character outline
- Check if edges look smooth instead of jagged/stepped

**Common Anti-Aliasing Mistakes to Reject:**
- Soft edges around character outline → regenerate with stronger "NO ANTI-ALIASING" emphasis
- Color gradients at pixel boundaries → regenerate, emphasize "each pixel is a solid color"
- Blurry/muddy appearance → regenerate with "SHARP CRISP PIXEL EDGES"

### Workflow Anti-Patterns

**DO NOT:**
- Skip the initial design approval - iterate until user is happy
- Generate sprite sheets without both reference images
- Skip validation of each generated sheet
- Use flood-fill for background removal (use `-transparent` for sprite sheets)
- Proceed with inconsistent character designs across sheets

**DO:**
- Always get user approval on base design first
- Use character reference + layout reference for each sheet
- Validate each sheet after generation before proceeding
- Keep raw images as backup
- Process all sheets in batch after validation complete
- Verify cell dimensions match specs after generation
