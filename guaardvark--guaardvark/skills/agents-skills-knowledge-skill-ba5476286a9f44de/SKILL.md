# Knowledge with Guaardvark (MCP tools)

Everything here is the `guaardvark` MCP server. All retrieval is local (Ollama embeddings,
hybrid search, cross-encoder reranking on the user's GPU).

## Find and read

| tool | use |
|---|---|
| `search_knowledge_base` | the question in plain words; returns passages with sources. Cite them. |
| `summarize_corpus` | what the whole knowledge base covers, before searching blind |
| `list_documents` | which documents are indexed and how many passages each has |
| `get_document_outline` | sections or pages of one document, in order |
| `read_document_section` | the actual text of one section or page, no search |
| `process_file` | extract content from a PDF, DOCX, CSV, Excel, image or other file the user names |
| `fetch_url` | title, description and main text of one web page |
| `web_search` | DuckDuckGo results (titles, snippets, URLs) when the answer is not local |

Pattern: `summarize_corpus` or `list_documents` → `search_knowledge_base` → read the exact
section with `get_document_outline` + `read_document_section` before quoting.

## Remember

- `save_memory`: a fact, preference or instruction to keep across sessions. Use when the user says
  "remember", or states a durable preference. One fact per call.
- `search_memory`: check before assuming; recalled memories are what was true when saved.
- Forgetting: `delete_memory` is not exposed by this server by default, because it deletes. Find the
  memory with `search_memory`, then delete it with `DELETE /api/memory/<id>` on the backend. An
  operator who wants the tool over MCP adds `delete_memory` to `server.tools.allow` in
  `data/config/mcp.json`.

## Rules

- Quote the source (document name and section) for any claim that came from retrieval.
- If retrieval returns nothing, say so; do not fill the gap from general knowledge without
  labelling it.
- Indexing new folders happens in the Studio's Library page; the MCP server reads what is indexed.
