## API Changes

This section documents version-specific API changes — prioritize recent major/minor releases.

- BREAKING: ESM-only — `@vueuse/motion` v3.0.0 dropped CommonJS (CJS) support, the package is now ESM-only [source](./references/releases/v3.0.0.md)

- NEW: VueUse v13 support — updated dependencies to support the latest VueUse features in v3.0.0 [source](./references/releases/v3.0.0.md)

- NEW: `<Motion>` component — declarative component for animations, offering better SSR and MDC support since v2.2.0 [source](./references/releases/v2.2.0.md)

- NEW: `<MotionGroup>` component — renderless component introduced in v2.2.0 to apply motion configurations to all child elements [source](./references/releases/v2.2.0.md)

- NEW: `duration` and `delay` shorthand props — support for setting transition timing directly on elements/components since v2.2.0 [source](./references/releases/v2.2.0.md)

- BREAKING: Drop Vue 2 support — v2.0.0 and above exclusively support Vue 3 [source](./references/releases/v2.0.0.md)

- NEW: Full SSR support — significantly improved server-side rendering compatibility for both components and directives in v2.0.0 [source](./references/issues/issue-81.md)

- NEW: kebab-case directive support — `v-motion-initial` and other directive variants now support kebab-case since v2.1.0 [source](./references/releases/v2.1.0.md)

- NEW: `useMotionFeatures` export — this composable is now exported for manual feature registration since v2.2.6 [source](./references/releases/v2.2.6.md)

- NEW: `useMotion` dynamic keys — support for dynamic variant keys when calling `.apply()` and other methods since v2.1.0 [source](./references/releases/v2.1.0.md)

- NEW: `reactive-style` and `reactive-transform` — specialized composables for direct style and transform manipulation since v2.0.0 [source](./references/releases/v2.0.0.md)

- NEW: `MotionPlugin` types — enhanced TypeScript definitions for the main Vue plugin in v2.2.5 [source](./references/releases/v2.2.5.md)

- BREAKING: `onComplete` triggers — fixed in v2.2.0 to trigger after each property animation completes instead of only once [source](./references/releases/v2.2.0.md)

- NEW: `unref` directive bindings — directives now unref initial bindings, supporting refs within objects since v2.0.0 [source](./references/releases/v2.0.0.md)

**Also changed:** `visibilityOnce` variant new v2.0.0 · `useSpring` documentation update v2.2.0 · `preset` mutation fix v2.2.0 · `useMotions` dynamic keys v2.1.0 · `useMotionVariants` internal updates v2.0.0

## Best Practices

- Avoid deconstructing `useMotions()` at the top level of `setup` because properties are registered after the script execution; access them via the returned object within methods or hooks to ensure reactivity [source](./references/issues/issue-109.md)

```ts
// Preferred
const motions = useMotions()
const play = () => motions.myElement?.variant.value = 'play'

// Avoid
const { myElement } = useMotions()
```

- Use camelCase for visibility variants in Nuxt 3 templates (e.g., `visibleOnce`) rather than kebab-case (`visible-once`) to ensure proper directive resolution and avoid warnings [source](./references/issues/issue-108.md)

- Prefer the `<Motion>` component over the `v-motion` directive for projects requiring robust SSR, as it handles initial state style injection more reliably for SEO and UX [source](./references/docs/content/2.features/7.components.md)

- Define custom directives in the `MotionPlugin` configuration to create reusable animation presets that can be applied consistently via `v-motion-[name]` across the application [source](./references/docs/content/2.features/1.directive-usage.md)

- Use `<MotionGroup>` to apply a single animation configuration or preset to multiple child elements, significantly reducing template boilerplate and improving maintainability [source](./references/docs/content/2.features/7.components.md)

- Map the `leave` helper from the motion instance to the Vue `<transition>` element's `@leave` event to perform manual and synchronized exit animations on elements [source](./references/docs/content/2.features/5.variants.md)

```ts
const { leave } = useMotion(target, { leave: { opacity: 0 } })

// In template
// <transition @leave="(el, done) => leave(done)">
```

- Always specify an `initial` variant containing all properties that will be animated to prevent unexpected layout shifts and ensure smooth transitions from a known base state [source](./references/docs/content/2.features/5.variants.md)

- Utilize `useSpring` with `useMotionProperties` for high-performance, frame-rate independent animations that require physical continuity, such as for interactive gestures [source](./references/docs/content/3.api/2.use-spring.md)

- In Nuxt applications, use `runtimeConfig.public.motion.directives` to define global custom directives, ensuring they are properly initialized during both client and server rendering [source](./references/docs/content/1.getting-started/2.nuxt.md)

- Pass a reactive reference as the `target` to `useMotion` to allow the motion instance to automatically track and apply the current variant to new elements as they are updated [source](./references/docs/content/3.api/1.use-motion.md)
