name: sync-translations
description: Keeps all translation files in messages/ in sync. Use this skill whenever new UI text is added to the codebase, a translation key is missing in one language, or the wording of an existing translation changes. Detects missing keys, stale translations, and structural drift between language files. Use when this capability is needed.

Synchronize all translation files in `messages/` so every language contains the same keys with correct, natural translations.

## Project i18n Setup

- **Library:** `next-intl`
- **Source of truth for structure:** `messages/de.json` (German, default locale)
- **All locales:** defined in `src/i18n/config.ts` → currently `['de', 'en']`
- **Message files:** `messages/<locale>.json` — one per locale, flat namespace objects
- **Usage in code:** `useTranslations('<namespace>')` / `getTranslations('<namespace>')`, then `t('key')`

## Your Task

When invoked, work through the following steps in order.

---

### Step 1 — Read everything relevant

1. Read `src/i18n/config.ts` to get the current list of locales.
2. Read every file in `messages/` (one per locale).
3. Scan the entire `src/` directory for translation key usage:
   - Find all `useTranslations('namespace')` and `getTranslations('namespace')` calls
   - Find all `t('key')`, `t('namespace.key')`, and `t('key', {...})` call patterns
   - Focus on `.tsx`, `.ts` files under `src/`

---

### Step 2 — Identify what needs to change

Check for **four types of issues**:

#### A) Missing keys
A key exists in one language file but not in another.
- **Reference language:** `de.json` (German is the source of truth for structure)
- List every key path (e.g. `dashboard.noTransactions`) that is present in `de.json` but absent from another locale.
- Also check the reverse: keys in non-German files that don't exist in `de.json` are orphaned and should be noted but NOT automatically deleted — report them for manual review.

#### B) Keys used in code but missing from ALL message files
A `t('key')` call references a key that doesn't exist in any `messages/` file.
- These are newly added UI strings that haven't been translated yet.
- They need to be added to every locale.

#### C) Structural drift
The JSON structure (nesting, namespace names) differs between files.
- Example: `de.json` has `{ "expenses": { "title": "..." } }` but `en.json` has `"expensesTitle": "..."` at the top level.
- Flag these — do not silently restructure without reporting.

#### D) Explicitly changed wording (only when invoked after a specific change)
If the user describes a text change (e.g. "I updated the label for X"), identify the affected key and update all other locales to match the new meaning.

### Step 3 — Plan before editing

Write out a concise change plan before touching any file. Group by locale and type:

```
de.json  — no changes needed (reference)
en.json  — ADD 3 keys:
             expenses.filterByCategory  (missing)
             analytics.forecastTitle    (missing)
             settings.resetConfirm      (missing)
         — NOTE: orphaned key 'dashboard.chartPlaceholder' exists only in en.json
```

If no changes are needed, state that clearly and stop.

---

### Step 4 — Edit the message files

Apply every planned addition or correction.

**Translation quality rules:**
- Translations must be natural, idiomatic, and context-aware — not word-for-word.
- **German (de):** formal enough for a finance app, but approachable. Use "du" forms unless the existing file uses "Sie". Check the existing tone before adding new strings.
- **English (en):** concise, professional. Match the register of existing English strings.
- For financial/accounting terms use the standard terminology of the target language (e.g. "Girokonto" not "Gehaltskonto", "Savings Account" not "Saving Account").
- Preserve all interpolation placeholders exactly: `{count}`, `{name}`, `{amount}` must appear unchanged in every locale.
- Preserve ICU message syntax for plurals and selects if used.
- Keep key order inside each namespace consistent with `de.json` — new keys go at the bottom of their namespace.

**File format rules:**
- Valid JSON only — no trailing commas, no comments.
- Same indentation as the existing file (2 spaces).
- Do not reformat or reorder existing keys — only add or correct.

---

### Step 5 — Check for new locales

After syncing, re-read `src/i18n/config.ts`. If a new locale was added that has no file in `messages/` yet, create the full `messages/<locale>.json` by translating every key from `de.json`. Apply the same translation quality rules.

---

### Step 6 — Verify

After all edits, confirm:

- [ ] Every key present in `de.json` exists in all other locale files
- [ ] No interpolation placeholder (`{...}`) is missing or renamed in any translation
- [ ] All files are valid JSON (balanced braces, no trailing commas)
- [ ] No key used in `src/` code is missing from any `messages/` file
- [ ] No existing key was accidentally deleted or reordered

Report the checklist result. List any orphaned keys (present in non-German files but not in `de.json`) separately as items for manual review — do not delete them automatically.
