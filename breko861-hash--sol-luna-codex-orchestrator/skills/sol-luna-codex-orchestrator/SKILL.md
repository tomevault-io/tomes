# Delegate Work

Use this skill only when implementation should be handed to a worker.

If Astra is the active parent:
1. Pick the cheapest worker likely to finish the bounded task reliably:
   - Spark for tiny deterministic edits when available.
   - Luna High for normal implementation.
   - Sol Medium for harder bounded debugging, investigation or implementation.
2. Give the worker one clear outcome and only the context it needs.
3. Define what completion looks like and what verification is actually useful.
4. If the worker fails, check task clarity before escalating. Do not loop blindly.

If Sol is the active parent:
- use Spark or Luna when delegation clearly saves context, time or cost;
- otherwise handle the bounded work directly;
- do not spawn `sol-escalation` merely to recreate the active Sol parent.

For the detailed work-package template, read `references/work-package.md` only when you need to prepare the package.
