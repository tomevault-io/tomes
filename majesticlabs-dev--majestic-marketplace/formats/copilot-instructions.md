# Majestic Marketplace

Claude Code plugin marketplace. **Work in `plugins/*/` only.**

**Quick Nav:** [Forbidden](#forbidden) · [Structure](#structure) · [Dependencies](#dependencies) · [Docs](#documentation) · [Search](#codebase-search-qmd) · [Rules](#key-rules) · [Release](#plugin-release-checklist)

## FORBIDDEN

NEVER modify `~/.claude/`. All plugin work goes in `majestic-marketplace/plugins/`.

## Git Merge Operations

- NEVER merge branches to master without explicit user approval
- Always ask: "Ready to merge to master?" or create a PR for review
- Merging to production is irreversible - requires conscious decision

## Structure

```
plugins/{engineer,rails,python,react,marketing,sales,company,llm,tools,devops,experts}/
```

**Wiki repo**: `../majestic-marketplace.wiki/` (separate git repo, requires separate commit/push)

## Dependencies

| Plugin | Can Reference |
|--------|--------------|
| `engineer` | rails, python, react, llm, tools |
| `rails`, `python`, `react` | engineer |
| `marketing`, `sales`, `company`, `llm`, `tools`, `devops`, `experts` | (none) |

## Documentation

- [Naming](docs/plugin-architecture/NAMING-CONVENTIONS.md)
- [Operations](docs/plugin-architecture/PLUGIN-OPERATIONS.md)
- [Schemas](docs/plugin-architecture/JSON-SCHEMAS.md)
- [Config](docs/plugin-architecture/CONFIG-SYSTEM.md)

## Codebase Search (qmd)

Use `qmd` to search indexed plugin docs, skills, agents, and architecture files (622 markdown files). Always add `--json` for structured output.

| Need | Command |
|------|---------|
| Exact keyword | `qmd search "blueprint workflow" --json` |
| Conceptual/semantic | `qmd vsearch "how does task tracking work" --json` |
| Complex question | `qmd query "agent vs skill pattern" --json` |
| Read a doc | `qmd get path/to/file.md --json` |
| Batch read | `qmd multi-get "plugins/engineer/agents/**/*.md" --json` |

- Collection: `majestic-marketplace` (restrict with `-c majestic-marketplace`)
- Prefer `search` for known terms, `vsearch` for fuzzy/conceptual, `query` for best quality
- Use before Glob/Grep when searching across plugin documentation or skill content
- Re-index after major changes: `qmd collection remove majestic-marketplace && qmd collection add . --name majestic-marketplace && qmd embed`

## Config Access

```
VARIABLE = config_read("field", "default")
```

`config_read(field, default)` is pseudocode for invoking the `config-reader` skill (reads `.agents.yml` with `.agents.local.yml` overrides, supports dot notation for nested fields).

## Key Rules

### Limits
- Skills: <500 lines
- Agents: <300 lines

### Step Numbering Conventions

**Apply on first draft, not after correction.**

| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `1, 2, 3...` | Main sequential steps | Step 1, Step 2, Step 3 |
| `1.1, 1.2` | Substeps or alternatives under a parent | Step 1.1, Step 1.2, Step 1.3 |

**Rules:**
- Start numbering at 1, never 0
- Prefer adding new main steps over decimals (renumber if needed)
- Never use: `0A`, `8.5`, `Step 0`, letter suffixes, `2.5`

### File Locations
- Skill references → `skills/*/references/`
- Skill assets → `skills/*/assets/`
- Skill scripts → `skills/*/scripts/`
- Agent resources → `agents/**/resources/{agent-name}/`
- Command resources → `commands/**/resources/{command-name}/`
- Resources referenced via relative paths from the markdown file
- No `.md` files in `commands/` (they become executable)
- Templates in command resources must use `.txt` or `.yml` extensions

**Resource file patterns:**
- One primary concern per file (don't mix unrelated templates)
- Keep shared content in parent folder, reference via relative path
  - Example: email-nurture references `../email-sequences/subject-formulas.md`
- Split files if they serve different purposes:
  - Good: email-structure.md + re-engagement-copy.md
  - Bad: email-copy-template.md (mixing everything)
- Avoid duplication: If two agents need same resource, one file in shared location

### Behaviors
- Skills = knowledge (Claude MAY follow)
- Hooks = enforcement (FORCES behavior)
- Agents do autonomous work, not just advice
- `name:` in frontmatter overrides path-based naming

**Skill vs Agent:**

| Type | Execution | Tools | Convert When |
|------|-----------|-------|--------------|
| Skill | Inline (main conversation) | Optional `allowed-tools` | N/A — default for guidance |
| Agent | Subprocess (Task tool) | Own context | Autonomous multi-step workflow |

Wrong: "Has tools → must be agent" · Right: "Does autonomous workflow → should be agent"

### Agent/Skill Pairing Pattern
When an agent invokes a skill:
- AGENT responsibility: Workflow steps, validation, error handling, delivery
  - Gather context → Validate inputs → Analyze situation → Invoke skill → Validate output
- SKILL responsibility: Templates, frameworks, patterns
  - Receives structured context from agent
  - Does the actual work (writes, builds, creates)
- RULE: Remove duplication — if agent contains the template, don't duplicate in skill

### Command Naming
- Bare names by default: `name: command-name` → invoked as `/command-name`
- Choose self-descriptive verbs (`/commit`, `/migrate`, `/triage-prs`)
- Add prefix only when bare loses meaning (workflow-starters like `start`, `new`):
  - Plugin prefix for top-level entry points: `majestic-founder:start` → `/majestic-founder:start`
  - Group prefix for subdirectory commands: `tasks:new` → `/tasks:new`
- Never use `majestic:*` (legacy, refers to nonexistent plugin)
- Never stack prefixes (`majestic-engineer:git:commit` — pick one)

### Validation

**New skills:** Run `skill-linter` before committing.

**Modifying existing skills:**
1. Read entire skill file first
2. Make focused edits (one concern per Edit call)
3. Run `skill-linter` on modified skill(s)
4. Verify line count remains under 500

**When to run skill-linter (precondition gate):**
- Run ONLY when the diff contains `SKILL.md` files
- Gate: `git diff --name-only HEAD | grep -E '^plugins/.*/skills/[^/]+/SKILL\.md$'`
- If empty → skip lint entirely (no skills modified, nothing to validate)
- Never point at plugin roots, repo roots, or arbitrary paths — `[FAIL] SKILL.md not found` is operator error, not a real signal
- Do not run reflexive "smoke checks" to look thorough; lint exists to validate skills, nothing else

**How to invoke `skill-linter`:** It is a **skill** at `.claude/skills/skill-linter/`, NOT an agent.
- Correct: `Skill("skill-linter", args: "path/to/skill-dir")` — path must be a directory containing `SKILL.md`
- Wrong: `Agent(subagent_type: "majestic-tools:skill-linter")` ← does not exist
- Wrong: pointing at plugin root or repo root (no `SKILL.md` there)
- Bash equivalent: `bash .claude/skills/skill-linter/scripts/validate-skill.sh path/to/skill-dir`
- Batch over modified skills:
  ```
  git diff --name-only HEAD | grep -E '^plugins/.*/skills/[^/]+/SKILL\.md$' | xargs -n1 dirname | sort -u | \
    xargs -I{} bash .claude/skills/skill-linter/scripts/validate-skill.sh {}
  ```

### Content Rules
Skills = LLM instructions, not human docs. Must contain NEW info Claude doesn't know.

| Exclude | Include |
|-----------|-----------|
| Attribution ("using X's framework") | Concrete limits, exact templates |
| Source credits, decorative quotes | Project-specific patterns |
| Persona statements ("You are an expert") | Names that define style (DHH, Warren Buffett) |
| "Inspired by X" credibility signals | Stage/scope context ($0-$10M ARR, enterprise) |

**Single test:** "Does this line improve LLM behavior?" If no, cut it.

**Framing:** Use `**Audience:**` + `**Goal:**` instead of personas. "Explain X for audience Y" > "Act as persona Z"

**Self-contained:** Document patterns you implement, not who inspired them. Credits go in separate section.

### Agent Instruction Patterns
- **Pseudocode format (not prose):**
  - Good: `If X: do Y | Else: do Z`
  - Good: `For each ITEM in LIST: process ITEM`
  - Good: `While CONDITION: loop body`
  - Bad: "Check if X exists, and if so, do Y" (prose)
  - Bad: "This step is optional unless..." (conditional prose)
- **Variables enable control flow (required, not optional):**
  ```
  RESULT = Task(...) → If RESULT.status == PASS: proceed
  ITEMS = config_read("...", "[]") → For each I in ITEMS: invoke(I)
  ```
- **Schemas over examples:** Document I/O with YAML/JSON schemas
  - Good: `task_id: string # T1, T2 (from header)`
  - Bad: Markdown example blocks expecting agent to infer structure
- **Command invocation:** `/command-name args` (direct slash syntax)
- **Config reads:** `config_read("field", "default")` (invokes `config-reader` skill)
- **Arrays for extensibility:** `methodology: [tdd]` not `methodology: tdd`

### Agent/Command Doc Structure
**Include:**
- Purpose (1 line max)
- Input Schema (YAML)
- Workflow (pseudocode only)
- Output Schema (YAML)
- Error Handling (decision table)

**Exclude:**
- "How It Works" narratives
- "Critical Rules" / "Notes" / "Safety" prose
- "Monitoring" / "Examples" sections

### Verification Phase Separation
- **Quality Gate:** lint, typecheck, tests, security (standard checks)
- **Acceptance Criteria:** task-specific behavior (file exists, endpoint returns X)
- Don't include quality gate checks in AC (no "npm run typecheck passes")

### Anti-Patterns
- Do NOT hardcode language/framework-specific agents in generic orchestrators
  - Bad: Putting "majestic-rails:auth-researcher" directly in blueprint.md
  - Good: Use toolbox-resolver to discover stack-specific capabilities dynamically
  - Reason: Multi-stack projects need flexible composition, not hard dependencies

### Multi-Stack Projects
- `tech_stack` in .agents.yml can be string or array
- Example: `tech_stack: [rails, react]` is valid
- Toolbox configs must support merging capabilities from multiple stacks
- toolbox-resolver unions configs, not picks one stack

### Version Bumping (Schema Changes)
When modifying .agents.yml schema or adding config dependencies:
- Bump `plugins/majestic-engineer/skills/init-agents-config/CONFIG_VERSION`
- Update `docs/plugin-architecture/CONFIG-SYSTEM.md` version history
- Bump plugin version in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for affected plugins
- Update `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` entries
- All version bumps committed together with schema changes

### Checkpoint Before Major Refactors
When discovering incorrect patterns that require moving/restructuring files:
1. Clarify the correct approach (present options)
2. Wait for user confirmation before refactoring
3. Don't assume path patterns - verify with user or docs

**Content removal decision:**

| Content Type | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| Persona/role description | Safe to remove |
| Template/framework | Keep or move to `resources/` |
| Stage/scope context | Keep (functional) |
| Execution logic | Move to agent workflow |

When in doubt: keep it, ask user. Don't assume "cleanup" is correct.

### Plugin Architecture Decisions
- For new orchestration systems (loops, workflows), create **separate plugins**
- Don't add to existing feature plugins unless tightly coupled to that plugin's core domain
- Separate plugins are easier to install/remove independently

### State Files: Ephemeral vs Permanent
- Session working files: Use `.local.` suffix (gitignored)
- Example: `.claude/workflow-progress.local.yml` during iteration
- Promote valuable patterns to permanent docs (AGENTS.md) at session end
- Ephemeral files = working memory; Permanent docs = durable knowledge

### Data Format Selection
- For progress/state tracking, prefer YAML over markdown
- YAML: structured, parseable, patterns accessible at top level
- Markdown: patterns buried in narrative, harder to parse

## Plugin Release Checklist

1. Update version in **both** files (must match):
   - `plugins/PLUGIN/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
   - `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
2. Update internal references to new plugin namespace
3. Commit registry + plugin files together
4. README must include "What Makes This Different" section for new plugins
