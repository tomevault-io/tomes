description: Generate hierarchical AGENTS.md structure for codebases to optimize AI agent token usage. Use when creating AGENTS.md files, documenting codebase structure, setting up agent guidance, organizing project documentation for AI tools, implementing JIT indexing, or working with monorepos that need lightweight root guidance with detailed sub-folder documentation. Covers repository analysis, root AGENTS.md generation, sub-folder AGENTS.md creation, and token-efficient documentation patterns. Use when this capability is needed.

# Hierarchical Agents Documentation Generator

## Purpose

Create a **hierarchical AGENTS.md system** for codebases that enables AI coding agents to work efficiently with minimal token usage. Generates lightweight root documentation with detailed sub-folder guidance following the "nearest-wins" principle.

## When to Use

- Creating AGENTS.md documentation for a new project
- Setting up AI agent guidance for a monorepo
- Optimizing existing documentation for token efficiency
- Implementing JIT (Just-In-Time) indexing patterns

## Process

Follow these phases in order. See [references/generation-process.md](references/generation-process.md) for complete details.

### Phase 1: Repository Analysis

Analyze the codebase:
1. Repository type (monorepo, multi-package, simple)
2. Technology stack (languages, frameworks, tools)
3. Major directories (apps, services, packages)
4. Build system and testing setup
5. Key patterns, conventions, anti-patterns

**Output**: Structured map of the repository before generating any files.

### Phase 2: Generate Root AGENTS.md

Root must be lightweight: ~100-200 lines maximum, universal guidance only. Acts as index and navigation hub. Agents read the closest AGENTS.md to the file being edited — sub-folder files override root (nearest-wins).

Create root file with these sections:

1. **Project Snapshot** (3-5 lines)
   - Repo type
   - Primary tech stack
   - Note about sub-package AGENTS.md files
2. **Root Setup Commands** (5-10 lines)
   - Install dependencies, build all, typecheck all, test all
3. **Universal Conventions** (5-10 lines)
   - Code style (TypeScript strict? Prettier? ESLint?)
   - Commit format (Conventional Commits?)
   - Branch strategy
   - PR requirements
4. **Implementation Rules** (2-3 lines) — see example below
5. **Development Workflow** (5-7 lines) — see example below
6. **Security & Secrets** (3-5 lines)
   - Never commit tokens
   - Where secrets go (.env patterns)
   - PII handling
7. **JIT Index - Directory Map** (10-20 lines) — see example below
   - Reference files by path, not content
   - Provide search commands that agents can execute
8. **Acceptance Criteria** (3-5 lines)
   - Pre-PR checklist
   - What must pass

**Example Implementation Rules**:
```markdown
## Implementation Rules

Before adding ANY external dependency (gems, npm packages, GitHub Actions, Docker images, APIs, CDN links):
- Use WebSearch to verify the latest stable version BEFORE implementation
- Never trust training data for version numbers
```

**Example JIT Index**:
```markdown
## JIT Index (what to open, not what to paste)

### Package Structure
- Web UI: `apps/web/` -> [see apps/web/AGENTS.md](apps/web/AGENTS.md)
- API: `apps/api/` -> [see apps/api/AGENTS.md](apps/api/AGENTS.md)
- Shared packages: `packages/**/` -> [see packages/README.md]

### Quick Find Commands
- Search function: `rg -n "functionName" apps/** packages/**`
- Find component: `rg -n "export.*ComponentName" apps/web/src`
- Find API routes: `rg -n "export const (GET|POST)" apps/api`
```

**Example Development Workflow**:
```markdown
## Development Workflow

- Before coding -> describe approach -> wait for approval
- Ambiguous requirements -> ask first
- If task touches >3 files -> decompose first
- After coding -> list breakage risks + suggest tests
- Bug fix -> write failing test -> fix until green
- When corrected -> add lesson to .agents/lessons/
```

### Phase 3: Generate Sub-Folder AGENTS.md Files

Sub-folders have MORE detail than root — specific patterns, technology-specific conventions, real file examples from the codebase.

For EACH major package/directory, create detailed AGENTS.md:

1. **Package Identity** (2-3 lines)
2. **Setup & Run** (5-10 lines)
3. **Patterns & Conventions** (10-20 lines) - MOST IMPORTANT
4. **Touch Points / Key Files** (5-10 lines)
5. **JIT Index Hints** (5-10 lines)
6. **Common Gotchas** (3-5 lines)
7. **Pre-PR Checks** (2-3 lines)

**Key**: Patterns & Conventions must include real file paths with DO/DON'T examples.

### Phase 4: Special Considerations

Adapt templates for specific package types (Design System, Database, API, Testing).
See [references/generation-process.md](references/generation-process.md) for specialized templates.

## Directory Structures

### Monorepo
```
AGENTS.md                    # Root (lightweight)
apps/
  web/AGENTS.md             # Frontend details
  api/AGENTS.md             # Backend details
packages/
  ui/AGENTS.md              # Design system details
  shared/AGENTS.md          # Shared code details
```

### Simple Project
```
AGENTS.md                    # Root (can be more detailed)
src/
  components/AGENTS.md      # Component patterns
  services/AGENTS.md        # Service patterns
```

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Root AGENTS.md is under 200 lines
- [ ] Root links to all sub-AGENTS.md files
- [ ] Each sub-file has concrete examples (actual file paths)
- [ ] Commands are copy-paste ready
- [ ] No duplication between root and sub-files
- [ ] Every DO has a real file example
- [ ] Every DON'T references real anti-pattern
- [ ] All paths are relative and verified to exist
- [ ] Only major packages/domains have AGENTS.md — not every directory

## Maintenance

Update AGENTS.md when:
- Adding new packages or major directories
- Changing build/test commands
- Establishing new conventions
- Refactoring project structure
