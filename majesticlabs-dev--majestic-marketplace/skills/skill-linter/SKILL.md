description: Validate skills against agentskills.io specification. Use when adding new skills to the marketplace, reviewing skill PRs, checking skill compliance, or running quality gates on skills. Validates frontmatter fields (name, description, compatibility, metadata, allowed-tools), directory naming, line limits, and structure. Use when this capability is needed.

# Skill Linter

## When to Use

- Adding new skills to the marketplace
- Reviewing skill PRs
- Running quality gates before merge
- Checking existing skills for compliance

## Validation Rules

### Required Frontmatter

| Field | Constraints |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | 1-64 chars, lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens, no leading/trailing/consecutive hyphens, must match parent directory name. Cannot contain "claude" or "anthropic" (reserved). |
| `description` | 1-1024 chars, non-empty, should include keywords for discoverability. No XML angle brackets (< >). |

### Optional Frontmatter

| Field | Constraints |
|-------|-------------|
| `compatibility` | 1-500 chars, environment requirements |
| `metadata` | Key-value pairs (string values only) |
| `allowed-tools` | Space-delimited tool list (FAIL on commas or array syntax) |

### Structure Requirements

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Directory name | Must match `name` field exactly |
| SKILL.md | Required, must exist |
| README.md | Must NOT exist inside skill folder (docs go in SKILL.md or references/) |
| Line limit | Max 500 lines in SKILL.md |
| Subdirectories | Only `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` allowed |

### Content Quality Rules

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| No ASCII art | Box-drawing characters (─│┌┐└┘├┤┬┴┼), arrows (↑↓←→↔), and decorative diagrams waste tokens. LLMs tokenize character-by-character, not visually. Use plain lists or tables instead. |
| No decorative quotes | Inspirational quotes or attributions ("As X said...") have no functional value for LLM execution. |
| No persona statements | "You are an expert..." wastes tokens. Use **Audience:** / **Goal:** framing instead. |
| Functional content only | Every line should improve LLM behavior. Ask: "Does this help Claude execute better?" |

### Audience/Goal Framing (Required)

Replace persona roleplay with audience-focused framing:

**❌ Bad (persona):**
```
You are an expert software engineer with deep expertise in testing.
Your role is to analyze code and generate thorough test coverage.
```

**✅ Good (audience/goal):**
```
**Audience:** Developers needing test coverage for new or changed code.

**Goal:** Generate comprehensive tests based on specified test type and framework.
```

**Rationale:** "Explain X for audience Y" yields better-tailored outputs than "Act as persona Z".

**ASCII Art Detection Pattern:**
```regex
[─│┌┐└┘├┤┬┴┼╭╮╯╰═║╔╗╚╝╠╣╦╩╬↑↓←→↔⇒⇐⇔▲▼◄►]{3,}
```

Files matching this pattern should be flagged for review.

### Description Routing Quality (WARN)

Skill descriptions are routing logic, not documentation. They answer:
- **When** to use this skill (trigger conditions)
- **When NOT** to use (negative routing)
- **What outputs** to expect (success criteria)

| Quality Level | Example |
|---------------|---------|
| Good | "Use when implementing Stimulus controllers. Not for React components. Outputs controller with targets and actions." |
| Adequate | "Use when working with Stimulus controllers in Rails applications." |
| Poor | "Stimulus controller development skill." |
| Anti-pattern | "Comprehensive, powerful toolkit for building cutting-edge Stimulus controllers." |

Templates inside skills are encouraged — loaded only on trigger, essentially free tokens.

### Skill Disambiguation (INFO)

When multiple skills cover similar domains, include negative routing:

**Example (minitest vs rspec):**

| Skill | Description Routing |
|-------|-------------------|
| `minitest-coder` | "Use when writing Minitest tests. Not for RSpec — use rspec-coder instead." |
| `rspec-coder` | "Use when writing RSpec tests. Not for Minitest — use minitest-coder instead." |

"Don't use when..." is as important as "Use when..." for routing accuracy.

### Name Pattern

```regex
^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(-[a-z0-9]+)*$
```

**Valid:** `my-skill`, `skill1`, `api-v2-handler`
**Invalid:** `-skill`, `skill-`, `my--skill`, `MySkill`, `my_skill`

### Command/Agent Invocation Patterns

Skills should primarily provide knowledge, not orchestration. If invocations are needed:

| Pattern | Status | Use Instead |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `Skill("command", args: "...")` | ❌ Deprecated | `/command args` |
| `SlashCommand("command", ...)` | ❌ Deprecated | `/command args` |
| `Task(subagent_type="agent", ...)` | ✅ Correct | (no change) |

**✅ Preferred command invocation:**
```
/majestic:config tech_stack generic
/majestic-engineer:tdd-workflow
/majestic-ralph:start "task" --max-iterations 50
```

**❌ Deprecated patterns:**
```
Skill("config-reader", args: "tech_stack generic")
SlashCommand("majestic:build-task", args: "...")
```

**Note:** Agent invocation via `Task()` is correct - there is no `@agent` syntax.

## Usage

### Validate Single Skill

```bash
./scripts/validate-skill.sh path/to/skill-name
```

### Validate All Marketplace Skills

```bash
for skill in plugins/*/skills/*/; do
  ./scripts/validate-skill.sh "$skill"
done
```

### CI Integration

Add to pre-commit hook or CI pipeline:

```yaml
- name: Lint Skills
  run: |
    for skill in plugins/*/skills/*/; do
      .claude/skills/skill-linter/scripts/validate-skill.sh "$skill" || exit 1
    done
```

## Validation Script

The linter script at `scripts/validate-skill.sh` performs these checks:

1. **Directory exists** with SKILL.md file
2. **Frontmatter present** with YAML delimiters
3. **Name field valid** - pattern, length, matches directory
4. **Reserved words** - name cannot contain "claude" or "anthropic" (FAIL)
5. **Description field valid** - present, length constraints
6. **XML tags in frontmatter** - no angle brackets `< >` (security, FAIL)
7. **No README.md** - inside skill folder (WARN)
8. **Optional fields valid** - if present, match constraints
9. **Line count** - under 500 lines
10. **Subdirectory names** - only allowed directories
11. **No ASCII art** - box-drawing characters outside fenced code blocks (WARN)
12. **No persona statements** - "You are a/an/the" outside fenced code blocks (FAIL)
13. **Description routing quality** - routing keywords present (WARN)
14. **Marketing copy detection** - buzzwords in description (WARN)

## Error Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | All validations passed |
| 1 | Missing SKILL.md |
| 2 | Invalid frontmatter |
| 3 | Name validation failed |
| 4 | Description validation failed |
| 5 | Optional field validation failed |
| 6 | Line limit exceeded |
| 7 | Invalid subdirectory |
| 8 | ASCII art detected (warning) |
| 9 | Persona statement detected |
| 10 | Description routing quality (warning) |
| 11 | Marketing copy detected (warning) |

## Example Output

```
Validating: plugins/majestic-tools/skills/brainstorming

[PASS] SKILL.md exists
[PASS] Frontmatter present
[PASS] Name 'brainstorming' valid (12 chars)
[PASS] Name matches directory
[PASS] Description valid (156 chars)
[PASS] Line count: 87/500
[PASS] Subdirectories valid
[PASS] No ASCII art outside code blocks
[PASS] No persona statements
[PASS] Description has routing keywords
[PASS] No marketing copy in description

Result: ALL CHECKS PASSED
```

## Spec Reference

Based on [agentskills.io/specification](https://agentskills.io/specification):

- **Progressive disclosure** - Metadata ~100 tokens at startup, full content <5000 tokens when activated
- **Reference files** - Keep one level deep from SKILL.md
- **Token budget** - Main SKILL.md recommended under 500 lines
