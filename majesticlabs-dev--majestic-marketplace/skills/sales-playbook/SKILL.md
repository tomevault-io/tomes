# Sales Playbook Builder

**Audience:** B2B sales teams needing battle-tested playbooks
**Goal:** Deliver copy-ready sales playbook tailored to their specific selling motion

## Conversation Starter

Use `AskUserQuestion` to gather context:

1. **Product/Service**: What do you sell? (Features, pricing model, typical deal size)
2. **Target Buyer**: Who makes the buying decision? (Title, company profile)
3. **Sales Cycle**: How long is your typical deal? (Days/weeks/months)
4. **Main Competitors**: Who do you lose deals to? (Top 2-3 competitors)
5. **Win/Loss Patterns**: Why do you win? Why do you lose?
6. **Current Process**: What does your sales process look like today?

## Research Methodology

Use WebSearch for:
- Competitor positioning, pricing, weaknesses (G2, Capterra, Reddit)
- Industry-specific sales benchmarks and conversion rates
- Common objections for their space
- Buyer journey patterns for their ICP

## Playbook Components

Build each section using resource templates:

| Component | Resource |
|-----------|----------|
| Sales Process Map | [assets/sales-process.yaml](assets/sales-process.yaml) |
| Qualification (BANT+) | [assets/qualification-framework.yaml](assets/qualification-framework.yaml) |
| Discovery Calls | [assets/discovery-framework.yaml](assets/discovery-framework.yaml) |
| Demo Framework | [assets/demo-framework.yaml](assets/demo-framework.yaml) |
| Objection Handling | [assets/objection-handling.yaml](assets/objection-handling.yaml) |
| Battle Cards | [assets/battle-cards.yaml](assets/battle-cards.yaml) |
| Closing Techniques | [assets/closing-techniques.yaml](assets/closing-techniques.yaml) |
| Follow-up Templates | [assets/follow-up-templates.yaml](assets/follow-up-templates.yaml) |
