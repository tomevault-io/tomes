# AEO Scorecard: Measuring AI Visibility

## The Four AEO Metrics

Track these metrics to measure Answer Engine Optimization success:

### 1. AI Visibility

**Definition:** Are you recommended for your priority queries?

**How to Measure:**
- Test priority queries in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude
- Document which queries return your brand
- Track visibility over time (weekly/monthly)

**Tools:**
- HubSpot AEO Grader (free audit)
- XFunnel (comprehensive tracking)
- Manual testing with query lists

**Target:** Appear in recommendations for 60%+ of priority queries.

### 2. AI Share of Voice

**Definition:** Of all recommendations for a query, how often is YOUR brand named vs. competitors?

**Calculation:**
```
Share of Voice = (Your mentions / Total brand mentions) × 100
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Distinguishes platform changes (everyone drops) from brand failures (you drop, competitors stay)
- Tracks competitive position in AI recommendations

**Example:**
- Query: "Best CRM for small business"
- Total recommendations across 10 AI sessions: 50 brand mentions
- Your brand mentioned: 8 times
- Share of Voice: 16%

**Target:** Match or exceed your traditional search market share.

### 3. AI Citations

**Definition:** How often is YOUR WEBSITE the source of the answer?

**Why It Matters:**
- Being cited = more positive recommendation
- Citation = authority signal for future queries
- Direct traffic potential from "learn more" links

**How to Track:**
- Monitor AI bot traffic in analytics (GPTBot, Anthropic-AI, etc.)
- Use XFunnel to track citation sources
- Test queries and note source attribution

**Target:** Be cited (not just mentioned) in 30%+ of relevant queries.

### 4. Referral Demand

**Definition:** Traffic and conversions that originated in AI but didn't click through immediately.

**The Problem:** AI users often:
1. Get answer from AI
2. Remember brand name
3. Search directly or visit later
4. No referral attribution

**How to Measure:**
Implement post-purchase survey:
- "How did you first hear about us?"
- Options: "AI assistant (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.)"

**Survey Placement:**
- Post-purchase confirmation
- Onboarding flow
- Trial signup

**Target:** Track trend over time; aim for growth in AI-attributed discovery.
