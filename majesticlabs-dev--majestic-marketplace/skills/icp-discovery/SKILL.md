# ICP Discovery

## Why ICP Matters

Everything downstream depends on ICP clarity:
- **Outbound**: Who do you target?
- **Ads**: What audiences do you build?
- **Content**: Who are you writing for?
- **Sales calls**: What pain points do you probe?
- **Pricing**: What's their willingness to pay?
- **Product**: What features matter most?

Bad ICP = wasted CAC, low conversion, high churn.

## Conversation Starter

Use `AskUserQuestion` to gather initial context. Begin by asking:

"I'll help you discover and define your Ideal Customer Profile systematically.

Please provide:

1. **What you sell**: Product/service, price point, contract length
2. **Current customers**: Who are your best customers today? (Names, types, or descriptions)
3. **Worst customers**: Who churned fastest or was most painful to serve?
4. **Sales cycle**: How long? Who's involved in decisions?
5. **Current hypothesis**: Who do you THINK your ICP is?
6. **Data available**: Do you have access to customer data, CRM, or analytics?

I'll research your market and help you build a validated ICP framework."

## Research Methodology

Use WebSearch extensively to find:
- Industry benchmarks for their product category
- Competitor positioning and target segments
- Job postings that signal buying intent for their category
- Community discussions (Reddit, LinkedIn) about their problem space
- Technographic data patterns (what tools their ICP likely uses)

## Required Deliverables

### 1. Current State Analysis

Analyze best vs. worst customers to find patterns:
- Best customers: Industry, size, ACV, time to close, why they bought
- Worst customers: Why they churned, warning signs
- Hypothesis vs. reality gaps

Full template: [assets/icp-templates.yaml](assets/icp-templates.yaml)

### 2. Firmographic Criteria

| Criterion | Ideal | Acceptable | Disqualify |
|-----------|-------|------------|------------|
| Employee count | [Range] | [Range] | [Range] |
| Annual revenue | [Range] | [Range] | [Range] |
| Industry | [List] | [List] | [List] |
| Geography | [Regions] | [Regions] | [Regions] |

Plus: Technographic signals (CRM, marketing tools, engineering stack) and organizational signals (hiring patterns, funding, growth metrics).

### 3. Psychographic Criteria

- **Pain point intensity**: Score 1-10 with urgency and frequency
- **Trigger events**: What creates buying urgency (new exec, funding, competitor loss)
- **Buying behavior**: Research style, decision speed, risk tolerance
- **Mindset & values**: Growth orientation, tech adoption

Full template: [assets/icp-templates.yaml](assets/icp-templates.yaml)

### 4. Buyer Personas (Within ICP)

| Persona | Key Info |
|---------|----------|
| **Economic Buyer** | Goals, fears, success metrics, objections |
| **Champion** | Why they champion, how to enable them |
| **User** | Daily workflow, frustrations, adoption drivers |
| **Blocker** | Why they block, how to neutralize |

Full persona templates: [assets/icp-templates.yaml](assets/icp-templates.yaml)

### 5. Anti-ICP Definition

- **Hard disqualifiers**: Signals that mean instant disqualify
- **Soft disqualifiers**: Proceed with caution
- **Time-waster profiles**: Tire kicker, feature demander, discount hunter, consensus seeker
- **Red flag questions**: What prospects ask that signals bad fit

### 6. ICP Scoring Matrix

| Criterion | Weight | 3 (Ideal) | 2 (Good) | 1 (OK) | 0 (DQ) |
|-----------|--------|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| Company size | X% | [Criteria] | [Criteria] | [Criteria] | [Criteria] |
| Industry | X% | [Criteria] | [Criteria] | [Criteria] | [Criteria] |
| Pain intensity | X% | [Criteria] | [Criteria] | [Criteria] | [Criteria] |
| Commitment velocity | 10-15% | 3+ micro-yes/week | 1-2/week | <1/week | Ghosting |

**Score interpretation:**
- 85-100%: Tier 1 (prioritize)
- 70-84%: Tier 2 (standard process)
- 50-69%: Tier 3 (qualify harder)
- <50%: Not ICP

### 7. ICP Segments (If Multiple)

For each segment:
- Company size, industry, primary pain, buyer title
- ACV and sales cycle
- Go-to-market motion (PLG/Sales-led/Hybrid)
- Prioritization based on TAM, win rate, LTV

### 8. Validation Methodology

- Interview 5-10 best-fit customers
- Validate each signal with data
- Monitor for ICP drift
- Quarterly review cadence

Full framework: [assets/validation-activation.yaml](assets/validation-activation.yaml)

### 9. Activation Checklist

Update: Outbound targeting, ad audiences, lead scoring, website copy, sales playbook, content calendar, case studies, SDR training.

## Quality Standards

- **Data-driven**: Derive ICP from actual customer data, not assumptions
- **Specific enough to act on**: Should be able to build a lead list from this
- **Broad enough to scale**: Should represent a reachable market
- **Validated**: Include methodology to test and refine

## Tone

Strategic and analytical. Write like a revenue operations leader who has built ICP frameworks for multiple successful companies. Challenge assumptions, demand data, and push for specificity.
