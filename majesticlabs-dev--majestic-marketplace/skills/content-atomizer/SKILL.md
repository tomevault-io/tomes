# Content Atomizer

Transform one piece of long-form content into 19 platform-ready distribution assets across social, video, audio, written, and interactive formats.

## What This Produces

**1 long-form piece → 19 platform-ready assets**

- 6 social (Thread, LinkedIn, IG, Short Post, Threads, Pinterest)
- 5 video/audio (Video, TikTok, Shorts, Audiogram, Podcast)
- 3 written (Email, Blog spin-offs, SEO snippets)
- 5 interactive/visual (Quiz, Discussion, Challenge, Infographic, Quotes)

## Input

Ask the user to provide:
1. **Source content** - URL, file path, or paste the content directly
2. **Target platforms** - Which outputs they want (default: all)
3. **Audience context** - Who is this for? (optional but helpful)

If the user just pastes content, proceed immediately. Don't over-ask.

## Output Formats

**19 formats across 5 categories.** Templates in `assets/`:
- `social-templates.yaml` - Twitter, LinkedIn, IG, Threads, Pinterest
- `video-audio-templates.yaml` - Video, TikTok, Shorts, Audiogram, Podcast
- `written-templates.yaml` - Email, Blog spin-offs, SEO snippets
- `interactive-templates.yaml` - Quiz, Discussion, Challenge
- `visual-templates.yaml` - Infographic, Quote graphics

## Atomization Process

### Step 1: Extract Core Elements

From the source content, identify:
- **Central thesis** - The one big idea (1 sentence)
- **Key insights** - 3-7 supporting points
- **Stories/examples** - Concrete illustrations
- **Data/stats** - Quotable numbers
- **Contrarian angles** - What goes against common belief
- **Actionable takeaways** - What reader can DO

### Step 2: Platform Mapping

| Element | Best Formats | Buyer Stage |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Central thesis | LinkedIn post, Video hook, Audiogram | Awareness |
| Key insights | Thread, Carousel, Podcast segment | Awareness/Consideration |
| Stories | TikTok, Video script, Discussion prompt | Awareness |
| Data/stats | Infographic, Pinterest, Quote graphic | Consideration |
| Contrarian take | Tweet, Threads, Reddit post | Awareness |
| Actionable takeaways | Email, Challenge, Quiz | Consideration/Decision |
| How-to steps | YouTube Shorts, Blog spin-off, Carousel | Decision |
| Social proof | Case study excerpt, Quote graphic | Decision |

### Step 2b: Buyer Journey Mapping

Map each asset to the customer journey:

```
AWARENESS (Top of Funnel)
├── Twitter/X Thread - hook with big idea
├── TikTok/Reels - pattern interrupt
├── Audiogram - quotable insight
├── Discussion prompts - start conversations
└── Threads post - authentic take

CONSIDERATION (Middle of Funnel)
├── LinkedIn Carousel - educational depth
├── Podcast outline - deep dive
├── Infographic - visual summary
├── Blog spin-offs - SEO capture
├── Quiz/Poll - engagement + education
└── YouTube Shorts - how-to snippets

DECISION (Bottom of Funnel)
├── Email excerpt - direct CTA
├── Pinterest pin - save for later
├── SEO snippets - capture search intent
├── Challenge prompt - activation
└── Quote graphics - social proof
```

**Strategy:** Release awareness content first, then consideration, then decision. Don't blast all at once.

### Step 3: Generate Assets

Create each format using the templates above. Customize hooks for each platform's audience.

## Quick Mode vs. Deep Mode

### Quick Mode (Default)
Just atomize the content using the templates. Fast, reliable, good enough.

### Deep Mode
When user asks for "optimized" or "researched" versions:
1. Use WebSearch to find top-performing content in their niche
2. Analyze current platform algorithm priorities
3. Customize hooks based on what's working NOW
4. Add platform-specific hashtag/timing recommendations

## Platform Algorithm Notes (2025-2026)

| Platform | Algorithm Priority | What to Optimize |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Twitter/X | Replies, quotes, bookmarks | Controversial hooks, question endings |
| LinkedIn | Dwell time, comments | First line hook, carousel saves |
| Instagram | Saves, shares, watch time | Reels completion, carousel swipes |
| TikTok | Completion rate, shares | First 2 seconds, save prompts |
| YouTube Shorts | Watch time, subscribe clicks | Hook + payoff loop |
| Pinterest | Saves, click-through | Keyword-rich descriptions |
| Threads | Replies, reposts | Authentic voice, no hard CTAs |
| Podcast | Completion, reviews | Strong intro, clear segments |

**Universal 2025-2026 Trends:**
- "Follow for more" CTAs penalized across platforms
- Saves/bookmarks weighted higher than likes
- Completion rate matters more than views
- Native content outperforms cross-posted
- Carousels/threads outperform single posts

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering, verify:

### Format Quality
- [ ] Each format uses platform-native conventions
- [ ] Hooks are DIFFERENT across platforms (not copy-paste)
- [ ] Video scripts are speakable (read aloud test)
- [ ] Carousels work standalone (no context needed)
- [ ] Audio scripts work with sound OFF (text overlays noted)

### Content Quality
- [ ] No AI-slop phrases ("In today's landscape", "Let's dive in", "Game-changer")
- [ ] Each piece has ONE clear takeaway
- [ ] CTAs are platform-appropriate (soft for TikTok/Threads, direct for email)
- [ ] Hooks create genuine curiosity, not clickbait

### Strategic Quality
- [ ] Assets mapped to buyer journey stages
- [ ] Staggered release calendar makes sense
- [ ] High-value formats prioritized (not just easy ones)
- [ ] Internal linking strategy for blog spin-offs

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- **Design visuals** - Provides copy/outlines for infographics, not actual graphics
- **Schedule posts** - Provides content and timing guidance, not automation
- **Write the original** - Atomizes existing content only (use `content-writer` for original)
- **Record audio/video** - Provides scripts, not production
- **Post to platforms** - Provides content, user must publish

## When to Use This vs. Other Skills

| Use `content-atomizer` when... | Use other skills when... |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| You have finished long-form content | Creating original content (`content-writer`) |
| Need multi-platform distribution | Single platform strategy (`linkedin-content`) |
| Want to maximize one piece's reach | Building content calendar (`content-calendar`) |
| Repurposing newsletters, articles | Writing from scratch (`viral-content`) |
| Need 15+ assets from one piece | Need just 1-2 quick posts |
| Strategic buyer-journey mapping | Quick social post (`hook-writer`) |
| Full atomization with calendar | Just need quote graphics |
