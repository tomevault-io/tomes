# Brand Positioning Architect

Define your brand's strategic foundation - the internal identity that drives every external expression.

## What This Creates

| Asset | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Brand Purpose** | Why you exist beyond profit |
| **Brand Values** | Principles that guide decisions |
| **Brand Personality** | Human traits that shape voice |
| **Target Audience** | Who you serve (psychographic depth) |
| **Brand Promise** | Core commitment to customers |
| **Positioning Statement** | Classic strategic framework |

## Relationship to Other Tools

| Tool | Focus | Relationship |
|------|-------|--------------|
| `brand-positioning` | WHO you are (identity) | **This tool** - foundation |
| `competitive-positioning` | HOW you differ (comparison) | Uses this as input |
| `brand-voice` | HOW you sound (expression) | Derives from personality |

## Conversation Starter

Use `AskUserQuestion` to gather context:

"I'll help you define your brand's strategic foundation - the identity that drives all your marketing and design decisions.

**What stage are you at?**

**Option A - Starting Fresh**
Answer discovery questions to build your positioning from scratch.

**Option B - Have Existing Materials**
Share what you have (mission statement, about page, pitch deck) and I'll extract and refine.

**Option C - Repositioning**
Describe current positioning and what's not working."

## Discovery Process

### Phase 1: Purpose & Values

**Question 1: Origin Story**
"Why did you start this company? What problem made you say 'someone needs to fix this'?"

**Question 2: Impact Vision**
"If you succeed wildly, what changes in the world? What do customers become?"

**Question 3: Non-Negotiables**
"What would you never do, even if profitable? What lines won't you cross?"

**Question 4: Decision Lens**
"When you face a hard choice, what principles guide you?"

### Phase 2: Audience Definition

**Question 5: Ideal Customer**
"Describe your best customer - not demographics, but their mindset, frustrations, and aspirations."

**Question 6: Emotional State**
"When someone finds you, what state are they in?"
- Frustrated (seeking relief)
- Ambitious (seeking growth)
- Confused (seeking clarity)
- Skeptical (seeking proof)
- Overwhelmed (seeking simplicity)

**Question 7: Alternatives**
"If you didn't exist, what would they do instead? (Competitor, DIY, nothing)"

### Phase 3: Personality & Tone

**Question 8: Human Traits**
"If your brand were a person at a dinner party, how would others describe them?"
- Pick 3-5: Bold, Friendly, Professional, Playful, Sophisticated, Rebellious, Trustworthy, Innovative, Warm, Direct, Quirky, Authoritative, Approachable, Provocative

**Question 9: Not This**
"What personality would be WRONG for your brand? What should you never sound like?"

**Question 10: Reference Brands**
"Name 2-3 brands whose personality you admire (any industry)."

### Phase 4: Differentiation

**Question 11: Unique Value**
"What can you honestly claim that competitors cannot?"

**Question 12: Proof**
"What evidence supports your unique claim? (Results, approach, team, technology)"

## Framework Application

### Brand Purpose Framework

**Format:** We exist to [impact] by [approach] for [audience].

**Test:** Does it pass the "so what" test 3 times?
- "We make software" → So what?
- "So teams collaborate better" → So what?
- "So companies ship faster" → So what?
- "So innovation accelerates" ← Purpose level

### Values Framework

Each value needs:

| Component | What It Answers |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Name** | What we call this value (1-2 words) |
| **Meaning** | What it actually means to us |
| **Behavior** | How it shows up in decisions |
| **Anti-pattern** | What violating this looks like |

**Example:**
- **Value:** Radical Transparency
- **Meaning:** We share context, not just conclusions
- **Behavior:** Public roadmaps, open pricing, honest limitations
- **Anti-pattern:** Hidden fees, vague messaging, overselling

### Personality Framework

Map each trait to communication implications:

| Trait | Meaning | Voice Implication | Design Implication |
|-------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Bold | We take stands | Declarative statements | High contrast, strong type |
| Warm | We care personally | Conversational tone | Soft colors, friendly imagery |
| Direct | We don't waste time | Short sentences | Clean layouts, clear CTAs |

### Positioning Statement

**Classic Format:**
> For [target audience] who [situation/need], [Brand] is the [category] that [key benefit]. Unlike [alternatives], we [differentiator] because [reason to believe].

**Parts Explained:**

| Part | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Target audience | Specificity signals fit | "For early-stage founders" |
| Situation/need | Context triggers relevance | "who need to ship fast without a dev team" |
| Category | Mental filing cabinet | "a no-code platform" |
| Key benefit | Primary value delivered | "that turns ideas into products in days" |
| Alternatives | Competitive frame | "Unlike agencies or hiring developers" |
| Differentiator | Unique advantage | "we combine templates with expert guidance" |
| Reason to believe | Proof/credibility | "backed by 500+ successful launches" |

## Quality Standards

- **Specific over generic** - "We're customer-focused" is worthless
- **Honest** - Don't manufacture differentiation that doesn't exist
- **Testable** - Values must guide actual decisions
- **Memorable** - Positioning should be repeatable without notes
- **Connected** - Each section should reinforce others

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| "We value excellence" | Every company claims this | What specific behavior does this require? |
| "For everyone who..." | No positioning power | Narrow to specific audience segment |
| "We're the best" / "Innovative solutions" | Unverifiable or meaningless | What specifically do you do differently? |
| 7+ values | Unactionable | Prioritize to 3-5 that actually guide decisions |
