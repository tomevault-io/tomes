## Clean Architecture Verification

### Layer Separation Principles

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      Presentation Layer                      │
│         (pages, components, hooks - UI concerns)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                      Application Layer                       │
│         (services, use-cases - business logic)               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                       Domain Layer                           │
│         (entities, types - core domain models)               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                    Infrastructure Layer                      │
│         (api client, db, external services)                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Dependency direction: Outside → Inside (Presentation → Domain)
Inner layers must not know about outer layers
```

### Layer-specific Verification Checklist

#### Presentation Layer (UI)
```
□ Is there business logic in components?
□ Are there direct API calls? (should go through hooks)
□ Is state management properly separated?
□ Do components have single responsibility?
```

#### Application Layer (Services)
```
□ Are domain logic and infrastructure logic separated?
□ Are external dependencies abstracted?
□ Is the structure testable?
□ Are use cases clearly defined?
```

#### Domain Layer (Types/Entities)
```
□ Are there no external library dependencies?
□ Does it contain only pure business rules?
□ Do types match Phase 1 schema?
```

#### Infrastructure Layer (API Client)
```
□ Are external service calls abstracted?
□ Is error handling consistent?
□ Is configuration managed via environment variables?
```

## 6. In-Depth Code Quality Review

### 6.1 Duplicate Code Detection

#### Detection Methods
```bash
# 1. Search for similar function names
grep -r "function.*format" src/
grep -r "function.*calculate" src/
grep -r "function.*get.*By" src/

# 2. Search for similar patterns
grep -rn "reduce.*sum" src/
grep -rn "filter.*map" src/
grep -rn "useState.*useEffect" src/
```

#### Handling by Duplication Type

| Type | Example | Solution |
|------|---------|----------|
| Exact duplicate | Same code copy-paste | Extract to function |
| Structural similarity | Same logic, different data | Parameterize |
| Conceptual similarity | Different implementations for similar purpose | Integrate or interface |

#### Duplicate Code Checklist
```
□ Is the same logic in 2+ places?
□ Are there multiple functions with similar names?
□ Is the same data transformation repeated?
□ Are similar UI patterns repeated?
□ Is the same API call pattern repeated?
□ Is similar error handling repeated?
```

### 6.2 Reusability Assessment

#### Assessment Criteria

| Score | Criteria | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| ⭐⭐⭐ | High | Can be used in other projects |
| ⭐⭐ | Medium | Can be used in multiple places within same project |
| ⭐ | Low | Used only for specific feature |

#### Reusability Checklist
```
Check for each function/component:
□ Is it tied to a specific domain?
□ Does it depend on external state?
□ Are parameters generic?
□ Is the return value predictable?
□ Are there side effects?
```

### 6.3 Extensibility Assessment

#### Extensibility Check
```
When new requirements come:
□ Can it be added without modifying existing code?
□ Can behavior be changed by configuration only?
□ Is adding new types/cases easy?
□ Can it be extended without adding conditionals?
```

#### Extensibility Anti-patterns
```typescript
// ❌ Requires modification for each extension
function process(type: string) {
  if (type === 'a') { /* ... */ }
  else if (type === 'b') { /* ... */ }
  // Add else if for each new type...
}

// ❌ Hardcoded list
const ALLOWED_TYPES = ['a', 'b', 'c']

// ❌ Enumerated switch statements
switch (action.type) {
  case 'ADD': // ...
  case 'REMOVE': // ...
  // Add case for each new action...
}
```

#### Good Extensibility Patterns
```typescript
// ✅ Registry pattern
const handlers: Record<string, Handler> = {}
function register(type: string, handler: Handler) {
  handlers[type] = handler
}
function process(type: string, data: unknown) {
  return handlers[type]?.(data)
}

// ✅ Configuration-based
const CONFIG = {
  types: ['a', 'b', 'c'],
  handlers: { ... }
}

// ✅ Plugin structure
interface Plugin { execute(data): Result }
const plugins: Plugin[] = []
```

### 6.4 Object-Oriented Principles Check

#### SOLID Principles Checklist

**S - Single Responsibility (SRP)**
```
□ Does the class/function change for only one reason?
□ Does the name clearly explain the role?
□ Is "and" in the name? → Needs separation
```

**O - Open/Closed (OCP)**
```
□ Is it open for extension? (new features can be added)
□ Is it closed for modification? (no existing code changes needed)
□ Are interfaces/abstractions used?
```

**L - Liskov Substitution (LSP)**
```
□ Can subtypes replace parent types?
□ Do overridden methods keep the contract?
```

**I - Interface Segregation (ISP)**
```
□ Is the interface too large?
□ Must unused methods be implemented?
□ Can the interface be split smaller?
```

**D - Dependency Inversion (DIP)**
```
□ Does it depend on abstractions instead of concrete classes?
□ Are dependencies injected? (DI)
□ Is the structure testable?
```

### 6.5 Refactoring Priority

```
Urgent (Required before deployment):
1. Duplication that can cause bugs
2. Security vulnerabilities
3. Performance bottlenecks

High (As soon as possible):
4. Same logic duplicated in 3+ places
5. Files over 200 lines
6. Nesting deeper than 5 levels

Medium (Next sprint):
7. Structure lacking extensibility
8. Naming inconsistencies
9. Structure difficult to test

Low (Backlog):
10. Style inconsistencies
11. Excessive comments
12. Unused code
```

## 7. AI Code Review Request Template

```markdown
Please review the code from these perspectives:

1. Duplicate Code
   - Are there similar functions/components?
   - Is there common logic that can be extracted?

2. Reusability
   - Can it be used generically?
   - Is it tied to a specific domain?

3. Extensibility
   - Can it flexibly respond to new requirements?
   - Are there hardcoded parts?

4. SOLID Principles
   - Does it follow single responsibility?
   - Is it open for extension and closed for modification?

5. Convention Compliance
   - Does it follow CONVENTIONS.md rules?
   - Is naming consistent?

Please identify parts that need refactoring and their priority.
```

## 8. Gap Analysis (Design vs Implementation)

### Gap Analysis Report Template

```markdown
# Gap Analysis Report

## Analysis Target
- Design document: docs/02-design/{feature}.design.md
- Implementation path: src/features/{feature}/

## Results by Category

### API Endpoints
| Design | Implementation | Status |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| POST /api/users | POST /api/users | ✅ Match |
| GET /api/users/:id | - | ❌ Not implemented |
| - | DELETE /api/users/:id | ⚠️ Missing from design |

### Data Model
| Design Entity | Implementation | Status |
|---------------|----------------|--------|
| User | types/user.ts | ✅ Match |
| UserRole | - | ❌ Not implemented |

### Match Rate
- Total items: 10
- Matches: 7
- Not implemented: 2
- Missing from design: 1
- **Match Rate: 70%**
```

### Gap Types and Actions

| Gap Type | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| ✅ Match | Design = Implementation | None |
| ❌ Not implemented | In design, not in code | Implement or update design |
| ⚠️ Missing from design | In code, not in design | Add to design document |
| 🔄 Different | Exists but different | Align (code is truth) |

### When to Run Gap Analysis

- After completing feature implementation
- Before deployment
- When design document is updated
- During code review
