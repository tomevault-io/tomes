# design-md (Consolidated)

This skill enables the agent to scout and apply the best design systems from the entire `design-md` ecosystem.

## 1. Discovery Strategy (Source Selection)

| User Intent | Platform | Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Famous Brand Look** (Stripe, Apple, etc.) | [getdesign.md](https://getdesign.md) | `npx getdesign add <brand>` |
| **CLI Automation / SaaS Kits** | [designmd.ai](https://designmd.ai) | `npx designmd download <id>` |
| **Community Library (400+ kits)** | [designmd.app](https://designmd.app) | Browser Search / Scrape |
| **Existing Site Replication** | [designmd.me](https://designmd.me) | URL-to-Markdown Generation |
| **Agent Setup/Rules** (Cursor, Claude) | [designmd.app/guides](https://designmd.app/en/guides) | Context-specific file creation |

## 2. Interactive Flow

### A. Scouting Phase
When a user asks for a design, scout multiple sources:
1.  **Search CLI**: `npx designmd search "<query>"`
2.  **Brand Check**: If a brand name is mentioned, check [getdesign.md](https://getdesign.md).
3.  **Library Check**: Browse [designmd.app](https://designmd.app) via `llms.txt` or browser tool.

Showcase 3-5 results with their source, description, and preview link.

### B. Selection & Setup
Guide the user through setup based on the chosen platform:
- **getdesign.md**: CLI command is free and instant.
- **designmd.ai**: Check for API Key requirement and guide setup.
- **designmd.me**: If a URL is provided, offer to visit the site and generate the markdown.

### C. Agent Integration
After applying `DESIGN.md`, reference [designmd.app/guides](https://designmd.app/en/guides) to generate:
- `.cursorrules` (for Cursor)
- `CLAUDE.md` (for Claude Code)
- `.windsurfrules` (for Windsurf)

## 3. Usage Guidelines
- **Always Scout**: Never settle for one source; check the brand collection vs the automated kits.
- **Preview First**: Provide the `designmd.ai` or `designmd.app` link for visual preview before implementation.
- **Design Consistency**: Once a kit is applied, strictly enforce its tokens in all CSS and component files.
