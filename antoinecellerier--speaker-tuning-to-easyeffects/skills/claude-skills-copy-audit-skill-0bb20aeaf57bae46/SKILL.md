# copy-audit

## Running as a subagent

This skill runs in a fresh subagent (`context: fork`): nothing from the
conversation reaches it, so everything it needs is stated here or in its
arguments, and it returns one thing — the triaged report of step 4. It does
**not** fix anything: step 5 is the maintainer's choice, made in the main
conversation from that report.

- **Range:** the argument, if one names a revision or `a..b`; otherwise
  `origin/master..HEAD` (the unpushed work). Step 2's `--since` is the
  range's base.
- **Evidence dir:** `localresearch/copy_audit/<YYYY-MM-DD>/` (gitignored),
  unless the argument names a directory that already holds the step-1
  files — then reuse them, regenerating only what is missing.
- Use absolute paths in every shell command: a `cd` that fails leaves the
  shell elsewhere for every later call.
- Run reviewers as subagents (`model: opus` — this is truth-checking, not
  comprehension) with one slice and one evidence source each, as §3 says.
- Return the step-4 report verbatim as your final message: ranked, every
  finding with severity, the true statement and its evidence, the
  discarded findings with why, the known limits, and the patterns that
  went unrendered.

`/user-review` grades comprehension. A false sentence can score perfectly
there — and historically has: that loop's own fixes were the biggest single
source of untrue statements, because simplifying a hedged sentence is how a
hypothesis becomes an assertion. One round dropped the limiter noun from the
untamed-boost warnings for good reasons and shipped "nothing limits it on its
way out", which `limiter#0` falsifies on every preset.

This audit walks a git range and checks each claim against the evidence its
**type** demands. The claim-type checklist it applies is
`.claude/rules/user-messages.md` ("Every claim is checkable").

**Non-expert phrasing is the design goal and is never a finding.** A reviewer
reporting that copy is informal, imprecise or jargon-free has misunderstood
the task. Only FALSE, UNSUPPORTED, or TRUE-ONLY-FOR-SOME-DEVICES counts.

Copy this checklist and track progress:

```
Copy audit:
- [ ] 1. Prepare the evidence (corpus sweep, renders, system probe)
- [ ] 2. Build the claim inventory
- [ ] 3. Fan out reviewers, one slice and one evidence source each
- [ ] 4. Re-check every finding yourself; discard what doesn't survive
- [ ] 5. Fix one commit per finding, then verify
```

## 1. Prepare the evidence, once

Every reviewer reads files; none re-runs a tool. This is the whole cost
control — the audit is affordable because the expensive work happens once.

```
python3 tools/corpus_audit.py > <out>/corpus_audit.txt
python3 tools/preview_output.py --full --examples 3 --width 80 > <out>/renders/findings_all.txt
python3 tools/render_forced_conditions.py --out-dir <out>/renders
```

`--examples 3` is load-bearing: the same message rendered for three different
devices is what exposes a sentence true only for the one it was written from.

`render_forced_conditions.py` covers what `preview_output.py` structurally
cannot — messages whose trigger value never occurs in the corpus, so no real
device can show them. Those are exactly the messages nobody has ever read.

Then render the conditions that need flags rather than XML values: a
`SOUNDWIRE_*` file against an HDA one, a simplified-schema file,
`--all-profiles`, `-v`, each `--disable` name, and a
`dolby_to_pipewire.py --no-activate --dry-run`. Probe the live system too
(`easyeffects --version`, `pw-cli ls Node | grep alsa_output`, `pw-link -l`,
`command -v lv2info`) — several claims are about other people's software.

## 2. Build the claim inventory

```
python3 tools/extract_claims.py --since <rev> --out-dir <out>
```

Writes `claims.md` and the per-reviewer slices. Unchanged strings stay in the
file so a claim can be read against the run it prints in; only `CHANGED` rows
are targets.

It reports two totals: a refactor that collapses a string written at two sites
legitimately shrinks the row count while the run prints the same words, so
compare the distinct count, which counts sentences rather than sites.

## 3. Fan out, partitioned by evidence source

Give each reviewer **one slice and one evidence source**. Partitioning by
evidence rather than by file is what keeps each context small: the reviewer
checking corpus figures never loads the wrapper's source, and the one checking
the wrapper never loads the docs.

| Slice | Evidence | Hunts |
|---|---|---|
| `slice_numbers.md` | `corpus_audit.txt` + `cross-device-findings.md`, plus targeted corpus greps | stale figures, universals the corpus contradicts, "rare"/"typical" with nothing behind it |
| renders/ | the rendered runs + `corpus_audit.txt` | sentences true only for the device they were written from; hardcoded Hz/band counts/profile names; contradictions inside one run |
| `slice_generator.md` | the generator's source | copy vs what the code does: flag effects, what was written, `-v` gating, gates broader or narrower than the sentence |
| `slice_generator.md` | `reference.md` "Validated vs unvalidated mappings" + `design-notes.md` | unvalidated mappings asserted as fact; a *leading hypothesis* stated as Dolby's intent |
| `slice_wrapper_docs.md` | wrapper/converter source + the live system | restart and undo instructions, command output shapes, WirePlumber/EasyEffects behaviour, package names |
| `slice_all_changed.md` | the sources themselves | CHANGELOG vs what ships, README vs the menus, one fact worded two incompatible ways |

Each returns a fixed schema, worst first, and **no restated copy**:

```
ID | SEVERITY | <=10-word quote | what is actually true | evidence file:line | confidence
```

CRITICAL false and it changes what the user does · HIGH false but low
consequence, or an unvalidated hypothesis stated as fact · MEDIUM true only
for some triggering devices · LOW stale figure, no user consequence.

Tell every reviewer: a finding must **name the true statement**. "This seems
wrong" without a replacement is not a finding, and will be discarded.

Also tell them the settled decisions from `/user-review`, so they don't
relitigate copy that survived eleven rounds — those are only reopened by
proving one *false*, not awkward.

## 4. Triage — do not forward reviewer output

Re-check every finding yourself against the code, a real run, or the system.
Reviewers misread; this audit's first run produced two claims that didn't
survive, one of them a plain misreading of a distributive sentence.

Two bars before anything ships: it names what is actually true, and it cites
evidence. Then rank, and let the user choose.

Watch for the reviewer failure mode that mirrors the writers': a **selection
effect read as a refutation**. One reviewer reported that 23 of 23 XMLs
declaring a default profile contradict the tool's assumption — but Dolby only
writes that field when they *don't* want the default, so those 23 are exactly
where a difference is expected. Ask what population a statistic is drawn from
before believing it.

## 5. Fix, one commit per finding

Corpus figures get re-derived through `resolve_xml_value`, never a bare grep —
the `preset=` indirection hides values a text search reports as absent.

Verify after: `pytest tests/` and `pytest tests/corpus -q`, and check
`tests/test_golden_preset.py` did **not** move. A copy-only fix that shifts
the golden digest touched behaviour — investigate before re-recording. Re-run
`preview_output.py` and diff against the step-1 renders: only the lines a
finding named may have changed.

## Known limits, state them in the report

- Claims about the Windows Dolby app aren't testable here. The available
  verdicts are "matches what our docs record" or "unsupported" — propose
  hedging, not deletion.
- Hardware-probe copy for smart amps can't be exercised without the hardware.
  Label those as source-verified only.
- Anything about the live audio graph is static analysis until it is heard.
  Say so, and route it through **/audio-validate**.
