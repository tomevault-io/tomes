# Triage Issues

Triage means: read each issue, decide the right labels from the taxonomy below, and
apply them with `gh issue edit`. Do not remove labels a human has already added unless
they are clearly wrong. Do not add priority labels unless the issue body or discussion
makes the priority obvious.

Two hard rules govern every run:

1. **Propose before applying.** Classify everything first and present the full set of
   proposed changes as a summary for the user to validate. Apply nothing — no labels,
   no label creation — until the user approves.
2. **Record an undo.** While applying approved changes, build an undo script that
   reverses exactly what this run did, and hand the user the command to run it.

## Label taxonomy

Every issue should have at least one `kind/` label and at least one `area/` label.
Priority and status labels are optional.

### `kind/` — what the issue is

| Label | When to apply |
|---|---|
| `kind/bug` | Something is broken or behaves incorrectly. The current behavior is wrong. |
| `kind/feature` | A new capability that does not exist today. Includes enhancements to existing features. |
| `kind/cleanup` | Code quality improvements that do not change behavior: refactors, naming, dead code removal, small inconsistencies. |
| `kind/docs` | Documentation only — missing, outdated, or incorrect docs. |
| `kind/design` | Design discussions, investigations, research, and open questions that must be resolved before implementation. Includes "Design discussion:", "Identify what X should be", "Measure/benchmark X", "Explore options". |

If any label in this taxonomy does not exist on the repo yet, include its creation in
the proposal and create it during the apply step with:
```bash
gh label create "<label>" \
  --repo agent-substrate/substrate \
  --description "<short description matching the taxonomy table>" \
  --color "c5def5"
```

### `area/` — which part of the codebase

Apply all areas that are touched. Most issues need one or two; a few need more.

| Label | Scope |
|---|---|
| `area/api` | User-facing Substrate API (`pkg/proto/ateapipb/`, proto definitions, API semantics, versioning) |
| `area/api-machinery` | API server internals: RPC handlers, storage layer, syncer, controllers (`cmd/ateapi/`, `cmd/atecontroller/`) |
| `area/network` | Networking: atenet-router, Envoy, ext_proc, DNS, xDS, ingress (`cmd/atenet/`) |
| `area/node` | Node agent and worker lifecycle: atelet, sandbox launch, OCI, cgroups (`cmd/atelet/`) |
| `area/gvisor` | gVisor sandbox specifics: runsc integration, GPU in gVisor, gVisor OCI (`cmd/ateom-gvisor/`) |
| `area/microVM` | Micro-VM sandbox specifics: cloud-hypervisor, kata, snapshot/restore (`cmd/ateom-microvm/`) |
| `area/storage` | Snapshot storage, image cache, GCS/S3 backends, retention (`internal/imagecache/`, ActorSnapshot) |
| `area/scheduling` | WorkerPool sizing, actor placement, HPA, resource allocation |
| `area/observability` | Metrics, tracing, logging, OTLP, OTel SDK integration |
| `area/security` | Auth, mTLS, RBAC, threat detection, credential management, PodCertificate |
| `area/identity` | Actor identity, token issuance, JWT auth, ActorIdentity extension |
| `area/dev-infra` | CI/CD, GitHub Actions, presubmit checks, tooling, proto generation |
| `area/tests` | Test coverage, flaky tests, test infrastructure (not a bug in production code) |
| `area/cli` | `kubectl-ate` CLI plugin |
| `area/demos` | Demo applications in `demos/` |
| `area/benchmarking` | Performance benchmarks and capacity measurements (`benchmarking/`) |
| `area/reliability` | Reliability, stability, error recovery, and uptime concerns |

### `prio/` — priority

Only apply when the issue body or a maintainer comment makes the priority evident.
Do not guess.

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `prio/P0` | Highest priority; required for next milestone or blocking ongoing work |
| `prio/P1` | Important but not blocking; should land in the near term |
| `prio/P2` | Real issue but not urgent; can wait |

### Status labels

Apply only when clearly appropriate. Never add `wontfix`, `duplicate`, or `invalid`
yourself — those are maintainer decisions.

| Label | When |
|---|---|
| `good first issue` | Well-scoped, self-contained, does not require deep system knowledge |
| `help wanted` | Maintainers actively want external contributions |

## Classification guide

Work through these questions in order:

**1. Is something broken?**
If the current behavior is incorrect, it is `kind/bug`. Security holes and data
loss are bugs, not features.

**2. Does it ask for new capability?**
If the system would need to do something it cannot do today, it is `kind/feature`.
Apply `kind/feature` even if the issue is framed as "support X" or "add Y".

**3. Is it a design question or investigation?**
If the issue is asking *how* to do something, comparing approaches, measuring
capacity, or researching unknowns before any code is written, it is `kind/design`.
Keywords: "Design discussion", "Investigate", "Explore options", "Identify what",
"Measure", "Research".

The clearest way to distinguish `kind/design` from `kind/feature`:
- **`kind/feature`**: you could open a PR today — the *what* and *how* are known.
- **`kind/design`**: a decision or investigation must happen first; a PR cannot be written yet.

When in doubt, ask: *"Could someone reasonably start coding this issue right now?"*
If yes → `kind/feature`. If no → `kind/design`.

**4. Is it a code quality improvement with no behavior change?**
Refactoring, renaming, consolidating duplicated code, removing dead code → `kind/cleanup`.

**5. Is it documentation only?**
Docs fixes, missing API guide sections, README updates → `kind/docs`.

For `area/` labels, use the component the issue is *about*, not where the fix will
necessarily land. A bug in actor scheduling reported via the API is `area/api` +
`area/scheduling`, not `area/api-machinery`.

## Process

Steps 1–3 are read-only. Nothing is written to GitHub until the user approves the
proposal in Step 3.

### Step 1 — Check for missing labels

List the repo's labels and compare against the taxonomy above:

```bash
gh label list --repo agent-substrate/substrate --limit 100 --json name --jq '.[].name'
```

Do not create anything yet. If any taxonomy label is missing, list its creation in
the proposal.

### Step 2 — Fetch and classify issues

Fetch unlabeled issues first:

```bash
gh issue list --repo agent-substrate/substrate \
  --state open --limit 500 \
  --json number,title,labels,body \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.labels | length == 0)]'
```

Classify each one using the guide above. Then scan already-labeled issues for
obvious gaps:
- Issues with a `kind/` label but no `area/` label
- Issues with `area/` labels but no `kind/` label
- Issues that look like `kind/design` but are filed as `kind/feature`

Do not propose changes to labels that look reasonable even if you might have chosen
differently. Only correct clear mismatches (for example, a bug filed as
`kind/feature`, or a design discussion with no `kind/` label at all).

Only propose labels an issue does not already have, so the undo record in Step 4
removes exactly what this run added and nothing a human applied earlier.

### Step 3 — Present the proposal and wait for approval

Output a summary of every change you intend to make, then **stop and wait**. Do not
apply anything in the same turn as the proposal.

```
## Proposed changes

Labels to create: kind/design, area/benchmarking

| Issue | Title (truncated) | Labels to add |
|---|---|---|
| #900 | Implement chain of authenticator... | kind/feature, area/identity, area/api-machinery |
| #874 | Design discussion: WorkerPool vs... | kind/design, area/scheduling |

### Uncertain (best guess included above, please confirm)
- #812 — could be kind/bug or kind/design: unclear whether the behavior is intended.

Reply to approve all, or list the issue numbers to change or skip.
```

List every uncertain issue with the question you could not resolve from the text
alone. Do not leave those out of the proposal — include your best guess and flag it.

If the user asks for corrections, update the proposal and confirm again. Apply only
what the user approved.

### Step 4 — Apply approved changes and record the undo

Create any approved missing labels with the `gh label create` command above, then
apply labels to each approved issue:

```bash
gh issue edit <number> \
  --repo agent-substrate/substrate \
  --add-label "kind/bug,area/network"
```

Use `--add-label`, not `--label`, so you don't overwrite existing labels.

As you apply, build an undo script at `/tmp/triage-issues-undo-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.sh`
containing one line per successfully applied change, reversing it:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Undo record for triage-issues run on 2026-09-04 14:03 UTC.
# Removes only the labels this run added; labels applied by humans are untouched.
set -euo pipefail
gh issue edit 900 --repo agent-substrate/substrate --remove-label "kind/feature,area/identity,area/api-machinery"
gh issue edit 874 --repo agent-substrate/substrate --remove-label "kind/design,area/scheduling"
# Label deletions must come last: deleting a label strips it from all issues.
# Only present if this run created the label.
gh label delete "kind/design" --repo agent-substrate/substrate --yes
```

Rules for the undo script:
- Record only changes that actually succeeded, not the full proposal.
- Include a `--remove-label` line per issue listing exactly the labels this run added.
- Include `gh label delete` only for labels this run created, and place those lines
  after all `--remove-label` lines.
- Make it executable: `chmod +x <script>`.

### Step 5 — Report

After applying, output a table of what was actually done:

```
| Issue | Title (truncated) | Labels applied |
|---|---|---|
| #900 | Implement chain of authenticator... | kind/feature, area/identity, area/api-machinery |
```

Note any approved changes that failed to apply. Then point at the undo record:

```
To undo everything this run changed:
  bash /tmp/triage-issues-undo-20260904-140312.sh
```

## Classification examples

These illustrate the taxonomy applied to real issues in this repo:

| Title pattern | `kind/` | `area/` |
|---|---|---|
| "X is broken / returns wrong value / panics" | bug | affected component |
| "Add support for X / Implement Y" | feature | affected component |
| "Design discussion: should X or Y" | design | affected component |
| "Identify what metrics to use for Z" | design | observability, scheduling |
| "Measure / benchmark X capacity" | design | benchmarking, affected component |
| "Consolidate / Reorganize / Rework X" | cleanup | affected component |
| "Update docs / Add doc for X" | docs | (omit area unless specific) |
| "E2E test flaky: TestFoo" | bug | tests, affected component |
| "Presubmit doesn't catch X" | bug | dev-infra |

---

## Notes

- An issue can have multiple `area/` labels. Apply all that fit.
- A single `kind/` label per issue is the norm. Applying two is unusual.
- Do not add `prio/` labels to issues that don't clearly warrant one. Unlabeled
  priority is better than a wrong priority label.
- Never remove a label a human applied. If you think it is wrong, note it in your
  report and let a maintainer decide.
