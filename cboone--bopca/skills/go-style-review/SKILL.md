# Go Style Review

## Core Principles

1. **Clarity over cleverness** - Code should be obvious to readers
2. **Simplicity** - Accomplish goals in the most straightforward way
3. **Consistency** - Match surrounding code and project conventions
4. **Minimal indentation** - Handle errors early, keep happy path unindented

## Workflow

1. Run automated checks (`make lint`, `make fmt` or `gofmt`, `goimports`)
2. Review against essential checklist: `references/essential/checklist.md`
3. For specific questions, consult: `references/comprehensive/{topic}.md`

## Reference Navigation

**Quick reviews (default):**

- `references/essential/checklist.md` - Condensed, actionable rules

**Deep dives by topic:**

- `references/comprehensive/naming.md` - Package names, identifiers, receivers
- `references/comprehensive/errors.md` - Error handling, panic/recover
- `references/comprehensive/concurrency.md` - Goroutines, channels, context
- `references/comprehensive/testing.md` - Test quality and patterns
- `references/comprehensive/code-organization.md` - Imports, packages, structure
- `references/comprehensive/data-types.md` - new vs make, slices, maps
- `references/comprehensive/functions.md` - Multiple returns, defer
- `references/comprehensive/interfaces.md` - Embedding, type assertions
