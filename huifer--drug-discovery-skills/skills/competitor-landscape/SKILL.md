## 3. Pipeline by Development Phase

### Phase III
| Drug | Company | Differentiation | Readout |
|------|---------|----------------|---------|
| Lazertinib | Yuhan/J&J | 3rd-gen, WT sparing | 2024 H2 |
| Nazartinib | Novartis | CNS active | 2024 Q3 |
| Patritumab deruxtecan | Daiichi Sankyo | ADC | 2025 |

### Phase II
| Drug | Company | Mechanism | Novelty |
|------|---------|-----------|---------|
| BLU-945 | Blueprint | 4th-gen (C797S) | First-in-class |
| BPI-9016M | Betta | 4th-gen | C797S focus |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## 4. Mechanism of Action Classification

| Class | Count | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1st-gen TKI | 3 approved | Generic |
| 2nd-gen TKI | 2 approved | Mature |
| 3rd-gen TKI | 3 approved | Dominant |
| 4th-gen TKI | 5 in clinic | Emerging |
| Antibodies | 4 approved | Niche |
| Bispecifics | 3 in clinic | Emerging |
| ADCs | 4 in clinic | Hot area |

## 5. Key Development Trends

### 2023-2024 Trends
1. **4th-generation TKIs**: Focus on C797S resistance mutation
2. **CNS penetration**: Critical for brain mets
3. **Combination therapies**: EGFR + MET, EGFR + chemotherapy
4. **ADC approach**: HER3-ADC, MET-ADC combinations
5. **Bispecifics**: Amivantamab leading

### White Space Opportunities
| Area | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| 4th-gen TKI | C797S mutation unaddressed |
| Brain mets | High unmet need |
| Early detection | Neoadjuvant setting |
| Resistance combo | MET amp, HER3 upregulation |

## 6. Company Profiles

### AstraZeneca (Market Leader)
- **Portfolio**: Osimertinib (core), Tagrisso + chemoprev (adjuvant)
- **Strategy**: Extend osimertinib lifecycle (adjuvant, combo)
- **Strengths**: First-mover, brand recognition
- **Weaknesses**: Patent cliff approaching

### Emerging Players
- **Blueprint Medicines**: 4th-gen TKI leader (BLU-945)
- **J&J**: Combo strategy (lazertinib + EGFR/c-MET bispecific)
- **Daiichi Sankyo**: ADC approach (patritumab deruxtecan)

## 7. Investment & Deals (Recent)

| Deal | Type | Value | Year |
|------|------|-------|------|
| J&J / Yuhan | Licensing | $1.2B | 2018 |
| Merck / Daiichi Sankyo | Combo partnership | $4.5B | 2023 |
| BMS / Turning Point | Acquisition | $4.1B | 2023 |

## 8. Go/No-Go Considerations

### Green Light Signals
- C797S mutation space open
- CNS penetration unmet
- Combination approaches working

### Red Light Signals
- 3rd-gen crowded
- Generic erosion (1st/2nd gen)
- High clinical trial costs

### Yellow Light Signals
- 4th-gen clinical risk (first-in-class)
- Combination regulatory complexity
```

## Examples

### Drug Class Analysis
```
/competitor EGFR TKIs
/competitor GLP-1R agonists
/competitor PCSK9 inhibitors
```

### Disease Area Analysis
```
/competitor NSCLC therapies
Compare Alzheimer's drugs in development
/competitor obesity medications --phase 2-3
```

### Company Portfolio
```
What is AstraZeneca's oncology pipeline?
Compare Roche vs Novartis in hematology
/competitor "Company Name" portfolio
```

### Mechanism Focus
```
/competitor KRAS G12C inhibitors
Compare all PROTAC degraders in clinic
/competitor antibody-drug conjugates
```

## Running Scripts

```bash
# Fetch competitive landscape data
python scripts/fetch_competitor_data.py "EGFR inhibitors" --output data.json

# Include clinical trials
python scripts/fetch_competitor_data.py "KRAS" --clinical-trials -o full.json

# Company-specific
python scripts/fetch_competitor_data.py --company "AstraZeneca" --indication oncology
```

## Requirements

```bash
pip install requests pandas lxml
```

## Additional Resources

- [ChEMBL API Reference](reference/chembl-api.md)
- [Competitive Analysis Framework](reference/analysis-framework.md)
- [Company Data Sources](reference/company-data.md)

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific**: Use drug class names (e.g., "3rd-gen EGFR TKI")
2. **Define scope**: Specify indication, phase, or company
3. **Compare**: Ask for competitive positioning
4. **Look for white space**: Ask about unaddressed areas

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Too broad | Specify drug class or indication |
| Missing context | Include disease area |
| Outdated pipeline | Check date of data |
| Public vs private | Public sources only |
