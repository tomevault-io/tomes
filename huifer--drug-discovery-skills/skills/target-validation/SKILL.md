| Competition | High | Differentiate on resistance |
| IP | Medium | Novel chemical series |

## Recommendation

**Go/No-Go**: GO - Proceed with EGFR program

**Rationale**:
- Strong genetic validation
- Proven clinical mechanism
- Tractable target
- Large market despite competition

**Strategy**:
- Focus on resistance mutations (C797S)
- Combination approaches
- CNS-penetrant molecules

**Priority Actions**:
1. Review 4th-gen competitive landscape
2. Assess CNS penetration opportunity
3. Evaluate combination strategies

## Validation Scoring

### Genetic Evidence (0-5)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Definitive causal link (Mendelian) |
| 4 | Strong GWAS + functional validation |
| 3 | GWAS association only |
| 2 | Moderate association |
| 1 | Weak genetic evidence |
| 0 | No genetic evidence |

### Chemical Evidence (0-5)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Multiple drug classes, many binders |
| 4 | Several binders, good SAR |
| 3 | Some binders, limited SAR |
| 2 | Few tool compounds |
| 1 | Probes only |
| 0 | No chemical matter |

### Clinical Evidence (0-5)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Multiple approved drugs |
| 4 | One approved, others in pipeline |
| 3 | Late-stage pipeline |
| 2 | Early clinical evidence |
| 1 | Preclinical only |
| 0 | No clinical evidence |

## Running Scripts

```bash
# Full validation
python scripts/target_validation.py EGFR --full

# Association analysis only
python scripts/target_validation.py KRAS --association oncology

# Tractability assessment
python scripts/tractability.py --target "BCR-ABL" --structure

# Comparison
python scripts/target_validation.py EGFR KRAS ALK --compare
```

## Requirements

```bash
pip install requests pandas numpy

# Optional for advanced features
pip install scipy statsmodels
```

## Reference

- [reference/validation-methods.md](reference/validation-methods.md) - Validation methodology
- [reference/genetics.md](reference/genetics.md) - Genetic validation reference
- [reference/tractability.md](reference/tractability.md) - Tractability assessment

## Best Practices

1. **Use multiple evidence types**: No single source sufficient
2. **Weight clinical highest**: Approved drugs = strongest validation
3. **Consider disease**: Oncology targets different from CNS
4. **Assess timing**: Early targets = higher risk/reward
5. **Review competition**: Impacts differentiation strategy

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Over-reliance on expression | Functional validation needed |
| Ignoring genetics | Human genetics predicts clinical success |
| Late to crowded targets | Early differentiation key |
| Undervaluing safety | Safety failures expensive |
| Single-source bias | Triangulate evidence
