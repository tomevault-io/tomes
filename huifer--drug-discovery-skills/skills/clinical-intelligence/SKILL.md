# Clinical Trial Analysis: NCT03704547

## Executive Summary
FLAURA2 study evaluating osimertinib ± chemotherapy in first-line
EGFR-mutated NSCLC. **Status**: Active, not recruiting. **Results**: Positive PFS benefit.

## Trial Overview
| Field | Value |

## Site Distribution
| Region | Sites | Patients |
|--------|-------|----------|
| North America | 45 | 180 |
| Europe | 60 | 210 |
| Asia Pacific | 45 | 167 |
```

## Examples

### Trial Lookup
```
/clinical NCT03704547
/clinical-intelligence NCT01234567
```

### By Target/Drug
```
/clinical EGFR trials --phase 3
/clinical "sotorasib" studies
Analyze all KRAS G12C clinical trials
```

### Competitive Analysis
```
Compare osimertinib trials vs competitors
/clinical NSCLC --company AstraZeneca
Map phase III trials in EGFR-mutated NSCLC
```

### Enrollment Analysis
```
/clinical NCT03704547 --focus enrollment
Compare enrollment rates across similar trials
Analyze site distribution for KRAS trials
```

## Running Scripts

```bash
# Fetch trial data
python scripts/fetch_trial_data.py NCT03704547 --output trial.json

# Search for trials by condition
python scripts/fetch_trial_data.py --condition "NSCLC" --phase 3 -o results.json

# Search by drug/intervention
python scripts/fetch_trial_data.py --intervention osimertinib -o osimertinib.json

# Competitive trial mapping
python scripts/fetch_trial_data.py --target EGFR --phase 2-3 --map-competition
```

## Requirements

```bash
pip install requests pandas
```

## Additional Resources

- [ClinicalTrials.gov API](reference/clinicaltrials-api.md)
- [Trial Fields Reference](reference/trial-fields.md)
- [FDA Database Links](reference/fda-resources.md)

## Best Practices

1. **Use NCT ID**: Most precise way to look up trials
2. **Specify phase**: Narrow down to relevant trials
3. **Check status**: Trials may be terminated/suspended
4. **Verify enrollment**: Actual vs target enrollment matters
5. **Cross-reference**: Check publications for results

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Too many results | Add phase, status, or date filters |
| Outdated status | Trial status changes, verify current |
| Missing results | Results may be in publications only |
| Duplicate trials | Same study may have multiple NCTs |
| Terminated trials | Check why before analysis |
