name: review-change
description: Review a pull request, branch or working diff in this repo the way its history says it needs reviewing - score its risk and blast radius per platform, check the areas that have broken before (CSS against Chrome, invalidation, absent native modules, async ordering, generators on real workspaces), make sure tests bite and coverage holds, that breaking changes have a version plan and a migration, that new APIs match their siblings and React Native or Expo, and that nothing duplicates code the repo already has. Every finding is verified and graded low, medium, high or critical. Use when asked to review a PR, a branch or a diff, or before opening or merging one. Use when this capability is needed.

# Review a change

Read [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md), [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md),
[CONTEXT.md](../../../docs/CONTEXT.md) and [.claude/rules/angular.md](../../rules/angular.md) first. A
fresh worktree has no `node_modules`: run `pnpm install` before running anything.

## 1. Get the change, cheaply

GitHub rate-limits this repo's automation, so fetch once:

- A PR: `gh pr view <n> --json title,body,baseRefName,headRefName,files` and `gh pr diff <n>`. Check
  it out with `gh pr checkout <n>` only when you will run tests.
- A branch: `git diff origin/main...HEAD`. A working tree: `git diff HEAD`.

Read every changed file in full, not just the hunks, and the callers of anything whose behaviour
changed (`git grep`). Read the PR body: what it claims is what you check.

## 2. Score the risk

Before hunting for bugs, say what a mistake here could break and for whom.

| Surface                         | Touched by                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| iOS (16.4+)                     | `fabric`, `platform`, `components`, `router`, `expo`, `device`, native targets |
| Android (minSdk 24)             | the same, plus anything with an Android-only branch or Compose view            |
| Web host                        | `web`, the web preset in `tailwind`, `*.web.*` files, `browser` exports        |
| Build (Metro, Tailwind, Hermes) | `metro`, `tailwind`, the Angular transform, release bundles                    |
| Workspaces (generators, update) | `nx`, `schematics`, `migrate`, `template`, `package.json` exports and peers    |
| Repo only                       | tests, CI, scripts, `.claude`, `docs/`                                         |

For each surface the change reaches, give a **blast radius**: `none`, `narrow` (one API or one
property, opt-in), `wide` (every app using a package, or a default) or `all` (every app: the engine
commit, the CSS compiler, `mount`, the template, a generator's default output). Then an overall
**risk**: low, medium, high or critical, from the widest radius and how silent a failure would be.
A change that can fail silently (the CSS engine dropping a declaration, `<View>` compiling to an
empty template, a migration skipping a file) rates one level higher than its radius alone.

Platforms are reviewed separately: a change can be low risk on iOS and high on Android.

## 3. Check what has broken before

Every item here is a class of bug a past review caught. Check each one that applies to the diff.

**CSS compiler and engine (`packages/metro/css`, `packages/fabric`).** Chrome is the reference, not
intuition. Check:

- both paths: a declaration in a sheet and the same value set on an element (inline or bound), and
  that they agree;
- `var()` fallbacks, alias chains (`--a: var(--b)`), derived tokens settled in any declaration order,
  cycles, and a token that is unset;
- `calc()` keeping its dimension (a unitless number is not a length) through nested `calc()`;
- CSS whitespace, not `trim()` (U+00A0 is not whitespace), escapes and line continuations in strings;
- shorthands: a duplicate part invalidates the declaration, an omitted part resets to its initial
  value, a later longhand still wins, and `!important` beats a normal declaration;
- out-of-range values clamped the way CSS clamps them;
- a refusal is a warning, never a silent drop. Test-first is required here: the test pinning the
  behaviour must exist and fail without the change, with a Chrome oracle row where one applies.

**Derived and cached state.** Most "major" findings were stale state. For every cache, registry,
memo or `computed` the change adds or relies on, ask what invalidates it, and check both directions:
the input changes, and the input goes away. Past cases: a text prop not marked dirty when a child
came and went, keyframes and global sheets never removed on HMR, scroll tracks keeping an old
inherited colour, a font face added after a text resolved, an angle kept after its hinge vanished,
a list warning not rechecked when `items` changed. Tests should add then remove.

**Native modules and devices (`packages/expo`, `packages/device`).**

- The module absent (Expo Go, web, Node tests), and the module present with a method absent: call
  methods with `?.()`, and never `TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing` at import time.
- A stand-in returned when the module is absent has every method callers use.
- Validation runs before the availability check, so Node tests still see errors.
- Debug versus release: nothing dev-only (reload, Fast Refresh, `ngDevMode` branches) reachable in a
  release build.
- OS floors: iOS 16.4 and Android API 24. An API newer than the floor is gated, and the docs say so.
- Permissions: denied, restricted and never-asked all answer, and none throw.

**Async ordering and errors.** Two events before the next change-detection pass (a signal `set`
keeps only the last, so queue deliveries), a value that changes while a sync awaits (write the
latest after it), a session not yet active, a rejected promise with no handler, one throwing
listener or `ngOnDestroy` stopping the rest. Each listener and teardown is isolated, and a failure
reaches `ErrorHandler`.

**Components, router and accessibility.** Compare with React Native's own source in `node_modules`
for the version the repo pins (each of `Pressable`, `TouchableOpacity`, `Text`, `Switch` differs),
and with `react-native-screens` for navigation. Roles, disabled state and what a screen reader
announces should match React Native. Divergence that makes one platform refuse more than the other
is a finding.

**Generators, migrations and installs (`nx`, `schematics`, `migrate`, `template`).** Real workspaces
are messier than the fixture: `angular.json` with comments and trailing commas (use `tree.readJson`),
YAML edited by structure not by text, `"type": "module"` packages, `options.commands` arrays,
`extends` and path aliases inherited from a base tsconfig, semver ranges with prerelease suffixes,
identifiers that are Kotlin or Java keywords, npm, yarn and bun as well as pnpm, and running the
generator twice. Migrations must respect scope: a name shadowed by a local declaration or a template
`@let` is not rewritten.

**Packaging.** Export-map condition order (`browser` before `types` when the types differ), an
optional peer that leaks into published `.d.ts`, a dependency the package uses but does not declare,
a second copy of `@angular/core` or a native module.

**Scripts and CI.** Fail closed: a failed `gh` call, a truncated page (`--paginate`, or GitHub's 300
and 3,000-file caps) or a rate limit must never read as "nothing to do". Bind merges to the checked
head SHA. Concurrency groups must not let one event cancel another's run.

**Docs.** Every claim is checked against the code: docs that overstate (say "every" when the code
covers some), drift from what the code does, or leave out a platform qualifier were the most common
documentation findings. Docs describe present behaviour, in [CONTEXT.md](../../../docs/CONTEXT.md)'s
words. A code sample in docs is covered by `docs-samples.test.ts`.

## 4. Check the cross-cutting rules

**Tests bite.** For each fix or behaviour, revert just the change and run its test: it must fail, for
that reason. Reject tests that cannot fail:

- the assertion is satisfied without the code under test (a single token excused by another rule,
  an object compared with itself, a value no input can change);
- the test bypasses the default path it claims to cover (calls a helper the default would call);
- the title promises a case the body never exercises;
- tests sharing mutable state that only pass in file order;
- an implementation detail is asserted where the committed props or rendered output would do.

Tests that change globals, temp directories, CDP sessions or registered names restore them in
`finally`. Run `pnpm coverage` (95% floor) when product code changed.

**No regressions.** `pnpm affected` for lint, typecheck and test. For the CSS engine, also the Chrome
oracle corpus and both Tailwind sweeps; for Metro, CSS or example styles, `pnpm export`. Read each
fixture or snapshot change in the diff: every changed line is a behaviour change that needs a reason.

**Performance.** The engine runs per commit and the CSS engine per node, so look for work added on
those paths: allocation per commit, a walk of the whole tree, a style resolve that no longer
short-circuits, a commit when nothing changed (at most one per change-detection pass). Run
`pnpm --filter @ng-native/integration-tests bench` (or `bench:tailwind`, `bench:screens`) on main and
on the branch when the engine, CSS or components changed, and report both numbers. A new runtime
dependency, or dev-only code not behind `ngDevMode`, is bundle size on every app.

**Breaking changes.** A change someone using the packages would notice needs a version plan: removed
or renamed exports, inputs, outputs or element names, a changed default, different CSS output,
different generated files, different announcements or query results. Under `0.x` a breaking change is
`minor`, and the plan says plainly what breaks and what to do. When the change an app must make is
mechanical (a moved import, a renamed member, a method that became a property), it needs a migration
in `packages/migrate`, registered in all three `migrations.json` files at the release version and
tested with `acrossAdapters`; the plan names it and links Updating an app. When it cannot be
automated, the migration leaves a note with the file and line. A version plan has no heading and its
first line is one unwrapped sentence; never ask for a heading.

**Reuse before adding.** For every new helper, check the repo already lacks it: `git grep` for the
operation, not the name (parsing a CSS token, resolving a package root, reading a JSONC file, a
stand-in for an absent module, temp-directory cleanup in tests). A second copy of an existing helper
is a finding even when the copy is correct.

**Slop and simplicity.** Findings, each with what to cut: comments that narrate the code or the
change; defensive code for states the types rule out; a `try`/`catch` that swallows; an option,
parameter or abstraction with one caller and no second in sight; a wrapper that only forwards;
re-implemented stdlib or Angular (`computed`, `linkedSignal`, `DestroyRef`); names outside the
CONTEXT.md vocabulary; anything the Angular rules forbid (decorators, `standalone: true`, explicit
`OnPush`, `@HostBinding`, constructor injection).

**API consistency.** A new public API is compared with its closest siblings in the same package and
should read as one of them: signals for state (`available`, `error`), the same shape for permissions,
stand-ins and errors routed to `ErrorHandler`, kebab-case lowercase element names, `input()` names
that match React Native's prop where one exists. Then compare it with the React Native or Expo
equivalent. A divergence must be deliberate and documented; an accidental one (a different default,
a missing platform, an option Expo has that this lacks for no reason) is a finding.

**Security.** Shell commands built from input (quote, or pass through variables), secrets in logs or
fixtures, `eval` or `new Function` (Hermes has no local `eval`), and URL or deep-link input trusted
without checking.

## 5. Verify every finding

A finding is reported only when it names a concrete input and the wrong result. Then verify it:

- **Confirmed:** reproduced, by a failing test or script, by running the tool, or by quoting the
  line of the reference source (Chrome's result, React Native's or Expo's source in `node_modules`)
  that contradicts the change.
- **Plausible:** the reasoning holds but could not be reproduced here (device-only, needs a release
  build). Say what would confirm it.

Drop anything that is neither. Before reporting, try to argue each finding away: is the case
reachable from public API, is it already handled elsewhere, does the repo deliberately diverge
(version plans without headings, `npx expo install` in user-facing setup instructions, behaviour
matching React Native over the web)?

For a large diff, at most three `sonnet` agents can verify findings in parallel, one area each. Do
the review itself directly.

## 6. Grade and report

| Severity | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| critical | A crash, a broken build or release, data loss, a security hole, or an architecture rule broken, on a supported platform in a common path.                                                                              |
| high     | Wrong behaviour in a common path, a regression of shipped behaviour, a breaking change without a version plan or migration, a test that cannot fail guarding the change.                                               |
| medium   | Wrong behaviour in an edge case, a platform or OS version not handled, a measurable performance regression, missing coverage for a branch, a stale cache on a less common path, an API inconsistent with its siblings. |
| low      | Docs wording or accuracy in a corner, naming, slop, duplication of a small helper, a missing test for a trivial branch.                                                                                                |

Report, in this order:

1. **Risk:** overall level and one line on why, then each touched surface with its blast radius.
2. **Findings**, most severe first. Each: severity, confirmed or plausible, `file:line`, the input
   and wrong result, how it was verified, and the fix in one line.
3. **Checks run** and their results, including bench numbers and which tests were reverted to prove
   they bite. Say plainly what was not run.
4. **Version plan and migration:** present and right, missing, or not needed, with the reason.
