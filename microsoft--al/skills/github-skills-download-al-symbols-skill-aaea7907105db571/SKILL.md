name: download-al-symbols
description: Downloads exact Business Central symbol packages for a temporary AL reproduction project through the installed prerelease ALTool. Use before compiling any project whose app.json references platform, application, or dependency packages. Use when this capability is needed.

Run the deterministic wrapper:

```powershell
& .\.github\skills\download-al-symbols\Invoke-DownloadAlSymbols.ps1 `
    -ProjectPath <project-folder>
```

The wrapper uses only the prerelease ALTool installed by the workflow at `ALTOOL_PATH`. It invokes
ALTool's symbol-download capability non-interactively with the sandbox connection, tenant, and
credentials provided by the workflow, writes packages to `<project>\.alpackages`, and fails unless
at least one package is present.

For symbol download, do not invoke `alc.exe`, launch or script an MCP server yourself, or call
`/dev/packages` directly. Use `run-al-mcp-tool` separately when the issue itself concerns an MCP
tool. After the wrapper succeeds, compile through ALTool and pass the populated `.alpackages` path.
