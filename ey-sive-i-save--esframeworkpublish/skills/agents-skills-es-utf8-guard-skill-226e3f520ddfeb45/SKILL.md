description: Validate ESFramework text changes for strict UTF-8 decoding, Unicode replacement characters, likely mojibake, unintended broad rewrites, and git diff integrity. Use before or after editing Chinese source, Markdown, JSON, YAML, CSV, shaders, or scripts in the ES project. Use when this capability is needed.

## Verification boundary

- **Static**: source, configuration, contracts, hashes, and deterministic scripts.
- **Runtime**: Unity, process, display, timing, layout-engine, or serialization behavior.
- `runtime-not-run` means runtime evidence is absent; it does not mean Static failed. It blocks only the selected RuntimeAcceptance/ReleaseAcceptance profile.
- Details: `.agents/skills/es-skill-governance/references/verification-semantics.md`

# Guard ES UTF-8 Text

## Resource composition

- Load the [Skill Resource Index](../../SKILL_RESOURCE_INDEX.yaml) before selecting references, scripts, MCP capabilities, or evidence.
- Read [the evidence receipt contract](references/evidence-receipt-contract.md) and run [the evidence validator](scripts/Test-ESSkillEvidence.ps1) against every execution receipt.
- MCP is optional and capability visibility never grants AI-initiated authority. The current explicit user request authorizes its bounded action under `.agents/skills/es-skill-governance/references/user-directed-action-authority.md`; AIBrain, AICommand and TaskContract are protocol inputs only when their managed channel is selected. Reject inferred expansion, not user-directed paths.

## Execution classification

- Strict UTF-8 decoding, replacement-character scans, mojibake review, and `git diff --check` are read-only checks and may run directly.
- A current user request may modify any project text needed for its bounded goal, including source and governance. `Test-ESUserDirectedLowRiskPolicy.ps1` is a scope-closure aid, not a prerequisite or path allowlist; use `apply_patch` and preserve unrelated bytes.
- Delete, rename, Git, Unity/Runtime, external-process, network, release and credential actions require action-specific user wording; managed-channel plans and contracts are transport requirements only.
- Keep the low-risk path distinct from missing capabilities; neither permits silently widening the requested scope.

Use this skill for every task that modifies project text, especially files containing Chinese.

## Workflow

1. Read the P0 UTF-8 warning under `AIWarnings/10_P0最高约束（P0Guardrails）/编码与文本（Encoding）`.
2. Prefer `apply_patch` for targeted edits. Never read with a default code page and overwrite the original.
3. Run `scripts/Test-ESUtf8.ps1 -ProjectRoot <root>` after editing. Pass `-Path` to limit validation to known files when appropriate.
4. Review every suspicious mojibake hit manually. Do not bulk transcode or delete text based only on a marker.
5. Inspect the target diff for unexpected whole-file rewrites or line-ending drift.

## Exit codes

- `0`: strict decoding, replacement-character scan, suspicious-marker scan, and `git diff --check` passed.
- `1`: invalid UTF-8, U+FFFD, missing target, or diff-check error.
- `2`: suspicious mojibake requires manual review.

## Rules

- Never use `Get-Content file | Set-Content file` on project text.
- Never use `-Encoding Default`, ANSI, or mechanical GBK/UTF-8 conversion.
- Preserve BOM and line endings unless the task explicitly changes them.
- Repair only text whose intended content can be proven from source, history, or adjacent semantics.

## SmallTool controls

- **Scope**: read only the project root or explicit `-Path` targets; never traverse credentials, external caches or unrelated repositories.
- **Side effects**: validation is read-only. A detected encoding issue does not authorize conversion, deletion or whole-file rewrite.
- **Bounded scale**: prefer changed/target files; declare a file-count or root boundary for repository-wide scans. Stop on invalid UTF-8, unsafe target resolution or undecidable mojibake.
- **Repeatability**: identical bytes produce the same classification. File changes invalidate earlier results; concurrent writes require a fresh scan.
- **Required cases**: valid UTF-8, invalid byte sequence, U+FFFD/suspicious marker, denied conversion request and repeated unchanged scan.


## Specialized static acceptance

Acceptance ID: `utf8-integrity`

Responsibility-specific static assertions (these are source-level requirements, not Runtime claims):
- UTF-8
- strict
- BOM
- invalid byte
- roundtrip

Required specialized cases: `strict-decode, bom-policy, invalid-byte, roundtrip-hash, powershell-write-safety`
Guidance: `references/static-specialized-acceptance.md`
