Determine where execution stands and either continue or report blockers.

## Workflow

Copy this checklist and track progress:

```
Go Progress:
- [ ] Detect context (greenfield plan vs feature directory)
- [ ] Check for execution plan
- [ ] Read phase state
- [ ] Determine next action
- [ ] Execute or report blockers
```

## Context Detection

Determine working context:

1. If current working directory matches pattern `*/features/*`:
   - PROJECT_ROOT = parent of parent of CWD (e.g., `/project/features/foo` → `/project`)
   - FEATURE_DIR = CWD
   - MODE = "feature"

2. If current working directory matches pattern `*/plans/greenfield*`:
   - PROJECT_ROOT = parent of parent of CWD (e.g., `/project/plans/greenfield` → `/project`)
   - MODE = "greenfield"

3. Otherwise:
   - PROJECT_ROOT = current working directory
   - MODE = "greenfield-legacy"

## Step 1: Check for Execution Plan

Check if `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` exists in the current working directory (or FEATURE_DIR if feature mode).

**If no EXECUTION_PLAN.md:**

Check if this is the toolkit repo (e.g., `.toolkit-marker` exists in CWD):

```
NO EXECUTION PLAN
=================

You're in the toolkit repo, not a project directory.

To start a new project:
  1. /generate-plan <project-path>    (greenfield project)
  2. cd <project-path>
  3. /go

To add a feature to an existing project:
  1. /feature-plan <feature-name>     (from the project directory)
  2. cd features/<feature-name>
  3. /go
```

If NOT in the toolkit repo:

```
NO EXECUTION PLAN
=================

No EXECUTION_PLAN.md found in this directory.

If this project uses the scoped greenfield layout and `plans/greenfield/EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
exists here, run:
  cd plans/greenfield
  /go

Options:
  - If you have specs ready: Run /generate-plan from the toolkit repo
  - If this is a feature: cd features/<name> and try again
  - If you need specs first: Run /product-spec then /technical-spec
```

**Stop here** if no execution plan found.

## Step 2: Read Phase State

Read `.claude/phase-state.json` from PROJECT_ROOT (or FEATURE_DIR if feature mode).

Also read `EXECUTION_PLAN.md` to determine total phase count and current checkbox state.

### Parse Phase Count

Count the number of `## Phase N:` headers in EXECUTION_PLAN.md to determine TOTAL_PHASES.

### Parse State

If `phase-state.json` exists and is valid JSON with a `main` key:
- CURRENT_PHASE = `main.current_phase`
- PHASE_STATUS = status of the current phase from `main.phases[]`
- Check for in-progress tasks, blocked tasks, and failure counts

If `phase-state.json` does not exist or is invalid:
- STATE_EXISTS = false

## Step 3: Determine Next Action

Walk through these conditions **in order**. Take the FIRST match:

### Case A: No Phase State — First Run

**Condition:** `phase-state.json` doesn't exist or is invalid.

**Action:** Invoke `/fresh-start` using the Skill tool.

```
STARTING EXECUTION
==================
No prior state found. Running /fresh-start...
```

### Case B: Phase In Progress — Tasks Remaining

**Condition:** State exists. Current phase status is `IN_PROGRESS`. There are tasks in EXECUTION_PLAN.md for that phase with unchecked `- [ ]` acceptance criteria.

**Action:** Invoke `/phase-start {CURRENT_PHASE}` using the Skill tool. Phase-start handles resumption — it skips already-completed tasks.

```
RESUMING EXECUTION
==================
Phase {CURRENT_PHASE} in progress. Resuming...
{If a specific task was IN_PROGRESS in state: "Continuing from Task {id}"}
```

### Case C: Phase Tasks Complete — Needs Checkpoint

**Condition:** State exists. Current phase status is `IN_PROGRESS` or `COMPLETE`. ALL task acceptance criteria for the current phase are checked `[x]` in EXECUTION_PLAN.md. But phase status is NOT `CHECKPOINTED`.

**Action:** Invoke `/phase-checkpoint {CURRENT_PHASE}` using the Skill tool.

```
RUNNING CHECKPOINT
==================
All Phase {CURRENT_PHASE} tasks complete. Running quality gates...
```

### Case D: Phase Checkpointed — More Phases Exist

**Condition:** State exists. Current phase status is `CHECKPOINTED`. CURRENT_PHASE < TOTAL_PHASES.

**Action:** Invoke `/phase-prep {CURRENT_PHASE + 1}` using the Skill tool.

```
ADVANCING TO NEXT PHASE
========================
Phase {CURRENT_PHASE} checkpointed. Preparing Phase {CURRENT_PHASE + 1}...
```

### Case E: All Phases Complete

**Condition:** State exists. CURRENT_PHASE >= TOTAL_PHASES. Current phase status is `CHECKPOINTED` or `COMPLETE`.

**Action:** Check deferred review queue, then report completion.

1. Read `.claude/deferred-reviews.json`
2. Read `autoAdvance.drainOnCompletion` from `.claude/settings.local.json` (default: true)
3. If queue is non-empty (has `reviewed: false` items) AND `drainOnCompletion` is true:

```
PROJECT COMPLETE — DEFERRED REVIEW
===================================
All {TOTAL_PHASES} phases finished.

{N} items were deferred during execution.
These are non-blocking items that need human review:

Phase 1:
- [ ] "{criterion}" (Task {id})
  Context: {file}:{line} — {summary}

Phase 3:
- [ ] "{criterion}" (Task {id})
  Context: {file}:{line} — {summary}
```

Use AskUserQuestion:
- "All look good" → Clear queue (set all `reviewed: true`, remove reviewed items, update `last_drained`/`last_drain_reason`)
- "Review individually" → Invoke `/review-deferred`
- "Skip for now" → Keep queue, note in session

1. If queue is non-empty but `drainOnCompletion` is false:

```
EXECUTION COMPLETE
==================
All {TOTAL_PHASES} phases finished.

Note: {N} deferred review items remain in queue.
Use /review-deferred to review them when ready.

Summary:
- Phases completed: {TOTAL_PHASES}/{TOTAL_PHASES}
- Total tasks: {count from EXECUTION_PLAN.md}
- Deferred items: {N} pending review
```

1. If queue is empty or file doesn't exist:

```
EXECUTION COMPLETE
==================
All {TOTAL_PHASES} phases finished. All criteria verified. No deferred items.

Summary:
- Phases completed: {TOTAL_PHASES}/{TOTAL_PHASES}
- Total tasks: {count from EXECUTION_PLAN.md}

Consider:
- /progress              — Full completion report
- Review DEFERRED.md     — Any deferred requirements
- Review TODOS.md        — Follow-up work
```

### Case F: Blocked

**Condition:** State exists. Current phase has a task with status `BLOCKED`, or the phase itself is `BLOCKED`.

Check failure tracking in phase-state.json for blocked tasks.

Also check `.claude/deferred-reviews.json` — if the deferred queue has items and
`autoAdvance.drainOnBlocker` is true, present them: "While you're here, {N} deferred
items are pending review."

```
EXECUTION BLOCKED
=================
Phase {CURRENT_PHASE} is blocked.

{For each blocked task:}
Task {id}: {task subject from EXECUTION_PLAN.md}
  Consecutive failures: {count}
  Last errors:
    - {error 1}
    - {error 2}

{If deferred queue has items:}
While you're here, {N} deferred review items are pending:
- "{criterion}" (Task {id}) — {reason}
Use /review-deferred to review them now.
{/If}

Options:
  1. Fix the issue and run /go again
  2. /phase-start {CURRENT_PHASE}     — Retry from current task
  3. Edit EXECUTION_PLAN.md           — Modify blocked criteria
```

### Case G: Ambiguous State

**Condition:** None of the above cases matched (e.g., state file is partially written, phases array is empty, status is unrecognized).

**Action:** Offer to rebuild state.

```
STATE UNCLEAR
=============
phase-state.json exists but state is ambiguous.

Options:
  1. /populate-state      — Rebuild state from EXECUTION_PLAN.md + git history
  2. /fresh-start         — Start fresh (preserves git history)
  3. /progress            — Check EXECUTION_PLAN.md checkboxes directly
```

Use AskUserQuestion to let the user choose.

## Error Handling

- If EXECUTION_PLAN.md exists but is empty → report and suggest `/generate-plan`
- If phase-state.json has parse errors → treat as Case A (no state) with a note about the corrupt file
- If a delegated skill fails → report the failure, don't retry automatically
