# Audit Skills

Analyze skills, legacy commands, and prompt templates in this repository against best practices and produce prioritized improvements.

## Workflow

Copy this checklist and track progress:

```
Audit Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Discover all auditable files (skills, commands, prompts)
- [ ] Step 2: Load criteria
- [ ] Step 3: Audit each file
- [ ] Step 4: Score and prioritize
- [ ] Step 5: Output report
```

### Step 1: Discover All Auditable Files

Find all skill-like files in the repository:

Use Glob to find files matching these patterns:
- `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` — Skills
- `.claude/commands/*.md` — Legacy commands
- `.claude/skills/*/PROMPT.md` — Co-located prompts
- `*_PROMPT.md` — Root-level prompt templates

Classify each file:

| Type | Example | Criteria Applied |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Skill** | `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | All criteria (L, C, S, E, D) |
| **Command** | `.claude/commands/*.md` | All criteria (L, C, S, E, D) — same frontmatter as skills |
| **Prompt** | `PROMPT.md`, `*_PROMPT.md` | L, C, S, E only — no frontmatter, so skip D1-D3 |

Record the total count across all types for verification later.

### Step 2: Load Criteria

Read [CRITERIA.md](CRITERIA.md) for the full audit checklist.

Read [SCORING.md](SCORING.md) for severity definitions.

### Step 3: Audit Each File

For each discovered file:

1. **Read the file** — note line count immediately
2. **Check applicable criteria** from CRITERIA.md (see type table in Step 1)
3. **For skills with co-located PROMPT.md** — audit the PROMPT.md too and report alongside the SKILL.md (they function as a unit)
4. **Record violations** with criterion ID and evidence

Use this template per file:

```
File: <path>
Type: Skill | Command | Prompt
Lines: <count> (+ <N> in PROMPT.md if applicable)
Violations:
- <ID>: <brief evidence>
```

### Step 4: Score and Prioritize

Group findings by severity (from SCORING.md):
- **Critical**: Likely to cause execution failures
- **Medium**: Degrades quality but may still work
- **Low**: Polish items

Within each severity, sort by:
1. Most violations in single skill (fix skill holistically)
2. Most common violation across skills (systemic issue)

### Step 5: Output Report

Use this format:

```markdown
# Skill Audit Report

Generated: <date>
Skills audited: <N>
Total findings: <N>

## Critical (fix first)

- **<skill-name>**: <violation summary> (<criterion-id>)
  - Evidence: <quote or line numbers>
  - Suggested fix: <concrete action>

## Medium Priority

...

## Low Priority

...

## Summary by Criterion

| ID | Description | Count |
|----|-------------|-------|
| C1 | Missing checklist | 5 |
| ... | ... | ... |
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| CRITERIA.md or SCORING.md not found | Report the missing file and stop — audit cannot proceed without criteria definitions. |
| No auditable files found (no skills, commands, or prompts) | Report that no files were discovered and stop. |
| Individual file unreadable | Log the file as "skipped (unreadable)" in the report and continue with remaining files. |

---

**REMINDER**: After completing the audit, verify your report includes all discovered files (skills, commands, and prompts). Missing files indicates incomplete analysis.
