# AGENTS.md (Toolkit Repo)

Workflow guidelines for AI agents making changes inside `ai_coding_project_base/`.

This repository is a **toolkit** (prompts, slash commands, skills). It is not a
“target app” that you execute phases against.

## Repo Context

- **Primary artifacts:** Markdown prompt templates and Claude Code skills.
- **Main directories:**
  - `.claude/skills/` — Skills (`SKILL.md`) — these create `/slash-commands`
  - `.claude/commands/` — Legacy command format (still works, but prefer skills)
  - `deprecated/` — Legacy/reference-only prompt files (avoid editing unless required)
  - `docs/` — Static documentation site assets

**Note:** Skills and commands are now merged in Claude Code. A file at `.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md`
creates `/review`. The `.claude/commands/` format still works but skills are preferred for new work.

## Operating Principles

- **Be conservative:** Prefer small, targeted edits over rewrites.
- **Keep behavior compatible:** Existing command names and core workflows should not
  break without a strong reason and explicit documentation.
- **Docs are code:** Treat prompt/command changes like API changes—update related
  docs when behavior or outputs change.
- **Avoid speculation:** If requirements are unclear, ask the user rather than
  encoding assumptions into prompts.

## Plan Review Protocol

After writing a plan in plan mode, use AskUserQuestion **before** calling
ExitPlanMode:

- "Ready to implement (Recommended)" → Call ExitPlanMode
- "Review with /codex-consult first" → Call ExitPlanMode (Skill/Bash tools
  are unavailable in plan mode, so you must exit first). After the user
  approves, **before doing any implementation work**, save the plan to a
  file if not already on disk, then run `/codex-consult <plan-file>`.
  Present the findings and use AskUserQuestion to confirm whether to
  proceed with implementation or revise the plan.
- "I want to modify the plan" → Stay in plan mode, ask what to change

Do NOT call ExitPlanMode without offering these options first.

## Editing Rules (Markdown / Prompts)

- Preserve existing structure, headings, and code fences unless intentionally changing
  behavior.
- When adding examples, keep them minimal and copy-pastable.
- Avoid introducing new long, duplicated sections—prefer referencing an existing
  command/skill or consolidating.

## Skills (`.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` and `.claude/commands/*.md`)

Skills and commands are merged in Claude Code. Both create `/slash-commands`:
- `.claude/skills/foo/SKILL.md` → `/foo`
- `.claude/commands/foo.md` → `/foo`

**Prefer skills format** for new work (supports supporting files, better discovery).

Guidelines:
- Keep the YAML frontmatter valid (`name`, `description`, `argument-hint`, `allowed-tools`).
- Use `toolkit-only: true` in frontmatter for skills that should NOT sync to target
  projects (e.g., `setup`, `update-target-projects`). All sync surfaces (setup,
  update-target-projects, sync, install-codex-skill-pack.sh) check this flag.
- Keep "Directory Guard" sections accurate; skills should fail fast when run in the
  wrong directory.
- Prefer general, reusable workflows (avoid product-specific rules).
- If a skill references additional assets, link them explicitly.
- If you add/rename a skill:
  - Update `docs/commands.md` (command reference) accordingly.
  - Ensure the skill aligns with constraints in `.claude/settings.json`.

## Global Skill Resolution

The toolkit now uses a global-only policy for skills. Projects should resolve
skills from `~/.claude/skills/` and should not keep long-lived project-local
copies in `.claude/skills/`.

Claude Code discovers skills from three tiers with project-local shadowing global:

1. **managed** (`/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/.claude/skills`)
2. **user** (`~/.claude/skills`) ← toolkit symlinks go here
3. **project** (`.claude/skills/`) ← shadows user/managed if present

**Resolution modes:**

| Mode | Description | When Used |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| `global` | All skills resolve via `~/.claude/skills/` | Required default for toolkit-managed projects |
| `local` | All skills copied to project `.claude/skills/` | Legacy state to migrate away from |
| `mixed` | Some global, some local | Legacy state to migrate away from |

**Behavior by project type:**

- **New projects:** `/setup` verifies global symlinks, then records global
  resolution without copying skills into the project.
- **Existing projects:** `/update-target-projects` should migrate legacy local
  or mixed projects to global resolution by default.
- **Shared repos:** Also use global resolution. Portability is handled by each
  collaborator bootstrapping `~/.claude/skills` from their own toolkit clone.

**Configuration (`toolkit-version.json`):**

```json
{
  "force_local_skills": false,
  "skill_resolution": "global"
}
```

- `force_local_skills`: legacy field; keep `false` for global-only behavior
- `skill_resolution`: expected value is `global` for toolkit-managed projects

**Migration:**

- **Adopt global:** `/update-target-projects` removes local copies, backs up
  modified skills, and switches to global resolution.
- **Legacy local projects:** treat as migration debt and convert during normal
  sync runs.

**Fallback:** If a global symlink is missing or broken, repair global symlinks.
Do not silently fall back to project-local copies.

## Cross-Model Verification

The toolkit supports cross-model verification using OpenAI Codex CLI:

- `/codex-review` — Review current branch code diffs. Supports
  `--upstream`, `--research`, `--base`, and `--model` flags.
- `/codex-consult` — Get a second opinion on documents, specs, or plans (non-code content).
  Supports `--upstream`, `--research`, and `--model` flags.
- `/create-pr` — Create GitHub PR with automatic Codex review. Auto-detects code vs
  doc changes and routes to `/codex-review` or `/codex-consult`. Blocks on critical issues
  unless `--skip-review` is used.
- `/phase-checkpoint` — Automatically invokes `/codex-review` when Codex is available

When Codex CLI is installed and authenticated, phase checkpoints include a second-opinion
review. Generation commands (`/product-spec`, `/technical-spec`, `/feature-spec`, etc.)
use `/codex-consult` for document review. All generation and feature commands run from the
target project directory. Only `/setup` and `/update-target-projects` run from the toolkit.
Codex researches current documentation before reviewing, catching issues where training
data may differ between models.

**Configuration** (`.claude/settings.local.json`):
```json
{
  "codexReview": {
    "enabled": true,
    "codeModel": "gpt-5.3-codex"
  },
  "codexConsult": {
    "enabled": true,
    "researchModel": "gpt-5.2"
  }
}
```

Codex findings are advisory and don't block workflows.

**Safety guard:** `/codex-review` and `/codex-consult` stash uncommitted changes and
record HEAD before invocation. Any commits Codex makes are reverted afterward and the
stash is restored, preventing accidental working tree modifications.

## Workstream Contract (`.workstream/`)

The toolkit includes orchestrator-agnostic scripts for initializing, running, and
verifying git worktrees. These scripts enable parallel fire-and-forget workstreams
with any AI agent (Codex App, Claude Code, Conductor) or manual usage.

**Scripts:**

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `.workstream/setup.sh` | Initialize a worktree (install deps, copy env files, symlink settings) |
| `.workstream/dev.sh [PORT]` | Start dev server with auto-allocated port |
| `.workstream/verify.sh` | Run quality gate (typecheck → lint → test → build) |
| `.workstream/lib.sh` | Shared utility library (sourced by other scripts) |

**Configuration:** Each project may create a `workstream.json` at the repo root (not
synced from toolkit — project-specific). See `.workstream/workstream.json.example`
for the schema and `.workstream/README.md` for full documentation.

**Syncing:** Workstream scripts are synced to target projects alongside skills via
`/setup` and `/update-target-projects`. The scripts themselves are toolkit-owned
(always updated on sync); `workstream.json` is project-owned (never overwritten).

**Codex App integration:** The `.codex/setup.sh` wrapper delegates to
`.workstream/setup.sh`. Configure it in Codex App Settings (Cmd+,) →
Local Environments → Setup script.

## Validation

- Run `npm run lint` before finishing changes that touch Markdown files.
- Do not add new tooling/formatters unless requested.

## Git Hygiene (If Asked to Use Git)

- Do not rewrite history (`reset --hard`, force push) unless explicitly requested.
- Avoid broad formatting churn; keep diffs reviewable.

## Post-Commit Sync Prompt

When you see `TOOLKIT SYNC PENDING` in git commit output, it means skills were
modified and target projects may need syncing. You MUST:

1. Use `AskUserQuestion` to prompt:
   - Question: "Skills were modified. Sync target projects now?"
   - Options: "Yes, sync now" / "No, skip for now"

2. If user says yes, run `/update-target-projects`

3. After sync (or skip), delete the marker file:
   ```bash
   rm -f .claude/sync-pending.json
   ```

This replaces the previous background sync approach which couldn't access other
project directories due to sandboxing.

## Post-Commit Documentation Update

When you see `DOCUMENTATION SYNC PENDING` or detect `.claude/doc-update-pending.json`:

1. Run `/update-docs` to analyze the commit and update documentation
2. The skill will:
   - Analyze what changed in the commit
   - Update README, AGENTS.md, CHANGELOG, and docs/ as appropriate
   - Create a follow-up `docs:` commit if changes are made
3. After completion, delete the marker file:
   ```bash
   rm -f .claude/doc-update-pending.json
   ```

**Note:** This applies to all projects with the doc-update hook installed, not
just the toolkit.
