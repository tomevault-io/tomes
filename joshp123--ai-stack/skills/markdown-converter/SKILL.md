# Markdown Converter

Convert files to useful Markdown using the installed `markitdown` and `markit` CLIs.

## Route First

- Use `markitdown` first for `.docx`, `.pptx`, `.xlsx`, `.xls`, HTML, CSV, JSON, XML, images, audio, ZIP, YouTube, EPUB, and most non-PDF formats.
- Use `markitdown` first for email-like, letter-like, or mostly linear-prose PDFs.
- Use `markit -q` first for table-heavy, form-like, or multi-column PDFs where layout matters.
- Use `markitdown --use-plugins` for scanned or image-heavy PDFs only when the environment already has a working OpenAI-compatible vision client/model configured for MarkItDown OCR.
- Fall back to plain `markitdown` and say OCR is unavailable when that OCR configuration is missing.

## Retry Or Compare

- Do not run both tools by default.
- Run the other tool when the first output is high-value and suspect, or when the user explicitly asks to compare.
- Treat these as suspect: flattened tables, broken reading order, repeated headers or footers, near-empty output, clearly jumbled text, or giant `data:image` blocks.
- For DOCX, prefer `markitdown` when `markit` emits base64-heavy Markdown.

## Commands

```bash
# Default DOCX / non-PDF path
markitdown input.docx > output.md

# Default prose-PDF path
markitdown input.pdf > output.md

# Layout-sensitive PDF path
markit -q input.pdf > output.md

# OCR path, only when OCR is configured
markitdown --use-plugins input.pdf > output.md

# Compare both on a PDF, then keep the better result
markitdown input.pdf > /tmp/markitdown.md
markit -q input.pdf > /tmp/markit.md
```

## Output Rule

- Return the chosen Markdown, not two full outputs.
- If both tools were run, state which tool won and why in one short sentence.
