# Adeu: Professional Redlining & Review

## Overview
Adeu acts as a "Virtual DOM" for DOCX files. It allows you to read documents as Markdown, propose edits, and apply them as native XML `w:ins` (insertions) and `w:del` (deletions) without breaking document structure.

## Capabilities
1.  **Extract**: Read text with high fidelity (preserving comments and structural headers).
2.  **Diff**: Compare two DOCX files to see what changed.
3.  **Edit**: Apply search-and-replace modifications that result in Track Changes.
4.  **Review**: Accept/Reject existing changes or Reply to comments.

## Execution Model
This skill relies on the `adeu` CLI tool. Always execute via `uvx` to ensure the environment is correct.

```bash
uvx adeu --version
