# Keboola CLI Plugin

Manage and review Keboola projects using the CLI and a 10-agent review team.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/kbc-init` | Initialize a new Keboola project locally |
| `/kbc-pull` | Pull configurations from remote project |
| `/kbc-push` | Push local changes to remote project |
| `/kbc-diff` | Show differences between local and remote |
| `/kbc-review` | Launch the full 10-agent project review team |

## Review Team

`/kbc-review` spawns 10 agents in parallel to audit every dimension of a Keboola project:

1. **SQL Reviewer** -- Anti-patterns, correctness, Snowflake-specific issues
2. **Config Reviewer** -- Naming, descriptions, mappings, best practices
3. **DWH Architect** -- Data model, layering, dimensional modeling, naming
4. **Data Quality Analyst** -- NULLs, duplicates, freshness, referential integrity (live MCP queries)
5. **Financial Analyst** -- P&L, Balance Sheet, KPIs, COA mapping, multi-ERP awareness
6. **Semantic Layer Reviewer** -- Metric definitions, completeness, auto-generation readiness
7. **Security Auditor** -- Credentials, PII, access control, GDPR/CCPA compliance
8. **Performance Optimizer** -- Job durations, SQL efficiency, incremental loading, parallelization
9. **Template Readiness Assessor** -- Parameterization, mapping tables, generation blockers
10. **Consolidator** -- Data flow mapping + merged report from all 9 reviewers

Output: Individual reports in `docs/review_*.md` plus a consolidated `docs/PROJECT_REVIEW_REPORT.md`.
