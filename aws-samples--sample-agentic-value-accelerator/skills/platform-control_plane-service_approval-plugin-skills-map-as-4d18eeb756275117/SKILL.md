# Service Approval — Map: Assemble

Deterministic assembly of the 3 map sub-skill outputs into the final mapping state files.
This step builds traceability links, identifies coverage gaps, and produces the markdown
reports. It is largely mechanical — no LLM reasoning about control-objective alignment.

**Inputs:**
- `.service-approval/<slug>/04-map/map-framework-parsed.json` — framework objectives
- `.service-approval/<slug>/04-map/map-controls-generated.json` — controls with metadata
- `.service-approval/<slug>/04-map/map-framework-mapped.json` — framework mappings with quality gates
- `.service-approval/<slug>/03-validate/validated.json` — mitigations and capabilities (for traceability)

**Outputs:**
- `.service-approval/<slug>/04-map/mapping-results.json` — machine-readable mapping state (final)
- `.service-approval/<slug>/04-map/controls-catalog.md` — controls inventory by Category x Scope
- `.service-approval/<slug>/04-map/framework-mapping.md` — framework objective crosswalk

---

## Prerequisites

**Hard gate — halts the run if upstream phases are incomplete.** The
pre-phase precondition CLI verifies that each upstream phase produced
its declared artifacts (with min-size thresholds to catch stub writes).
Exit non-zero from any of these means STOP — do not proceed with assembly.

```bash
python3 -m tools.validate.check_phase_complete --slug <slug> --phase 03-validate || exit 2
# Note: 04-map outputs from upstream sub-skills are checked individually below
# (map-assemble produces controls-catalog.md / framework-mapping.md / mapping-results.json
# which are the outputs OF this skill, so they're validated in Phase 7).
test -f .service-approval/<slug>/04-map/map-framework-parsed.json || { echo "ERROR: map-parse-framework didn't run"; exit 2; }
test -f .service-approval/<slug>/04-map/map-controls-generated.json || { echo "ERROR: map-generate-controls didn't run"; exit 2; }
test -f .service-approval/<slug>/04-map/map-framework-mapped.json || { echo "ERROR: map-framework-mapping didn't run"; exit 2; }
```

After Phase 7 below writes mapping-results.json, controls-catalog.md, and
framework-mapping.md, the Stop hook's P7 check (validate_pipeline_integrity:
check_phase_outputs) re-validates that all 04-map outputs are present and
non-stub-sized. Skipping Phase 5 or Phase 6 of this skill will trip P7
and fail the verdict.

**Audit log — emit start/end events:**

```bash
python3 -m tools.validate.log --slug <slug> --phase 04-map \
    --source skill:map-assemble --verdict start \
    --message "assembling map outputs"
# ... do the work ...
python3 -m tools.validate.log --slug <slug> --phase 04-map \
    --source skill:map-assemble --verdict end \
    --message "wrote mapping-results.json + controls-catalog.md + framework-mapping.md"
```

If the skill halts early (precondition failure, validation error), emit
`--verdict halt` instead of `end` with the reason in `--message`.

---

## Phase 1: Build Reverse Index (controls -> framework objectives)

For each control, collect all framework objectives it maps to:

```python
import json

fw_mapped = json.load(open('.service-approval/<slug>/04-map/map-framework-mapped.json'))
cg = json.load(open('.service-approval/<slug>/04-map/map-controls-generated.json'))

# Build reverse index: control_id -> [objective_ids]
ctrl_to_objs = {}
for f in fw_mapped['framework_mapping']:
    if f.get('status') != 'MAPPED':
        continue
    for c in f.get('controls', []):
        ctrl_to_objs.setdefault(c['control_id'], []).append(f['objective_id'])

# Enrich controls with framework_objectives. Posture + source fields (from Rule C1
# in map-generate-controls) flow through unchanged — they're already on each control
# and will be propagated verbatim into mapping-results.json.controls[]. Every downstream
# generate sub-skill reads ctrl['posture'] to populate _metadata.posture in the
# generated artifact, which CHECK-15 enforces at hook time.
for ctrl in cg['controls']:
    ctrl['framework_objectives'] = sorted(set(ctrl_to_objs.get(ctrl['id'], [])))
    # posture + source: carry forward if present; absence is tolerated for legacy state
    # files generated before Phase C (CHECK-15 only fires when _metadata.posture exists).
```

---

## Phase 2: Build Threat-Mitigation-Control Map

**Canonical implementation:** `scripts/map-assemble.py` →
`build_threat_mitigation_map(mitigations, controls)`. Call the script
rather than reimplementing the logic inline — prior inline pseudocode in
this SKILL drifted from the script (emitted `controls` instead of
`control_ids`, omitted the `layers` sub-object) and caused a downstream
schema mismatch in the `/test` skill's coverage step.

### Emitted shape (one entry per mitigation)

```json
{
  "mitigation_id": "<M-*>",
  "statement": "<mitigation statement from validated.json>",
  "resource_type": "<service-specific resource/asset name>",
  "coverage": "FULL | PARTIAL | NONE",
  "control_ids": ["<CTRL-*>", "..."],
  "framework_objectives": ["<framework-objective-id>", "..."],
  "layers": {
    "preventive": ["<CTRL-*-PRV-*>"],
    "proactive":  ["<CTRL-*-PRO-*>"],
    "detective":  ["<CTRL-*-DET-*>"],
    "responsive": ["<CTRL-*-COR-*>"]
  },
  "residual_gaps": ["<gap-description>", "..."]
}
```

### Coverage rule

See `build_threat_mitigation_map` in `scripts/map-assemble.py` for the
exact implementation. Summary:

- `FULL` — mitigation has both a preventive/proactive AND a detective
  control.
- `PARTIAL` — mitigation has some controls, but not both layers.
- `NONE` — no controls reference this mitigation (`mitigation_ids[]`
  lookup is empty).

### Residual gaps

Emitted for every missing layer (preventive, detective, responsive). The
exact strings live in the script — do NOT hand-author them in downstream
skills; read them from the emitted `residual_gaps` array.

### Consumers

Consumers of `threat_mitigation_map[]` entries:
- `skills/test/SKILL.md` — mitigation coverage calculation reads
  `entry.control_ids` (NOT `entry.controls`).
- `skills/summarize/SKILL.md` — APPROVAL-REPORT coverage matrix reads
  `entry.coverage`, `entry.layers`, and `entry.residual_gaps`.
- Framework mapping UI — reads `entry.framework_objectives`.

When changing the schema, update `scripts/map-assemble.py` first, then
this shape spec, then consumers — in that order.

---

## Phase 2b: Build ATT&CK Coverage Summary (optional)

Run only if `validated.json` contains `attack_surface`. If absent, skip — backward compatible.

```python
attack_surface = vj.get('attack_surface')
attack_coverage = None

if attack_surface:
    techniques = attack_surface.get('applicable_techniques', [])
    technique_ids = {t['technique_id'] for t in techniques}

    # Build technique -> controls mapping
    tech_to_ctrls = {}
    for ctrl in controls:
        for tid in ctrl.get('attack_techniques', []):
            tech_to_ctrls.setdefault(tid, []).append(ctrl['id'])

    # Calculate coverage
    covered_techniques = [t for t in techniques if t['technique_id'] in tech_to_ctrls]
    uncovered_techniques = [t for t in techniques if t['technique_id'] not in tech_to_ctrls]

    # Build tactic-level summary
    tactic_coverage = {}
    for t in techniques:
        tid = t['tactic_id']
        if tid not in tactic_coverage:
            tactic_coverage[tid] = {
                'name': t['tactic_name'],
                'total': 0, 'covered': 0, 'uncovered': 0,
                'techniques_covered': [], 'techniques_uncovered': []
            }
        tactic_coverage[tid]['total'] += 1
        if t['technique_id'] in tech_to_ctrls:
            tactic_coverage[tid]['covered'] += 1
            tactic_coverage[tid]['techniques_covered'].append(t['technique_id'])
        else:
            tactic_coverage[tid]['uncovered'] += 1
            tactic_coverage[tid]['techniques_uncovered'].append(t['technique_id'])

    attack_coverage = {
        'total_techniques': len(techniques),
        'covered_by_controls': len(covered_techniques),
        'uncovered': len(uncovered_techniques),
        'uncovered_techniques': [
            {'technique_id': t['technique_id'], 'technique_name': t['technique_name'],
             'applicability': t['applicability']}
            for t in uncovered_techniques
        ],
        'tactic_coverage': tactic_coverage,
        'technique_to_controls': {tid: cids for tid, cids in tech_to_ctrls.items()}
    }
```

---

## Phase 3: Identify Coverage Gaps

Detect and classify ALL gap types:

```python
coverage_gaps = []

# 0. posture_gap: forward any (mitigation, posture) gaps produced by Rule C1's
# feasibility filter in map-generate-controls. These are structural gaps — a mitigation
# was intended to produce a preventative-request or reactive-corrective control but the
# parameter's gateable_by / mutability precluded it.
for g in cg.get('coverage_gaps', []):
    coverage_gaps.append({
        "type": "posture_gap",
        "id": g.get('mitigation_id'),
        "description": (
            f"Posture {g.get('posture')!r} not feasible for mitigation "
            f"{g.get('mitigation_id')}: {g.get('reason')}"
        ),
        "recommendation": (
            "Either accept the posture gap (documented), or pick a compensating "
            "mechanism at a different posture (e.g., reactive-detective)."
        ),
        "posture": g.get('posture'),
        "reason": g.get('reason'),
    })

# 1. mitigation_gap: mitigations with NONE coverage
for t in threat_mitigation_map:
    if t['coverage'] == 'NONE':

            "recommendation": f"Generate controls for: {t['mitigation_goal'][:100]}"
        })

# 2. single_layer: mitigations with only one control category
for t in threat_mitigation_map:
    if t['coverage'] == 'NONE':
        continue
    ctrl_cats = set()
    for ctrl in controls:
        if ctrl['id'] in t['controls']:
            ctrl_cats.add(ctrl['category'])
    preventive_cats = ctrl_cats & {'PRV', 'PRO'}
    detective_cats = ctrl_cats & {'DET', 'COR'}

        })
    elif detective_cats and not preventive_cats:
        coverage_gaps.append({
            "type": "single_layer",
            "id": t['mitigation_id'],
            "description": f"Mitigation {t['mitigation_id']} has only detective controls, no preventive",
            "recommendation": "Add preventive control (SCP, IAM policy, or resource policy)"
        })

# 3. partial_parameter_coverage: mitigations where some params uncovered
for t in threat_mitigation_map:
    if t['residual_gaps']:
        for gap in t['residual_gaps']:
            if 'Parameters not controlled' in gap:
                coverage_gaps.append({
                    "type": "partial_parameter_coverage",
                    "id": t['mitigation_id'],
                    "description": gap,
                    "recommendation": "Add controls for uncovered parameters"
                })

# 4. framework_gap: MAPPED objectives with only SUPPORTS coverage
for f in fw_mapped['framework_mapping']:
    if f.get('status') == 'MAPPED' and f.get('coverage') == 'SUPPORTS':
        coverage_gaps.append({
            "type": "framework_gap",

            "description": f"Objective {f['objective_id']} has only Low confidence controls",
            "recommendation": "Implement stronger controls directly addressing this objective"
        })

# 5. control_orphan: controls not mapped to any objective
orphaned = fw_mapped.get('quality_gate_results', {}).get('orphaned_controls', [])
for oid in orphaned:
    coverage_gaps.append({
        "type": "control_orphan",

                "recommendation": "Generate controls targeting this attack technique"
            })
```

---

## Phase 4: Assemble mapping-results.json

Combine all data into the final `mapping-results.json`:

```python
fw_parsed = json.load(open('.service-approval/<slug>/04-map/map-framework-parsed.json'))

# Build control_summary
from collections import Counter
scope_counts = Counter(c['scope'] for c in controls)
cat_counts = Counter(c['category'] for c in controls)
mech_counts = Counter(c['mechanism'] for c in controls)

mapping_results = {
    "schema_version": "1.0",
    "service": cg.get('service', vj.get('service', '')),
    "framework": fw_parsed['framework'],
    "controls": controls,  # enriched with framework_objectives
    "threat_mitigation_map": threat_mitigation_map,
    "framework_mapping": fw_mapped['framework_mapping'],
    "framework_coverage_summary": fw_mapped['framework_coverage_summary'],
    "coverage_gaps": coverage_gaps,
    "control_summary": {
        "total_controls": len(controls),
        "by_scope": dict(scope_counts),
        "by_category": dict(cat_counts),
        "by_mechanism": dict(mech_counts)
    }
}

# Add ATT&CK coverage if available (optional — backward compatible)
if attack_coverage:
    mapping_results['attack_coverage'] = attack_coverage

with open('.service-approval/<slug>/04-map/mapping-results.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(mapping_results, f, indent=2)
```

---

## Phase 5: Write controls-catalog.md

Write `.service-approval/<slug>/04-map/controls-catalog.md`:

```markdown
# Security Controls Catalog — {service-name}

**Service:** {service-name}
**Date Generated:** {date}
**Total Controls:** {count}
**Resources:** {resource-list}
**Mitigations Addressed:** {count}

## Control Categories

| Category | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Preventive** | Designed to prevent an event from occurring |
| **Proactive** | Designed to prevent the creation of noncompliant resources |
| **Detective** | Designed to detect, log, and alert after an event has occurred |
| **Responsive** | Designed to drive remediation of adverse events or deviations from your security baseline |

## Control Matrix Summary

|  | Proactive | Preventive | Detective | Responsive | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Organisation** | N | N | N | N | N |
| **Account** | N | N | N | N | N |
| **Resource** | N | N | N | N | N |
| **Total** | N | N | N | N | N |

## Organisation-Level Controls

### Proactive

#### {CTRL-ORG-PRO-001} — {Control Title}

- **Resource:** {resource-type}
- **Scope:** Organisation
- **Description:** {what this control does}
- **Enforcement Point:** {mechanism}
- **Implementation:** {how to implement}
- **Parameters Controlled:** {API parameters}
- **Mitigations:** {M-xxx IDs}
- **AWS Doc Reference:** {URL}

[repeat for each control, organized by Scope > Category]

### Preventive
### Detective
### Responsive

## Account-Level Controls

### Proactive
### Preventive
### Detective
### Responsive

## Resource-Level Controls

### Proactive
### Preventive
### Detective
### Responsive
```

Each control entry MUST include a `Mitigations:` line referencing the mitigation IDs it addresses.

**Responsive Controls** MUST be generated for every mitigation that has detective controls.
The responsive control completes the detect-respond loop. Typical responsive mechanisms:
- **Lambda + EventBridge** — auto-tag, notify, or remediate on detection
- **SSM Automation runbook** — manual or scheduled remediation workflow
- **Step Functions workflow** — multi-step orchestration (detect → notify → remediate → verify)
- **Systems Manager OpsItems** — create operational items for manual follow-up

If `attack_coverage` is available, add after the Control Matrix Summary:

```markdown
## ATT&CK Technique Coverage

| Tactic | Tactic Name | Techniques | Covered | Uncovered |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TA0001 | Initial Access | 3 | 2 | 1 |
[repeat for each tactic]

### Uncovered HIGH Techniques

| Technique | Name | Applicability | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| T1190 | Exploit Public-Facing Application | HIGH | Add VPC endpoint controls |
```

---

## Phase 6: Write framework-mapping.md

Write `.service-approval/<slug>/04-map/framework-mapping.md`.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** The framework-mapping.md MUST be organized so that EVERY individual
control objective from the parsed framework has its own entry showing which service controls
satisfy it. This is the primary deliverable for compliance reviewers — they need to look up
any framework objective and immediately see which controls address it.

Do NOT group controls by domain and then list objectives as a flat bullet list. Do NOT
produce a document organized by service control categories. The document MUST be organized
by framework objective.

The document MUST be service-agnostic and framework-agnostic in its structure — it works for
any AWS service and any compliance framework provided as input.
Use the framework name, domain names, and objective IDs from `map-framework-parsed.json`.
Use the service name from `map-controls-generated.json`. Never hardcode a specific framework
or service name in the template logic.

### Naming Requirements (CRITICAL)

1. **Objective names are REQUIRED.** Every framework objective MUST include its full title
   from `map-framework-parsed.json`, not just the ID. Format: `{Objective-ID}: {Full Title}`.
   A table row or section header with only an ID (e.g., "AIS-01") is incomplete — always
   write `AIS-01: Application and Interface Security Policy`.

2. **Control names are REQUIRED.** Every control reference MUST include its full name from
   `map-controls-generated.json`, not just the ID. Format: `{CTRL-ID} — {Control Name}`.
   A table cell with only "CTRL-005" is incomplete — always write
   `CTRL-005 — Enforce IAM authorizer for Gateways`.

3. **Status values — use "Not Applicable" not "Not Mapped".** When a framework objective
   cannot be addressed by AWS service-level technical controls (e.g., organizational
   processes, HR policies, physical security, change management), the status MUST be
   `Not Applicable` with a reason explaining WHY it's not applicable to service-level
   controls. The value "Not Mapped" is BANNED — it implies the mapping was incomplete
   rather than intentionally excluded. Valid statuses:
   - `MAPPED` — one or more service controls address this objective
   - `Not Applicable` — this objective is about non-technical controls (organizational,
     physical, HR, process) that cannot be enforced at the AWS service level

```markdown
# {Framework Name} Control Mapping — {service-name}

**Framework:** {name} v{version}
**Source:** {source_file}
**Date Generated:** {date}
**Total Service Controls:** {count}
**Framework Objectives Total:** {total}
**Objectives Mapped:** {mapped}
**Objectives Not Applicable:** {na}
**Domains Covered:** {domains_covered} / {total_domains}
```

Where `{Framework Name}` and `{name}` come from `map-framework-parsed.json.framework.name`.
Examples of rendered titles:
- "CSA CCMv4 Control Mapping — Amazon S3" (default, no framework file provided)
- "NIST 800-53 Control Mapping — Amazon ECS" (customer uploaded NIST file)
- "Custom Framework Control Mapping — AWS KMS" (customer uploaded unrecognized framework)

```markdown
## Domain Coverage Summary

| Domain | Objectives in Domain | Mapped | Not Applicable | Coverage % | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| {domain} | N | N | N | N% | {note} |

---

## Objective-to-Controls Mapping

For EVERY framework objective, list the service controls that satisfy it. This section is
the core of the document. Each objective gets its own subsection regardless of whether it
has mapped controls or is Not Applicable.

### {Domain Name}

#### {Objective-ID}: {Objective Full Title}

**Status:** {MAPPED | Not Applicable}
**Coverage:** {FULL | PARTIAL | SUPPORTS | N/A}
**Reason:** {1-sentence summary of why this coverage level was assigned, or why Not Applicable}

| Control ID | Control Name | Category | Confidence | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| {CTRL-ID} | {Full control name} | {Preventive/Proactive/Detective/Responsive} | {High/Medium/Low} | {1-sentence specific rationale connecting this control's mechanism to this objective's requirement} |

If status is Not Applicable, the table is omitted and only the Reason line appears. Example:
> **Status:** Not Applicable
> **Reason:** This objective addresses organizational change management processes which cannot be enforced at the AWS service level.

[Repeat for EVERY objective in the domain, then repeat for EVERY domain]

---

## Not Applicable Objectives

Framework objectives that are not addressable via AWS service-level technical controls.
Each entry MUST explain WHY it is not applicable.

| Objective ID | Objective Title | Domain | Reason Not Applicable |
|---|---|---|---|
| {obj-id} | {Full objective title} | {domain} | {why this is a non-technical/organizational control} |

---

## Unmapped Service Controls

Controls that were generated but do not map to any framework objective.

| Control ID | Control Name | Category | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| {CTRL-ID} | {Full control name} | {category} | {reason why no framework objective applies} |

---

## Coverage Gaps

Framework objectives where coverage is PARTIAL, SUPPORTS, or where no HIGH-confidence
controls exist.

| Objective ID | Objective Title | Domain | Gap Description | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| {obj-id} | {Full title} | {domain} | {what is missing} | {what to implement} |

---

## Threat-to-Framework Traceability

Shows the full chain: Threat Mitigation → Service Controls → Framework Objectives.

| Mitigation ID | Threat Description | Service Controls | Framework Objectives | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| {MIT-ID} | {threat summary} | {CTRL-ID — Name, ...} | {OBJ-ID: Title, ...} | {FULL/PARTIAL/NONE} |
```

**Assembly rules for this phase:**

1. Iterate over `map-framework-mapped.json` `framework_mapping[]` array. Each entry has
   `objective_id`, `domain`, `title`, `status`, `coverage`, `reason`, and `controls[]`.

2. Group objectives by domain. Within each domain, sort by objective_id.

3. For each objective, write the subsection header INCLUDING the full title from
   `map-framework-parsed.json`. The header format is `#### {ID}: {Title}`.

4. For each control in the objective's controls table, look up the control's `name` and
   `category` from `map-controls-generated.json`. Write the full name, not just the ID.

5. For objectives with `status: "NOT_MAPPED"` or `status: "N/A"`, write status as
   "Not Applicable" and include the reason from `map-framework-mapped.json`.

6. For the Not Applicable Objectives section, collect all objectives where status is NOT
   "MAPPED" and list them with their full titles and reasons.

7. For the Unmapped Service Controls section, use `quality_gate_results.orphaned_controls`
   from `map-framework-mapped.json`.

8. For Coverage Gaps, use `coverage_gaps` assembled in Phase 3 of this skill, filtered to
   `framework_gap` type entries.

9. For Threat-to-Framework Traceability, use `threat_mitigation_map` assembled in Phase 2
   of this skill. Include full control names and objective titles.
