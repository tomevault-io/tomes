# Security Hardening

Proactive security improvement suggestions. Unlike vulnerability scanners
that find what is broken, this skill identifies what could be better --
defense-in-depth measures, missing security headers, insufficient input
validation, absent rate limiting, and other hardening opportunities that
reduce the blast radius of future vulnerabilities.

## Supported Flags

Read `../../shared/schemas/flags.md` for the full flag specification.

| Flag | Hardening Behavior |
|------|-------------------|
| `--scope` | Default `changed`. Use `full` for comprehensive hardening review. |
| `--depth quick` | Check for missing security headers and obvious hardening gaps only. |
| `--depth standard` | Full hardening review: headers, validation, logging, error handling, configuration. |
| `--depth deep` | Standard + analyze middleware chains, review all trust boundaries, check defense layering. |
| `--depth expert` | Deep + compare against security benchmarks (CIS, OWASP ASVS), generate hardening scorecard. |
| `--severity` | Filter suggestions by impact level. |
| `--format` | Default `text`. Use `md` for a hardening checklist document. |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Technology Stack

Scan the codebase to determine:

1. **Web framework(s)**: Express, Django, Flask, Spring, Rails, Next.js, ASP.NET, FastAPI, etc.
2. **Deployment target**: Container, serverless, VM, PaaS (from Dockerfile, serverless.yml, etc.).
3. **Reverse proxy/CDN**: Nginx, Apache, Cloudflare, AWS ALB (from config files).
4. **Database(s)**: SQL, NoSQL, cache layers.
5. **Authentication mechanism**: Session, JWT, OAuth, SAML.
6. **Existing security middleware**: Helmet, django-security, Spring Security, etc.

### Step 2: Check Security Headers

Verify the application sets these HTTP response headers (or that a reverse proxy / CDN handles them):

| Header | Recommended Value | Impact |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| `Content-Security-Policy` | Strict policy, no `unsafe-inline` / `unsafe-eval` | Mitigates XSS |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload` | Enforces HTTPS |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` | Prevents MIME sniffing |
| `X-Frame-Options` | `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN` | Prevents clickjacking |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` or stricter | Limits referrer leakage |
| `Permissions-Policy` | Disable unused browser features | Reduces attack surface |
| `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` | `same-origin` | Prevents cross-origin attacks |
| `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` | `same-origin` | Controls resource sharing |
| `Cache-Control` | `no-store` for sensitive responses | Prevents cache leaks |

Note: If a reverse proxy config (nginx.conf, etc.) is present and sets these headers, do not flag them as missing from application code.

### Step 3: Review CORS Configuration

Check for overly permissive CORS settings:

1. `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on authenticated endpoints.
2. Reflecting the `Origin` header without validation.
3. `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` with wildcard origins.
4. Overly broad allowed methods or headers.
5. Missing `Vary: Origin` when origin is dynamic.

### Step 4: Assess Input Validation

For each entry point discovered (or in scope):

1. **Schema validation**: Are request bodies validated against a schema (Joi, Zod, Pydantic, JSON Schema)?
2. **Type coercion**: Are string inputs properly typed before use?
3. **Length limits**: Are string lengths bounded? Are array sizes limited?
4. **Allowlist vs denylist**: Is validation positive (allowlist) rather than negative (denylist)?
5. **Nested input**: Are deeply nested objects limited to prevent DoS?
6. **File validation**: Are uploaded files validated beyond extension (magic bytes, size limits)?

### Step 5: Check Rate Limiting

Identify endpoints that should have rate limiting:

1. **Authentication endpoints**: Login, registration, password reset, MFA verification.
2. **API endpoints**: Especially those that are computationally expensive or return sensitive data.
3. **File upload endpoints**: To prevent storage exhaustion.
4. **Search/query endpoints**: To prevent enumeration and DoS.

Check if rate limiting is implemented and whether limits are reasonable.

### Step 6: Review Error Handling and Information Disclosure

1. **Stack traces**: Are stack traces exposed in production error responses?
2. **Verbose errors**: Do error messages reveal internal paths, versions, or database details?
3. **Error differentiation**: Do auth errors distinguish between "user not found" and "wrong password" (enables enumeration)?
4. **Default error pages**: Are framework default error pages replaced?
5. **Debug mode**: Is debug mode disabled in production configuration?

### Step 7: Assess Security Logging

Check that these security-relevant events are logged:

1. **Authentication events**: Login success/failure, logout, password changes.
2. **Authorization failures**: Access denied events with user and resource context.
3. **Input validation failures**: Rejected requests with sanitized details.
4. **Administrative actions**: Config changes, user management, privilege changes.
5. **Sensitive data access**: Audit trail for PII/financial data reads.

Verify logs do NOT contain: passwords, tokens, credit card numbers, SSNs, or other sensitive data.

### Step 8: Check Defensive Coding Patterns

1. **Fail-closed defaults**: Do authorization checks default to deny?
2. **Secure defaults**: Are new configurations secure by default?
3. **Least privilege**: Do database connections, API keys, and service accounts use minimal permissions?
4. **Timeout configuration**: Do HTTP clients, database connections, and external calls have timeouts?
5. **Resource limits**: Are memory/CPU-intensive operations bounded?
6. **Dependency security**: Is `npm audit` / `pip audit` / equivalent run in CI?

### Step 9: Report

Output hardening suggestions grouped by category.

## Output Format

Hardening suggestions are advisory and use a lighter format than vulnerability findings.

```
## Security Hardening Report

### Summary
- Hardening suggestions: N
- By priority: N HIGH, N MEDIUM, N LOW
- Categories covered: headers, cors, validation, rate-limiting, logging, error-handling, config

### HIGH Priority

#### [H-001] Missing Content-Security-Policy header
**Category**: Headers | **Effort**: Low
**Location**: src/middleware/security.ts
**Current**: No CSP header set
**Recommended**: Add strict CSP via helmet
```js
app.use(helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
  directives: {
    defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
    scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
    styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
    imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:"],
  }
}));
```

### MEDIUM Priority
...

### LOW Priority
...
```

When hardening gaps represent actual vulnerabilities (e.g., CORS misconfiguration allowing credential theft), emit a formal finding using `../../shared/schemas/findings.md`.

Finding ID prefix: **HARD** (e.g., `HARD-001`).

- `metadata.tool`: `"harden"`
- `references.cwe`: Varies by suggestion (e.g., `CWE-693` Protection Mechanism Failure, `CWE-16` Configuration)

## Pragmatism Notes

- Hardening is contextual. An internal admin tool has different requirements than a public API.
- Do not recommend CSP for a CLI tool or rate limiting for a batch job.
- If a CDN or reverse proxy handles headers, note that rather than flagging missing headers in app code.
- Prioritize suggestions that are easy to implement with high security impact.
- Acknowledge when existing security measures are already good. Not every review needs findings.
- Some frameworks (Next.js, Rails) include secure defaults. Credit what is already done well.
