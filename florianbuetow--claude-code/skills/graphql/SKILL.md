# GraphQL Security (GQL)

Analyze GraphQL APIs for security vulnerabilities including introspection
enabled in production, missing query depth limits, no complexity analysis,
batching abuse, alias-based denial of service, and missing per-field
authorization. GraphQL's flexibility makes it a rich attack surface when
default configurations are deployed to production without hardening.

## Supported Flags

Read `../../shared/schemas/flags.md` for the full flag specification. This skill
supports all cross-cutting flags. Key flags for this skill:

- `--scope` determines which files to analyze (default: `changed`)
- `--depth standard` reads code and checks GraphQL configuration
- `--depth deep` traces resolvers to data sources and maps authorization coverage
- `--severity` filters output (GraphQL issues range from `medium` to `critical`)

## Framework Context

Key CWEs in scope:
- CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information (introspection)
- CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (depth/complexity)
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization (per-field auth)
- CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits (batching)
- CWE-284: Improper Access Control

## Detection Patterns

Read `references/detection-patterns.md` for the full catalog of code patterns,
search heuristics, language-specific examples, and false positive guidance.

## Workflow

### 1. Determine Scope

Parse flags and resolve the file list per `../../shared/schemas/flags.md`.
Filter to files likely to contain GraphQL logic:

- Schema definitions (`**/*.graphql`, `**/schema.*`, `**/typeDefs*`)
- Resolver implementations (`**/resolvers/**`, `**/graphql/**`)
- GraphQL server configuration (`**/server.*`, `**/app.*`, `**/index.*`)
- Middleware and plugins (`**/middleware/**`, `**/plugins/**`)
- Authorization directives (`**/directives/**`, `**/guards/**`)

### 2. Check for Available Scanners

Detect scanners per `../../shared/schemas/scanners.md`:

1. `semgrep` -- primary scanner for GraphQL patterns
2. `graphql-cop` -- specialized GraphQL security auditor (if available)

Record which scanners are available and which are missing.

### 3. Run Scanners (If Available)

If semgrep is available, run with rules targeting GraphQL:
```
semgrep scan --config auto --json --quiet <target>
```
Filter results to rules matching GraphQL security patterns. Normalize output
to the findings schema.

### 4. Claude Code Analysis

Regardless of scanner availability, perform manual code analysis:

1. **Introspection check**: Find GraphQL server configuration and verify
   introspection is disabled in production environments.
2. **Depth limiting**: Check for depth limiting middleware (graphql-depth-limit,
   @graphql-tools/utils, custom validation rules).
3. **Complexity analysis**: Verify query complexity is calculated and limited
   before execution (graphql-query-complexity, cost analysis).
4. **Batching controls**: Check whether query batching is enabled and if
   there are limits on the number of operations per request.
5. **Alias abuse**: Verify aliases are counted toward rate limiting and
   complexity calculations.
6. **Per-field authorization**: Trace resolvers for sensitive fields and verify
   each checks the requesting user's permissions.

When `--depth deep`, additionally trace:
- Full resolver chain from query to data source
- Authorization directive/guard coverage across all types and fields
- Subscription authentication and authorization

### 5. Report Findings

Format output per `../../shared/schemas/findings.md` using the `GQL` prefix
(e.g., `GQL-001`, `GQL-002`).

Include for each finding:
- Severity and confidence
- Exact file location with code snippet
- Exploit scenario (example malicious query when applicable)
- Concrete fix with diff when possible
- CWE references

## What to Look For

These are the high-signal patterns specific to GraphQL security. Each maps
to a detection pattern in `references/detection-patterns.md`.

1. **Introspection enabled in production** -- `__schema` and `__type` queries
   are accessible, revealing the entire API schema to attackers.

2. **No query depth limit** -- Deeply nested queries can exhaust server resources
   (e.g., `user { friends { friends { friends { ... } } } }`).

3. **No query complexity limit** -- Expensive queries with many fields or
   computed values can cause denial of service.

4. **Batching abuse** -- Multiple queries in a single request bypass per-request
   rate limiting and can brute-force authentication.

5. **Alias-based denial of service** -- Using aliases to repeat expensive
   fields/resolvers many times in a single query.

6. **Missing per-field authorization** -- Sensitive fields (email, SSN, balance)
   exposed to any authenticated user without field-level access checks.

## Scanner Integration

| Scanner | Coverage | Command |
|---------|----------|---------|
| semgrep | Introspection, missing auth directives | `semgrep scan --config auto --json --quiet <target>` |
| graphql-cop | Introspection, depth, batching, aliases | `graphql-cop -t <endpoint>` |

**Fallback (no scanner)**: Use Grep with patterns from `references/detection-patterns.md`
to find GraphQL server configuration, depth/complexity middleware, resolver
authorization, and batching settings. Report findings with `confidence: medium`.

## Output Format

Use the findings schema from `../../shared/schemas/findings.md`.

- **ID prefix**: `GQL` (e.g., `GQL-001`)
- **metadata.tool**: `graphql`
- **metadata.framework**: `specialized`
- **metadata.category**: `GQL`
- **references.cwe**: `CWE-200`, `CWE-400`, `CWE-862`
- **references.owasp**: `A05:2021` (Security Misconfiguration)
- **references.stride**: `I` (Information Disclosure) or `D` (Denial of Service)

Severity guidance for this category:
- **critical**: Missing per-field auth on sensitive data, introspection exposing internal schemas
- **high**: No depth or complexity limits, batching with no limits on auth endpoints
- **medium**: Introspection enabled in prod (non-sensitive schema), alias abuse possible
- **low**: Overly permissive but rate-limited batching, minor information disclosure
