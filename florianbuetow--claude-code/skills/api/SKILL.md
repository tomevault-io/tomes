# API Security (API)

Analyze REST and RPC APIs for security vulnerabilities aligned with the OWASP
API Security Top 10, including Broken Object-Level Authorization (BOLA), mass
assignment, missing rate limiting, broken function-level authorization, and
excessive data exposure. API-specific vulnerabilities arise from the unique
patterns of programmatic access, where client-side UI constraints do not apply.

## Supported Flags

Read `../../shared/schemas/flags.md` for the full flag specification. This skill
supports all cross-cutting flags. Key flags for this skill:

- `--scope` determines which files to analyze (default: `changed`)
- `--depth standard` reads code and checks API endpoint handlers
- `--depth deep` traces data from request to database to response serialization
- `--severity` filters output (API issues are often `high` or `critical`)

## Framework Context

Key CWEs in scope:
- CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key (BOLA)
- CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes
- CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits (rate limiting)
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization (function-level auth)
- CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information (excessive data)

OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023) categories:
- API1:2023 Broken Object-Level Authorization
- API2:2023 Broken Authentication
- API3:2023 Broken Object Property-Level Authorization
- API4:2023 Unrestricted Resource Consumption
- API5:2023 Broken Function-Level Authorization

## Detection Patterns

Read `references/detection-patterns.md` for the full catalog of code patterns,
search heuristics, language-specific examples, and false positive guidance.

## Workflow

### 1. Determine Scope

Parse flags and resolve the file list per `../../shared/schemas/flags.md`.
Filter to files likely to contain API logic:

- Route/endpoint definitions (`**/routes/**`, `**/api/**`, `**/endpoints/**`)
- Controllers and handlers (`**/controllers/**`, `**/handlers/**`, `**/views/**`)
- Serializers and DTOs (`**/serializers/**`, `**/dto/**`, `**/schemas/**`)
- Middleware (`**/middleware/**`, `**/middlewares/**`)
- Rate limiting configuration (`**/config/**`, `**/limiters/**`)

### 2. Check for Available Scanners

Detect scanners per `../../shared/schemas/scanners.md`:

1. `semgrep` -- primary scanner for API patterns
2. `bandit` -- Python API security issues
3. `brakeman` -- Rails API vulnerabilities

Record which scanners are available and which are missing.

### 3. Run Scanners (If Available)

If semgrep is available, run with rules targeting API security:
```
semgrep scan --config auto --json --quiet <target>
```
Filter results to rules matching BOLA, mass assignment, authorization, and
data exposure patterns. Normalize output to the findings schema.

### 4. Claude Code Analysis

Regardless of scanner availability, perform manual code analysis:

1. **BOLA audit**: Find API endpoints that accept resource IDs and verify each
   enforces ownership or authorization before returning/modifying data.
2. **Mass assignment**: Find endpoints that accept request bodies and bind them
   directly to models without explicit field allowlisting.
3. **Rate limiting**: Check for rate limiting middleware on authentication
   endpoints, data-intensive endpoints, and mutation endpoints.
4. **Function-level authorization**: Verify admin/privileged endpoints have
   role-based authorization, not just authentication.
5. **Excessive data exposure**: Check API responses for fields that should not
   be exposed (passwords, internal IDs, sensitive user data).

When `--depth deep`, additionally trace:
- Full request-to-response data flow including serialization
- Authorization middleware chains across all API routes
- Rate limiting configuration and bypass scenarios

### 5. Report Findings

Format output per `../../shared/schemas/findings.md` using the `API` prefix
(e.g., `API-001`, `API-002`).

Include for each finding:
- Severity and confidence
- Exact file location with code snippet
- OWASP API Top 10 reference
- Concrete fix with diff when possible
- CWE references

## What to Look For

These are the high-signal patterns specific to API security. Each maps
to a detection pattern in `references/detection-patterns.md`.

1. **Broken Object-Level Authorization (BOLA)** -- API endpoints accept a
   resource ID from the client and return data without verifying the requesting
   user owns or is authorized to access that resource.

2. **Mass assignment** -- Request body fields are bound directly to database
   model attributes, allowing attackers to set fields they should not control
   (role, price, isAdmin).

3. **Missing rate limiting** -- API endpoints lack rate limiting, allowing
   brute-force attacks on authentication, enumeration, and resource exhaustion.

4. **Broken function-level authorization** -- Admin or privileged API endpoints
   are accessible to regular users because they check authentication but not
   authorization role/permissions.

5. **Excessive data exposure** -- API responses include sensitive fields
   (password hashes, tokens, internal metadata) that the client does not need.

6. **Missing input validation** -- API endpoints accept unbounded inputs
   (no max length, no type validation) enabling injection and resource abuse.

## Scanner Integration

| Scanner | Coverage | Command |
|---------|----------|---------|
| semgrep | BOLA, mass assignment, missing auth | `semgrep scan --config auto --json --quiet <target>` |
| bandit | Python API security patterns | `bandit -r <target> -f json -q` |
| brakeman | Rails mass assignment, authorization | `brakeman -q -f json -o /dev/stdout` |

**Fallback (no scanner)**: Use Grep with patterns from `references/detection-patterns.md`
to find API route definitions, model binding, rate limiting config, and response
serialization. Report findings with `confidence: medium`.

## Output Format

Use the findings schema from `../../shared/schemas/findings.md`.

- **ID prefix**: `API` (e.g., `API-001`)
- **metadata.tool**: `api`
- **metadata.framework**: `api`
- **metadata.category**: `API`
- **references.api_top10**: `API1:2023`, `API3:2023`, etc.
- **references.cwe**: `CWE-639`, `CWE-915`, `CWE-770`
- **references.stride**: `I` (Information Disclosure) or `E` (Elevation of Privilege)

Severity guidance for this category:
- **critical**: BOLA on sensitive data (financial, medical, PII), mass assignment on role/privilege fields
- **high**: BOLA on user-scoped data, missing auth on admin endpoints, mass assignment on price/status
- **medium**: Missing rate limiting on auth endpoints, excessive data exposure of non-critical fields
- **low**: Minor data over-exposure, rate limit too generous but present
