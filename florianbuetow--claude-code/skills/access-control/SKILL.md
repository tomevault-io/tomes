# Broken Access Control (A01:2021)

Analyze source code for broken access control vulnerabilities including missing
authorization checks, insecure direct object references, CORS misconfiguration,
JWT manipulation, directory traversal, and privilege escalation.

## Supported Flags

Read `../../shared/schemas/flags.md` for the full flag specification. This skill
supports all cross-cutting flags. Key flags for this skill:

- `--scope` determines which files to analyze (default: `changed`)
- `--depth standard` reads code and checks middleware chains
- `--depth deep` traces authorization across call graphs and middleware stacks
- `--severity` filters output (access control issues are often `high` or `critical`)

## Framework Context

Read `../../shared/frameworks/owasp-top10-2021.md`, section **A01:2021 - Broken
Access Control**, for the full category description, common vulnerabilities, and
prevention guidance.

Key CWEs in scope:
- CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information
- CWE-284: Improper Access Control
- CWE-285: Improper Authorization
- CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery
- CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key (IDOR)
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
- CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization

## Detection Patterns

Read `references/detection-patterns.md` for the full catalog of code patterns,
search heuristics, language-specific examples, and false positive guidance.

## Workflow

### 1. Determine Scope

Parse flags and resolve the file list per `../../shared/schemas/flags.md`.
Filter to files likely to contain access control logic:

- Route/controller definitions (`**/routes/**`, `**/controllers/**`, `**/handlers/**`)
- Middleware files (`**/middleware/**`, `**/middlewares/**`)
- Authorization modules (`**/auth/**`, `**/authz/**`, `**/policies/**`, `**/guards/**`)
- API endpoint definitions (`**/api/**`, `**/endpoints/**`)
- Configuration files for CORS, JWT, and session management

### 2. Check for Available Scanners

Detect scanners per `../../shared/schemas/scanners.md`:

1. `semgrep` — primary scanner for access control patterns
2. `bandit` — Python-specific authorization issues
3. `brakeman` — Rails mass assignment and authorization bypasses

Record which scanners are available and which are missing.

### 3. Run Scanners (If Available)

If semgrep is available, run with rules targeting access control:
```
semgrep scan --config auto --json --quiet <target>
```
Filter results to rules matching access control, authorization, CORS, JWT, and
IDOR patterns. Normalize output to the findings schema.

### 4. Claude Code Analysis

Regardless of scanner availability, perform manual code analysis:

1. **Route inventory**: Grep for route definitions and check each has authorization middleware.
2. **Object access**: Find database lookups using user-supplied IDs and verify ownership checks.
3. **CORS config**: Locate CORS configuration and check for wildcard or overly permissive origins.
4. **JWT handling**: Find JWT verification code and check that claims are validated.
5. **Path handling**: Find file path operations using user input and check for traversal prevention.
6. **Role checks**: Identify role-based decisions and verify they cover both horizontal and vertical access.

When `--depth deep`, additionally trace:
- Full middleware chains from route to handler
- Authorization decorator/annotation inheritance
- Cross-service authorization delegation

### 5. Report Findings

Format output per `../../shared/schemas/findings.md` using the `AC` prefix
(e.g., `AC-001`, `AC-002`).

Include for each finding:
- Severity and confidence
- Exact file location with code snippet
- Impact description specific to the access control failure
- Concrete fix with diff when possible
- CWE and OWASP references

## What to Look For

These are the high-signal patterns specific to broken access control. Each
maps to a detection pattern in `references/detection-patterns.md`.

1. **Routes without authorization middleware** — Endpoints that handle sensitive
   data or mutations but have no auth middleware in their chain.

2. **Direct object references without ownership** — Database lookups using
   `req.params.id` or similar without filtering by the authenticated user.

3. **CORS wildcard or reflection** — `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` or
   reflecting the `Origin` header without validation, especially with credentials.

4. **JWT claims used without verification** — Reading JWT payload without
   verifying signature, or trusting client-supplied role/permission claims.

5. **Path traversal via user input** — File operations using user-supplied
   paths without canonicalization or allowlist validation.

6. **Missing function-level access control** — Admin endpoints accessible to
   regular users, or API actions without role verification.

7. **Forced browsing to predictable URLs** — Sequential IDs or predictable
   resource paths without authorization checks.

8. **Horizontal privilege escalation** — Users can access other users' data by
   changing an identifier, with no server-side ownership verification.

## Scanner Integration

| Scanner | Coverage | Command |
|---------|----------|---------|
| semgrep | IDOR, missing auth middleware, CORS, JWT issues | `semgrep scan --config auto --json --quiet <target>` |
| bandit | Python authorization patterns | `bandit -r <target> -f json -q` |
| brakeman | Rails mass assignment, authorization | `brakeman -q -f json -o /dev/stdout` |

**Fallback (no scanner)**: Use Grep with patterns from `references/detection-patterns.md`
to find route definitions, database queries with user-controlled IDs, CORS headers,
and JWT decode calls. Report findings with `confidence: medium`.

Relevant semgrep rule categories:
- `python.django.security.audit.unvalidated-*`
- `javascript.express.security.audit.missing-auth-*`
- `java.spring.security.audit.missing-authorization`
- `generic.cors.security.wildcard-origin`

## Output Format

Use the findings schema from `../../shared/schemas/findings.md`.

- **ID prefix**: `AC` (e.g., `AC-001`)
- **metadata.tool**: `access-control`
- **metadata.framework**: `owasp`
- **metadata.category**: `A01`
- **references.owasp**: `A01:2021`
- **references.stride**: `E` (Elevation of Privilege) or `I` (Information Disclosure)

Severity guidance for this category:
- **critical**: Unauthenticated access to admin functions, mass IDOR exposing all user data
- **high**: Authenticated IDOR, missing authorization on mutation endpoints, CORS with credentials + wildcard
- **medium**: CORS misconfiguration without credentials, missing rate limiting on auth endpoints
- **low**: Verbose error messages revealing authorization logic, minor forced browsing risks
