# Security Fix Generation

Generate concrete, production-ready code fixes for security findings. This
is not an advisory skill -- it produces actual code changes that resolve
vulnerabilities and offers to apply them via the Edit tool.

## Supported Flags

Read `../../shared/schemas/flags.md` for the full flag specification.

| Flag | Fix Behavior |
|------|-------------|
| `--scope` | Identifies which findings to fix. `file:<path>` fixes findings in that file. Default: all unfixed findings in `--scope changed`. |
| `--depth quick` | Generate minimal fix (single-line change, no refactoring). |
| `--depth standard` | Fix with surrounding improvements (add validation, improve error handling). |
| `--depth deep` | Standard + refactor surrounding code to prevent similar issues, add defensive checks. |
| `--depth expert` | Deep + generate regression test, add security comments, update related code paths. |
| `--severity` | Only fix findings at or above this severity. |
| `--format` | Default `text`. Use `json` to output fix objects matching findings schema. |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Target Finding

Resolve what to fix from user input. Accept any of these forms:

1. **Finding ID**: e.g., `INJ-001`. Read from `.appsec/findings.json` to load the finding.
2. **File and line**: e.g., `src/db/queries.ts:45`. Scan findings for a match, or analyze the location directly.
3. **Description**: e.g., "the SQL injection in the user lookup". Search findings by title/description.
4. **Batch mode**: No specific target means fix all findings in scope, ordered by severity (critical first).

If no findings exist in `.appsec/findings.json`, analyze the target location directly to identify the vulnerability before generating a fix.

### Step 2: Understand the Vulnerability

For each finding to fix:

1. **Read the finding record** (if it exists): severity, CWE, description, location, snippet.
2. **Read the vulnerable code**: Use the Read tool to load the file. Read at least 30 lines of surrounding context.
3. **Identify the root cause**: What specific coding pattern causes the vulnerability?
4. **Identify constraints**: What does the code need to do? What are the inputs/outputs? What framework/library is in use?
5. **Check for existing mitigations**: Is there partial validation? A security library already imported? Framework-level protection available?

### Step 3: Select Fix Strategy

Choose the most appropriate fix strategy based on the vulnerability type:

| Vulnerability | Preferred Fix Strategy |
|--------------|----------------------|
| SQL Injection (CWE-89) | Parameterized queries / prepared statements |
| XSS (CWE-79) | Context-aware output encoding, CSP headers |
| Command Injection (CWE-78) | Allowlist validation, avoid shell execution, use library APIs |
| Path Traversal (CWE-22) | Canonicalize + validate against base directory |
| SSRF (CWE-918) | URL allowlist, disable redirects, validate scheme/host |
| Insecure Deserialization (CWE-502) | Type-safe deserialization, allowlisted classes |
| Hardcoded Secrets (CWE-798) | Environment variables or secret manager references |
| Missing Auth (CWE-306) | Add authentication middleware/decorator |
| Broken Access Control (CWE-862) | Add authorization check before resource access |
| Weak Crypto (CWE-327) | Replace with current recommended algorithm |
| Open Redirect (CWE-601) | Validate redirect target against allowlist |
| Race Condition (CWE-362) | Add locking, use atomic operations |

### Step 4: Generate the Fix

Produce a concrete code change:

1. **Write the actual fixed code.** Not pseudocode, not advice -- real code that compiles/runs.
2. **Match the existing code style**: indentation, naming conventions, import style, error handling patterns.
3. **Use framework-idiomatic solutions**: If Express, use Express middleware. If Django, use Django's ORM parameterization. If React, use React's built-in XSS protection.
4. **Minimize blast radius**: Change only what is necessary. Do not refactor unrelated code (unless `--depth deep` or `expert`).
5. **Add imports** if the fix requires new dependencies. Note if a package install is needed.
6. **Preserve functionality**: The fix must not break the code's intended behavior.

### Step 5: Validate the Fix

Before presenting:

1. **Syntax check**: Ensure the generated code is syntactically valid.
2. **Completeness check**: Does the fix fully resolve the finding, or is it partial?
3. **Side effect check**: Could the fix break other functionality? Flag if so.
4. **Regression check**: Could the fix introduce a new vulnerability? (e.g., overly permissive allowlist).

### Step 6: Present and Apply

Present the fix to the user:

```
## Fix: <Finding ID> - <Title>

**Severity**: <severity> | **CWE**: <CWE-ID> | **File**: <path>

### Root Cause
<1-2 sentence explanation>

### Fix
<description of what the fix does>

```diff
- <old code>
+ <new code>
```

### Additional Changes (if any)
- New import: `<import statement>`
- New dependency: `<package>` (run `<install command>`)
```

Then ask: "Apply this fix?" If the user confirms (or `--fix` flag was passed from a parent skill), use the Edit tool to apply the change.

### Step 7: Update Finding Record

After applying a fix:

1. Update the finding in `.appsec/findings.json` with status `fix-applied`.
2. Add `fix.applied_at` timestamp and `fix.diff` with the actual change made.
3. Inform the user to run `/appsec:verify` to confirm the fix resolves the issue.

## Output Format

Findings follow `../../shared/schemas/findings.md`. When outputting fixes:

- `fix.summary`: One-line description of the fix.
- `fix.diff`: Unified diff of the change.
- `metadata.tool`: `"fix"`

Finding ID prefix: **FIX** (e.g., `FIX-001`) for new findings discovered during fix analysis. Fixes to existing findings retain the original finding ID.

## Pragmatism Notes

- Prefer the simplest correct fix. A one-line parameterized query beats a custom sanitization function.
- If a framework provides a built-in security mechanism, use it rather than hand-rolling.
- When multiple fix strategies exist, prefer the one already used elsewhere in the codebase for consistency.
- If the fix requires an architectural change beyond a single file, describe the full change but only apply the immediate file-level fix. Note the broader change needed.
- Never generate fixes that simply suppress warnings or disable security features.
- If unsure about a fix's correctness, present it with caveats rather than applying silently.
