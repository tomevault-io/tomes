# Attack Surface Mapping

Discover and inventory every entry point where external data enters the
application. Produces a ranked catalog of all routes, APIs, input handlers,
and external interfaces organized by exposure level and trust boundary.

## Supported Flags

Read `../../shared/schemas/flags.md` for the full flag specification.

| Flag | Attack Surface Behavior |
|------|------------------------|
| `--scope` | Default `full`. Attack surface mapping benefits from whole-codebase visibility. Narrow scopes produce partial inventories with a warning. |
| `--depth quick` | Framework route extraction only (Grep for route decorators and definitions). |
| `--depth standard` | Route extraction + read handlers to classify input types and auth requirements. |
| `--depth deep` | Standard + trace each entry point to internal sinks, map trust boundary crossings. |
| `--depth expert` | Deep + rank by exploitability, identify shadow/undocumented endpoints, DREAD scoring. |
| `--severity` | Not directly applicable. Used to filter the exposure ranking in output. |
| `--format` | Default `text`. Use `json` for machine-readable inventory, `md` for wiki export. |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Scope

1. Parse `--scope` flag. Default to `full` for this skill (attack surface requires broad visibility).
2. Resolve to a concrete file list.
3. Prioritize discovery in: route files, controller directories, API definitions, middleware,
   OpenAPI/Swagger specs, GraphQL schemas, gRPC proto files, CLI entry points, WebSocket handlers.

### Step 2: Discover Framework and Language

Identify the application framework(s) to determine route registration patterns:

| Framework | Route Pattern |
|-----------|--------------|
| Express/Koa/Fastify | `app.get()`, `router.post()`, `fastify.route()` |
| Django | `urlpatterns`, `path()`, `re_path()`, `@api_view` |
| Flask | `@app.route()`, `@blueprint.route()` |
| Spring | `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@RequestMapping` |
| Rails | `routes.rb`, `resources :`, `get '/'` |
| Next.js/Nuxt | `pages/` and `app/` directory conventions, `route.ts` |
| ASP.NET | `[HttpGet]`, `[Route]`, `MapGet()`, `MapPost()` |
| Go net/http | `http.HandleFunc()`, `mux.Handle()`, gorilla/chi patterns |
| FastAPI | `@app.get()`, `@router.post()` |
| gRPC | `.proto` service definitions, generated server stubs |
| GraphQL | Schema definitions, resolver registrations |

### Step 3: Extract Entry Points

For each framework detected, systematically extract all entry points:

1. **HTTP Routes**: Method, path, handler function, middleware chain.
2. **API Endpoints**: REST, GraphQL queries/mutations, gRPC services.
3. **Form Handlers**: HTML form action targets, multipart upload handlers.
4. **File Upload Endpoints**: Endpoints accepting file data, storage destinations.
5. **WebSocket Handlers**: Connection endpoints, message handlers.
6. **CLI Arguments**: Argument parsers (`argparse`, `commander`, `cobra`, `clap`).
7. **Message Queue Consumers**: Kafka/RabbitMQ/SQS message handlers.
8. **Scheduled Tasks**: Cron jobs, scheduled functions that process external data.
9. **Webhook Receivers**: Endpoints accepting callbacks from external services.
10. **Server-Sent Events**: SSE endpoints, streaming responses.

### Step 4: Classify Each Entry Point

For every discovered entry point, determine:

1. **Authentication**: None, API key, session, JWT, OAuth, mTLS, or unknown.
2. **Authorization**: None, role-based, attribute-based, or unknown.
3. **Input Types**: Query params, path params, headers, body (JSON/XML/form), files, cookies.
4. **Validation**: Present (with details) or absent.
5. **Rate Limiting**: Present or absent.
6. **Network Exposure**: Internet-facing, internal network, localhost only.
7. **Protocol**: HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, gRPC, raw TCP, message queue.

### Step 5: Rank by Exposure

Assign an exposure level to each entry point:

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Internet-facing, no authentication, accepts user input, interacts with sensitive data or system resources |
| **HIGH** | Internet-facing with authentication but handling sensitive data, or unauthenticated endpoints with limited input validation |
| **MEDIUM** | Authenticated endpoints with proper validation, or internal endpoints with no authentication |
| **LOW** | Internal endpoints with authentication, limited input surface, or read-only operations on non-sensitive data |

At `--depth deep` and `--depth expert`, trace each HIGH/CRITICAL entry point
inward to identify what sinks they reach (databases, file system, external
services, system commands).

### Step 6: Identify Shadow Endpoints

At `--depth expert`, look for:

- Debug/admin routes not behind auth middleware (e.g., `/debug`, `/admin`, `/metrics`, `/health` exposing internals).
- Routes registered dynamically or via reflection that don't appear in static route lists.
- Endpoints in test/staging configuration that may be active in production.
- API versions that are deprecated but still routed.
- OpenAPI/Swagger UI exposed without authentication.

### Step 7: Report

Output the attack surface inventory.

## Output Format

This skill produces an **inventory**, not vulnerability findings. However, when
entry points have clearly missing security controls (no auth on sensitive
endpoints), emit findings using the standard schema from `../../shared/schemas/findings.md`.

Finding ID prefix: **SURF** (e.g., `SURF-001`).

### Inventory Table

```
## Attack Surface Inventory

### Summary
- Total entry points: N
- Internet-facing: N (N unauthenticated)
- Internal: N
- Exposure: N CRITICAL, N HIGH, N MEDIUM, N LOW

### Entry Points by Exposure

| # | Method | Path | Auth | Input Types | Validation | Rate Limit | Exposure |
|---|--------|------|------|-------------|------------|------------|----------|
| 1 | POST | /api/v1/users | None | JSON body | None | No | CRITICAL |
| 2 | GET | /api/v1/users/:id | JWT | Path param | Partial | Yes | MEDIUM |
| ... |

### Trust Boundary Map (--depth deep)
[Mermaid diagram showing entry points grouped by trust boundary]

### Shadow Endpoints (--depth expert)
[Undocumented or debug endpoints discovered]

### Findings
[Standard findings for missing security controls on entry points]
```

Findings follow `../../shared/schemas/findings.md` with:
- `metadata.tool`: `"attack-surface"`
- `metadata.framework`: depends on invoking context (or `null` if standalone)
- `references.cwe`: `CWE-16` (Configuration), `CWE-306` (Missing Authentication)

## Pragmatism Notes

- Health check endpoints (`/health`, `/ready`) without auth are normal in container orchestration.
  Only flag if they expose sensitive internal state.
- Internal APIs behind a service mesh or VPN still warrant inventory but at lower exposure.
- CLI tools that only run locally have minimal attack surface unless they parse untrusted files.
- Static file serving endpoints are low priority unless directory traversal is possible.
