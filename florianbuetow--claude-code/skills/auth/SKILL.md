# Identification and Authentication Failures

Analyze source code for authentication and session management vulnerabilities. Detect
weak credential handling, missing brute force protections, insecure session management,
and absent multi-factor authentication. Produce actionable findings with severity
ratings, code locations, and concrete remediation steps.

## Supported Flags

All flags from `../../shared/schemas/flags.md` are supported:

| Flag | Relevant Behavior |
|------|-------------------|
| `--scope <value>` | Determines which files to analyze (default: `changed`) |
| `--depth <value>` | `quick`: pattern scan only. `standard`: full read + analysis. `deep`: trace auth flows cross-file. `expert`: red team simulation with DREAD scoring |
| `--severity <value>` | Filter findings by minimum severity |
| `--format <value>` | Output format: `text`, `json`, `sarif`, `md` |
| `--fix` | Chain into remediation after analysis |
| `--quiet` | Findings only, no explanations |
| `--explain` | Add learning context to each finding |

## Framework Context

**OWASP Top 10 2021 - A07: Identification and Authentication Failures**

Confirmation of the user's identity, authentication, and session management is critical
to protect against authentication-related attacks. Applications are vulnerable when they:

- Permit automated attacks such as credential stuffing or brute force
- Permit default, weak, or well-known passwords
- Use weak credential recovery processes (e.g., knowledge-based answers)
- Store passwords in plain text, encrypted, or with weak hashes (MD5, SHA1)
- Lack or have ineffective multi-factor authentication
- Expose session identifiers in URLs
- Reuse session identifiers after successful login
- Fail to properly invalidate sessions on logout or timeout

**STRIDE Mapping**: Spoofing, Repudiation

**CWE References**: CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), CWE-384 (Session Fixation),
CWE-307 (Brute Force), CWE-521 (Weak Password Requirements), CWE-916 (Weak Password Hash),
CWE-613 (Insufficient Session Expiration), CWE-308 (Missing MFA)

## Detection Patterns

Read [`references/detection-patterns.md`](references/detection-patterns.md) before
performing analysis. It contains detailed Grep heuristics, language-specific code
examples, scanner coverage, and false positive guidance for each vulnerability pattern.

## Workflow

### 1. Determine Scope

Parse `--scope` flag and resolve to a concrete file list:

1. Apply scope resolution per `../../shared/schemas/flags.md`.
2. Filter to files relevant to authentication:
   - Route handlers, middleware, and controllers (login, register, password reset endpoints)
   - Authentication modules and services
   - Session configuration files
   - Password hashing and validation utilities
   - JWT/token generation and validation code
   - OAuth/OIDC integration code
   - Configuration files (session timeout, password policy settings)
3. Include framework-specific auth files (e.g., `passport.js` configs, Django `auth` backends,
   Spring Security configs, Go `auth` middleware).

### 2. Check for Scanners

Detect available scanners in order of preference:

| Scanner | Detect | Relevant Rules |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| semgrep | `which semgrep` | Auth bypass, weak hashing, JWT issues, session management |
| bandit | `which bandit` | Hardcoded passwords, weak hashes (Python) |
| gosec | `which gosec` | Hardcoded credentials, weak crypto (Go) |
| gitleaks | `which gitleaks` | Hardcoded secrets, API keys, passwords in code |

If no scanner is available, proceed with Claude analysis using Grep patterns from
`references/detection-patterns.md`. Note in output: "No scanner available -- findings
based on code pattern analysis only."

### 3. Run Scanners

For each available scanner:

1. Execute against the scoped file list.
2. Parse JSON output.
3. Filter to authentication-related rules only.
4. Normalize findings to the schema in `../../shared/schemas/findings.md`.
5. Set `scanner.confirmed: true` for scanner-detected findings.

### 4. Claude Analysis

Regardless of scanner availability, perform manual code analysis:

1. Read `references/detection-patterns.md` for the full pattern catalog.
2. Use Grep with the regex patterns to locate suspicious constructs.
3. Read surrounding code context (30-50 lines) to assess each match.
4. Trace authentication flows from entry point to credential validation.
5. At `--depth deep` or higher: follow imports, trace session lifecycle, map the
   complete auth flow across files.
6. Deduplicate against scanner findings (same file + line = same finding).
7. Set `confidence: medium` for Claude-only findings, `confidence: high` when
   confirmed by a scanner.

### 5. Report Findings

Format output per `--format` flag. Each finding uses the schema from
`../../shared/schemas/findings.md` with these specifics:

- **ID prefix**: `AUTH` (e.g., `AUTH-001`, `AUTH-002`)
- **references.owasp**: `A07:2021`
- **references.stride**: `S` (Spoofing) or `R` (Repudiation)
- **metadata.tool**: `auth`
- **metadata.framework**: `owasp`
- **metadata.category**: `A07`

**Summary block** (appended after all findings):

```
## Summary

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| CRITICAL | N     |
| HIGH     | N     |
| MEDIUM   | N     |
| LOW      | N     |

**Scanners used**: [list or "none"]
**Scanners missing**: [list of recommended but unavailable]
**Top priorities**: [top 3 findings to fix first and why]
```

## What to Look For

These are the primary vulnerability patterns. See `references/detection-patterns.md`
for detailed regex patterns and code examples.

1. **Missing rate limiting on login** -- No throttling, delay, or account lockout on
   authentication endpoints, enabling brute force and credential stuffing.
2. **Weak password validation** -- No complexity requirements, missing minimum length
   checks, or no check against common password lists.
3. **Plaintext or weakly hashed passwords** -- Passwords stored with MD5, SHA1, plain
   SHA256, or without salting. Must use Argon2, bcrypt, or scrypt.
4. **Session ID in URL parameters** -- Session tokens passed via query strings, visible
   in logs, referrer headers, and browser history.
5. **Missing session regeneration after login** -- Same session ID used before and after
   authentication, enabling session fixation attacks.
6. **JWT with none algorithm accepted** -- JWT verification allows `alg: "none"`, letting
   attackers forge unsigned tokens.
7. **Hardcoded JWT secrets** -- Signing keys embedded in source code rather than loaded
   from environment or secrets management.
8. **Missing or ineffective MFA** -- No multi-factor authentication on sensitive
   operations, or MFA that can be bypassed.
9. **Insufficient session invalidation** -- Sessions not destroyed on logout, or no
   server-side session expiration/timeout.

## Scanner Integration

Refer to `../../shared/schemas/scanners.md` for full scanner details.

**Primary**: semgrep (broad auth rule coverage across languages)
**Secondary**: bandit (Python), gosec (Go), gitleaks (hardcoded credentials)
**Fallback**: Grep-based pattern matching from `references/detection-patterns.md`

When running as a subagent of the OWASP dispatcher, receive scope and flags from the
parent agent prompt. Do not re-parse user input.

## Output Format

All findings conform to the schema defined in `../../shared/schemas/findings.md`.

**ID prefix**: `AUTH` (registered in the ID Prefix Registry as OWASP A07)

Example finding:

```json
{
  "id": "AUTH-001",
  "title": "Passwords hashed with MD5 in user registration",
  "severity": "critical",
  "confidence": "high",
  "location": {
    "file": "src/auth/register.py",
    "line": 34,
    "function": "create_user",
    "snippet": "password_hash = hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()"
  },
  "description": "User passwords are hashed with MD5, which is cryptographically broken and trivially reversible with rainbow tables or GPU cracking.",
  "impact": "An attacker with database access can recover all user passwords within minutes, enabling account takeover across the application and any services where users reuse passwords.",
  "fix": {
    "summary": "Replace MD5 with bcrypt or Argon2id",
    "diff": "- password_hash = hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()\n+ password_hash = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt())"
  },
  "references": {
    "cwe": "CWE-916",

    "stride": "S"
  },
