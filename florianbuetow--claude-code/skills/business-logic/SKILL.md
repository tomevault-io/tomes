# Business Logic Security (BIZ)

Analyze application business logic for security vulnerabilities including
workflow step bypassing, negative amount manipulation, coupon/discount abuse,
self-referral exploitation, state machine manipulation, and time-based logic
exploits. Business logic flaws are unique to each application and cannot be
detected by generic scanners -- they require understanding the intended
workflow and finding ways to subvert it.

## Supported Flags

Read `../../shared/schemas/flags.md` for the full flag specification. This skill
supports all cross-cutting flags. Key flags for this skill:

- `--scope` determines which files to analyze (default: `changed`)
- `--depth standard` reads code and checks business rule implementations
- `--depth deep` traces full workflows from initiation through completion
- `--severity` filters output (business logic issues are often `high` or `critical`)

## Framework Context

Key CWEs in scope:
- CWE-840: Business Logic Errors
- CWE-841: Improper Enforcement of Behavioral Workflow
- CWE-799: Improper Control of Interaction Frequency
- CWE-837: Improper Enforcement of a Single, Unique Action
- CWE-20: Improper Input Validation

## Detection Patterns

Read `references/detection-patterns.md` for the full catalog of code patterns,
search heuristics, language-specific examples, and false positive guidance.

## Workflow

### 1. Determine Scope

Parse flags and resolve the file list per `../../shared/schemas/flags.md`.
Filter to files likely to contain business logic:

- Payment and checkout (`**/payments/**`, `**/checkout/**`, `**/billing/**`)
- Order processing (`**/orders/**`, `**/cart/**`, `**/transactions/**`)
- Discount and coupon logic (`**/coupons/**`, `**/discounts/**`, `**/promotions/**`)
- Referral and reward systems (`**/referrals/**`, `**/rewards/**`, `**/loyalty/**`)
- Workflow and state machines (`**/workflows/**`, `**/state/**`, `**/status/**`)
- User account operations (`**/accounts/**`, `**/profiles/**`)

### 2. Check for Available Scanners

Detect scanners per `../../shared/schemas/scanners.md`:

1. `semgrep` -- custom rules can catch some business logic patterns

Record which scanners are available. Business logic flaws are primarily
detected through manual code analysis, not automated scanners.

### 3. Run Scanners (If Available)

If semgrep is available, run with rules targeting business logic:
```
semgrep scan --config auto --json --quiet <target>
```
Filter for rules matching validation, state management, and numeric handling
patterns. Normalize output to the findings schema.

### 4. Claude Code Analysis

This is the primary detection method for business logic flaws:

1. **Workflow step bypass**: Map multi-step workflows (checkout, verification,
   approval) and verify each step cannot be skipped by calling later steps directly.
2. **Negative amount manipulation**: Find numeric inputs (amounts, quantities,
   prices) and verify the application rejects negative values.
3. **Coupon/discount abuse**: Find discount application logic and verify
   coupons cannot be applied multiple times, stacked beyond limits, or used
   after expiration.
4. **Self-referral exploitation**: Find referral systems and verify users
   cannot refer themselves or create circular referral chains.
5. **State machine integrity**: Map state transitions and verify invalid
   transitions are rejected (e.g., "shipped" cannot go back to "pending").
6. **Time-based logic**: Find logic depending on timestamps and verify it
   handles timezone manipulation, clock skew, and deadline race conditions.

When `--depth deep`, additionally trace:
- Full workflow paths from start to completion
- All possible state transitions and their guards
- Cross-endpoint workflow manipulation scenarios

### 5. Report Findings

Format output per `../../shared/schemas/findings.md` using the `BIZ` prefix
(e.g., `BIZ-001`, `BIZ-002`).

Include for each finding:
- Severity and confidence
- Exact file location with code snippet
- Step-by-step exploit scenario
- Business impact (financial loss, unfair advantage)
- Concrete fix with diff when possible
- CWE references

## What to Look For

These are the high-signal patterns specific to business logic security. Each
maps to a detection pattern in `references/detection-patterns.md`.

1. **Workflow step bypass** -- Multi-step processes where a later step can be
   invoked directly without completing prior steps.

2. **Negative amount manipulation** -- Numeric inputs accepted without sign
   validation, allowing negative amounts to reverse charges or increase balances.

3. **Coupon/discount abuse** -- Discount codes applied multiple times, stacked
   beyond intended limits, or used on ineligible items.

4. **Self-referral exploitation** -- Referral reward systems that do not prevent
   users from referring themselves or creating fake referral chains.

5. **State machine manipulation** -- Invalid state transitions accepted by the
   system (e.g., marking an order as "delivered" before "shipped").

6. **Time-based logic exploits** -- Logic dependent on client-supplied
   timestamps, exploitable timezone handling, or deadline race conditions.

7. **Price manipulation** -- Client-supplied prices accepted without server-side
   verification against the product catalog.

8. **Quantity abuse** -- No limits on quantities enabling abuse (ordering
   negative quantities, exceeding stock, zero-quantity orders).

## Scanner Integration

| Scanner | Coverage | Command |
|---------|----------|---------|
| semgrep | Numeric validation, some state patterns | `semgrep scan --config auto --json --quiet <target>` |

**Fallback (no scanner)**: Business logic flaws require manual code analysis.
Use Grep with patterns from `references/detection-patterns.md` to find
financial operations, state transitions, discount logic, and referral systems.
Report findings with `confidence: medium`.

## Output Format

Use the findings schema from `../../shared/schemas/findings.md`.

- **ID prefix**: `BIZ` (e.g., `BIZ-001`)
- **metadata.tool**: `business-logic`
- **metadata.framework**: `specialized`
- **metadata.category**: `BIZ`
- **references.cwe**: `CWE-840`, `CWE-841`
- **references.owasp**: `A04:2021` (Insecure Design)
- **references.stride**: `T` (Tampering) or `E` (Elevation of Privilege)

Severity guidance for this category:
- **critical**: Direct financial loss (negative amounts in payments, price manipulation)
- **high**: Workflow bypass on security-critical processes, unlimited discount stacking
- **medium**: Self-referral abuse, state manipulation with limited business impact
- **low**: Minor workflow inconsistencies, cosmetic state issues
