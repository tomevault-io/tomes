# Document Ingestion Skill

Turn external documents into structured, linkable knowledge notes with semantic deduplication.

## Quick Start

```
/ingest ~/Downloads/attention-paper.pdf
/ingest https://example.com/api-docs --internal
/ingest spec.docx --title "API Specification v2"
/ingest paper.pdf --dry-run  # Preview without writing
```

## Features

- **Semantic deduplication**: Merges similar concepts instead of creating duplicates
- **Atomic notes**: Extracts 3-15 typed concepts per document
- **Multi-source accumulation**: Concepts grow richer with each new source
- **Dual mode**: Literature (research) vs Internal (team docs)

## Modes

- **Literature** (default): Creates `literature/lit-{slug}.md` for external research, papers, articles
- **Internal** (`--internal`): Creates `internal/int-{slug}.md` for team docs, internal specs, processes

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `[file-or-url]` | Path to document (.pdf, .docx, .md, .txt) or URL |
| `--internal` | Create internal note instead of literature note |
| `--title "..."` | Override the note title (default: derived from filename/URL) |
| `--dry-run` | Preview what would be extracted without writing files |

## Prerequisites

This skill requires `claude-note` CLI for full functionality (deduplication, PDF parsing).

Check if installed:
```bash
claude-note --version
```

Install if needed:
```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv tool install git+https://github.com/crimeacs/claude-note.git

# Or using pipx
pipx install git+https://github.com/crimeacs/claude-note.git
```

**Without CLI**: The skill still works for basic ingestion using built-in tools (pdftotext, pandoc), but advanced features like semantic deduplication require the CLI.

## Process

When the user invokes `/ingest`, follow these steps:

### 1. Read the Document

**For files:**
- Use the Read tool for `.md` and `.txt` files
- For `.pdf` files: use Bash with `pdftotext` or `pandoc` to extract text
- For `.docx` files: use Bash with `pandoc -t plain` to extract text

**For URLs:**
- Use WebFetch to retrieve the content

### 2. Get Configuration

Read the vault path from `~/.config/claude-note/config.toml`:
```bash
cat ~/.config/claude-note/config.toml
```

Look for `vault_root = "..."` to find where notes should be created.

If no config exists, ask the user where to create notes.

### 3. Extract Knowledge

Analyze the content and extract:
- **Summary**: 2-3 sentence overview of what the document covers
- **Key Concepts**: Main ideas, terminology, and definitions (3-7 concepts)
- **Highlights**: Important findings, quotes, or actionable insights
- **Questions**: Open questions or things worth exploring further
- **Related Topics**: Connections to other knowledge areas

### 4. Check for Duplicates

Before creating a new note, check if a similar note exists:
```bash
ls {vault_path}/literature/ 2>/dev/null | grep -i "{keywords}"
ls {vault_path}/internal/ 2>/dev/null | grep -i "{keywords}"
```

If a similar note exists, ask the user if they want to:
1. Merge new content into the existing note
2. Create a separate note anyway
3. Cancel

### 5. Create the Note

Write a structured note using the appropriate format:
- Literature notes: See [literature-format.md](references/literature-format.md)
- Internal notes: See [internal-format.md](references/internal-format.md)

**Filename conventions:**
- Literature: `literature/lit-{slug}.md`
- Internal: `internal/int-{slug}.md`

Where `{slug}` is a kebab-case version of the title (max 50 chars).

### 6. Confirm

Tell the user what was created and offer to open the note.

## Example Workflow

User: `/ingest ~/Downloads/transformer-paper.pdf`

1. Extract text from PDF:
   ```bash
   pdftotext ~/Downloads/transformer-paper.pdf - 2>/dev/null || pandoc ~/Downloads/transformer-paper.pdf -t plain
   ```

2. Read config:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.config/claude-note/config.toml
   ```

3. Analyze the content and extract knowledge

4. Create note at `{vault_root}/literature/lit-attention-is-all-you-need.md`

5. Confirm to user what was created

## URL Ingestion

For URLs, use WebFetch to get the content:

```
/ingest https://docs.example.com/api-guide --internal
```

WebFetch will retrieve the content, then follow the same extraction process.

## Dry Run

Preview what would be extracted without writing files:

```
/ingest paper.pdf --dry-run
```

This shows the extracted knowledge and where it would be saved, but doesn't create any files.

## Tips

- Use descriptive filenames or `--title` for better slugs
- Review created notes and add manual annotations
- Link to existing topic notes in your vault using `[[note-name]]` syntax
- For large documents, focus on the most important 3-5 concepts
- Use `--dry-run` to preview before committing

## CLI Alternative

For batch processing or automation, use the CLI command instead:
```bash
claude-note ingest ~/papers/*.pdf
```

The CLI calls Claude API programmatically and is better for processing multiple documents.
