# Sync & Improve Documentation

Synchronize and continuously improve README.md, CLAUDE.md, help system docs,
and language reference with the actual kaish codebase. The source of truth is
always the code — docs follow. But don't just sync mechanically: apply kaizen.
Every pass should leave docs clearer, more accurate, and more welcoming.

## Document Audiences

Each document has a primary audience. Optimize for that audience:

| Document | Primary Audience | Optimize For |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| **README.md** | **Humans** (developers discovering the project) | Clarity, invitation, first impressions. This is the front door. |
| **CLAUDE.md** | **Claude / LLM agents** working in the codebase | Efficient orientation: architecture, conventions, build commands. What an agent needs to be productive immediately. |
| **`docs/help/*.md`** | **LLM agents** consuming kaish via MCP | **Token density.** Every token costs money and context window. Pack maximum useful information per token. No filler, no preamble, no "this document describes...". |
| **`docs/LANGUAGE.md`** | **Both** humans and agents | Complete language reference with working examples. |
| **`help.rs`** | **Runtime** (agents calling `help builtins`) | Correct categorization of every registered tool. |

> **Key distinction:** README.md sells kaish to humans. CLAUDE.md orients
> agents to work *on* kaish. Don't mix these concerns. README doesn't need
> crate internals; CLAUDE.md doesn't need marketing copy.

## Sources of Truth

| What | Canonical Location |
|------|-------------------|
| Registered builtins | `crates/kaish-kernel/src/tools/builtin/mod.rs` → `register_builtins()` |
| Tool schemas (names, params, descriptions) | `crates/kaish-kernel/src/tools/builtin/*.rs` → `fn schema()` |
| Help categorization | `crates/kaish-kernel/src/help.rs` → `format_tool_list()` match arms |
| Language syntax | `crates/kaish-kernel/src/` (lexer, parser, interpreter) |
| VFS mounts | `crates/kaish-kernel/src/vfs/` |
| Help content (compiled in) | `crates/kaish-kernel/docs/help/*.md` |

## Category Mapping — Do Not Unify

> **README.md and help.rs use different category schemes. This is intentional.
> Do NOT try to make them match.** Each serves its audience:

| help.rs Category | README Category | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Text Processing | Text | Same tools |
| Files & Directories | Files | Same tools |
| JSON | JSON | Same |
| Processes & Jobs | Git + part of System | README gives git its own row |
| Parallel (散/集) | Parallel | Same |
| Shell & System | System | README merges more here |
| Introspection | Meta | Different label, similar scope |

README groups for human scanning. help.rs groups for agent runtime display.

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Quick Check (do this first!)

Before launching the full workflow, do a fast sanity check:

1. Count `registry.register(...)` calls in `register_builtins()`
2. Count tools in the README builtin table
3. Count match arms in `help.rs` `format_tool_list()`
4. Check `ls crates/` against CLAUDE.md crate structure

**If all counts match and no new crates exist**, skip the deep inventory
(Phase 1 agents) and go directly to Phase 2's Gemini review + typo scan.
Report findings and stop if nothing needs fixing — don't force work that
isn't needed.

### Phase 1: Gather (2 parallel subagents)

Only needed when Phase 0 found mismatches, or after significant code changes.

**Agent 1 — Builtin inventory + categorization** (subagent_type: `Explore`):
Read `register_builtins()` in `mod.rs`. Extract every registered tool name
and count. Also read `format_tool_list()` in `help.rs` to get the current
category match arms. Report any tools not in a category.

**Agent 2 — Doc state** (subagent_type: `Explore`):
Read `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`. Extract the builtin table, feature claims,
crate structure, examples, and architecture description. Note anything that
could be stale.

**Do NOT re-inventory builtins from help files.** Agent 1 already has the
canonical list. Help file review (Phase 2) checks content quality, not
tool coverage.

### Phase 2: Diff & Review

Compare inventories from Phase 1 and identify:
- Tools in code but missing from README table or help.rs categories
- Tools in README/docs but removed from code
- Stale examples referencing removed tools or outdated syntax
- CLAUDE.md crate list not matching actual `crates/` directory
- Feature claims that no longer match implementation

#### Gemini Review (always run this)

Use `consult_gemini_pro` to review README.md quality. Feed it the file and ask:

> Review this README.md for a shell project called kaish. Critique it as if
> you're a developer seeing it for the first time. Is the value proposition
> clear? Are the examples inviting? Is anything confusing or missing? Would
> you want to try it?

Also useful: feed Gemini the `docs/help/*.md` files and ask whether they'd be
useful to an LLM agent encountering kaish for the first time.

#### Help File Quality Check

Help files are consumed by LLM agents paying per-token. Optimize ruthlessly
for information density. Humans who need help can just ask Claude.

Review each help file for content quality (not builtin coverage — that's
handled by the table sync):
- **Token density:** cut filler, preamble, meta-commentary. Lead with facts.
- Are examples current and working? One clear example > three weak ones.
- Is anything thin, unclear, or missing context?
- Does limits.md reflect actual current limitations?
- Does overview.md topic list match `help.rs` topics?

### Phase 3: Apply Fixes

**If Phase 2 found nothing:** report "docs are in sync" and stop. Don't
manufacture work.

**If fixes are needed**, apply them. For each document, respect its audience:

**README.md** (for humans):
- Update builtin table to match code
- Verify quick tour examples actually run
- Check feature claims match implementation
- Improve clarity for newcomers

**CLAUDE.md** (for agents):
- Update crate structure to match `crates/`
- Verify architecture description is current
- Update build commands if changed
- Check documentation pointers still resolve

**help.rs categorization:**
- Ensure every registered builtin appears in exactly one category match arm
- New tools must not silently fall to "Other"

**Help files (`docs/help/*.md`)** — optimize for token density:
- Verify examples use current syntax
- Cut filler phrases ("In order to", "It should be noted that", "This section describes")
- Lead with the useful information, not meta-commentary about the document
- Prefer tables and structured formats over prose where equivalent
- One good example beats three mediocre ones
- Check limits.md reflects actual limitations
- Ensure overview.md topic list matches help topics

**docs/LANGUAGE.md:**
- Cross-check syntax against parser
- Verify examples work
- Fill gaps for undocumented features

Apply edits to independent files in parallel where possible.

### Phase 4: Verify

Run `cargo test --all` and `cargo clippy --all`. The help system tests catch
mismatches between schemas and categorization.

## Documents That Must Stay in Sync

| Document | Section | What Drifts | Risk |
|----------|---------|-------------|------|
| `README.md` | Builtin table (under `## Builtins`) | Tool names and categories | **HIGH** |
| `README.md` | Quick tour examples | Commands and syntax | **HIGH** |
| `help.rs` | `format_tool_list()` match arms | Category assignments | **HIGH** |
| `docs/help/overview.md` | Topic list | Available help topics | Medium |
| `docs/help/syntax.md` | Syntax reference | Language features | Medium |
| `docs/help/limits.md` | Limitations table | Builtin constraints | Medium |
| `docs/help/scatter.md` | Parameter docs | scatter/gather API | Medium |
| `docs/help/vfs.md` | Mount points | VFS configuration | Medium |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Crate structure | Workspace crates | Medium |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Language key points | Syntax features | Medium |
| `docs/LANGUAGE.md` | Everything | Language reference | Medium |

For detailed mappings, consult `references/sync-map.md`.

## Checklist: Adding a New Builtin

When a new builtin is added, update all of these:

1. `crates/kaish-kernel/src/tools/builtin/mod.rs` — register it
2. `crates/kaish-kernel/src/help.rs` — add to correct category match arm
3. `README.md` — add to builtin table in appropriate category
4. `crates/kaish-kernel/docs/help/limits.md` — if it has known limitations
5. `docs/LANGUAGE.md` — if it introduces new syntax or concepts
6. `CLAUDE.md` — if it changes the language key points or architecture

## Tool Schema Quality

Schemas are agent-facing too — they appear in `help <tool>` and MCP tool
listings. Same token density principle applies.

While reviewing, check tool schemas in `builtin/*.rs`:
- `description` — clear one-liner, no "This tool..." preamble
- `examples` — one strong example showing the most common use case
- Parameter descriptions — precise about types, defaults, valid values
- These drive both `help <tool>` output and MCP tool descriptions
