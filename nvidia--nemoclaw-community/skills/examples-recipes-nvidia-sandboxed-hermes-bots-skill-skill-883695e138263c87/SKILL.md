# Hermes bots in NemoClaw sandboxes

You are operating the `nemoclaw-hermes-swarm` example. It runs several Hermes
bots on one machine, each in its own OpenShell (NemoClaw) sandbox, with NeMo
Relay tracing into an OpenTelemetry collector. Everything goes through one
command, `./swarm`, in the example's root directory.

The machine needs Docker, `openshell`, `nemoclaw`, and Hermes 0.21+. It can be
a Linux host the user reaches over SSH, or the user's own Mac (Colima) or Linux
box, where the bots appear in Desktop under "This device". An OpenAI-compatible
inference endpoint must already exist; deploying a model is out of scope.

## Two habits first

- **Never `openshell policy set`.** It replaces a sandbox's whole policy and
  silently drops its inference and teammate rules. Only ever add, and only
  through `./swarm` (which uses `nemoclaw <sandbox> policy-add`).
- **Login shell for every remote command.** `openshell`, `nemoclaw`, and
  `hermes` live in `~/.local/bin`, which non-login shells do not put on PATH.
  `ssh host 'openshell ...'` fails with `command not found`. Use
  `ssh host 'bash -lc "cd ~/nemoclaw-hermes-swarm && ./swarm status"'`.

## From nothing to a working swarm

```bash
cp swarm.env.example swarm.env      # INFERENCE_BASE_URL, INFERENCE_MODEL
umask 077; printf '%s' '<key>' > ~/.secrets/inference.key
./swarm up
```

`swarm up` runs preflight, builds the image with Hermes baked in, starts the
collector, creates every bot in `BOTS`, restores bots recorded by earlier
`swarm add` commands, wires the mesh, and prints a status table. First run is 8
to 12 minutes, dominated by the image build and two sandbox creations.
Re-running is idempotent and is also how you recover after a reboot: existing
bots are restored, missing configured bots are created.

Then have the user restart Hermes Desktop; the roster is read at launch. For a
remote host they first add it under Settings, Connections, Add connection, SSH.
For their own machine there is nothing to add.

## One bot at a time

```bash
./swarm add nemoclaw-analyst --soul souls/nemoclaw-researcher.md   # meshed to all others
./swarm add nemoclaw-analyst --soul ./my-role.md
./swarm rm nemoclaw-analyst --yes                 # sandbox, profile, key, peers
./swarm ls
./swarm status                                    # health ladder per bot
./swarm test                                      # configuration-aware live suite
./swarm traces nemoclaw-analyst                   # relay state + collector counters
```

`add` takes 3 to 4 minutes, so give the terminal tool a timeout of at least
600 seconds. New bots share the inference endpoint; there is no model load. If
a tool call still times out mid-`add`, do not conclude failure: run
`./swarm ls` and `./swarm status` and read the result. `add` refuses a name that
is already tracked; use `./swarm up` to restore or reconcile it, or remove it
explicitly before changing its role.

`./swarm` fixes its own environment (real `HOME` from the passwd database,
`HERMES_HOME`/`HERMES_PROFILE` cleared, `~/.local/bin` on `PATH`), so it works
from an agent's terminal tool, where `HOME` is rewritten to the profile's
private directory. Do not wrap it in `hermes -p`. If a bot creation ever stops
right after `api port NNNN` with exit 1 and no error, that is the symptom of an
older copy without this fix: the key file was looked up under the wrong home.

## Writing a role (SOUL)

The soul file is the bot's system prompt and matters more than any config.
Give it a method rather than an identity. Two paragraphs that fixed observed
failures:

```markdown
Deliver a usable answer in THE SAME MESSAGE. Never ask the user to scope the
task and never promise to report back later. Nothing re-prompts you.

If a source is unreachable, report what you have and name the blocker in one
line. Three failed attempts with the same tool means the path is closed.
```

Never let a bot claim a fact a tool did not return this session. Without a
reachable source, models produce plausible issue numbers and versions from
training data.

`swarm add` appends a short Runtime section (you are a NemoClaw bot in sandbox
X, here is what you can reach) and a Teammates section to whatever soul you
give it.

Name bots `nemoclaw-<role>`. The name is the @handle in Desktop, the host
profile, and the sandbox, so the roster reads as a fleet of NemoClaw bots.

To give one bot more network reach than the others, add
`policies/<bot>.yaml` (a preset; see `policies/nemoclaw-researcher.yaml`).
`swarm add` applies it automatically when the file exists. Bots without a file
get only the model endpoint, the collector, and their teammates.

For a local video that an owned, Ready `nemoclaw-vss` bot should analyze, the
host operator must add it explicitly:

```bash
./swarm video-add /absolute/path/to/clip.mp4
```

Use the sanitized filename the command prints in chat. Chat text and Desktop
attachments never select or copy host files. The VSS tools accept only a file
already under `/sandbox/videos`, never a URL or host path. The operator command
accepts one nonempty, regular, non-symlink `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.mov`, `.mkv`, or
`.avi` no larger than 40 MiB.

## Diagnosing "a bot is down"

In this order. Stop at the first failure.

1. **Is the Desktop app running on the user's machine?**
   `pgrep -f "Hermes.app/Contents/MacOS/Hermes"`. Several bots erroring at once
   with no error text is nearly always the client having exited. Relaunch.
2. **Does the bot answer directly?** `hermes -p <bot> chat -q "Reply with OK"`
   on the host. A reply means the bot is fine and the fault is Desktop-side.
3. **Is the model endpoint up?** `./swarm doctor` checks auth and that the model
   is listed. Since 0.21 a dead endpoint surfaces in Desktop as
   `[reason: model_unavailable]` rather than a generic error.
4. **`./swarm status`.** Each rung is a real probe: sandbox phase, api_server
   200, a chat turn through the sandbox, relay active, host profile running.
5. **Restart the Desktop app.** Every in-sandbox gateway restart invalidates
   the Desktop's backend, so `swarm up` after a reboot means the user restarts
   the app too. Never restart gateways right before a demonstration.

## Failures that look like something else

- **Bot works over HTTP but is missing from the roster.** Two gateways per bot:
  one inside the sandbox (serves the api_server), one on the host (`hermes -p
  <bot> gateway run`) that makes the profile report `running`. The roster
  lists only the second. `swarm up` starts both; `swarm status` checks both.
- **`403` vs `502` vs `000` from inside a sandbox.** 403: policy denied it
  (host not allowed, *or the calling binary is not listed*; policies bind to
  both). 502: allowed, but nothing listening, usually a service on host
  loopback. 000 with `CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403` in stderr: HTTPS to
  an unlisted host, also a denial. `127.0.0.1` inside a sandbox is the sandbox;
  cross to the host with `host.openshell.internal`.
- **`policy-add` says `Preset must declare preset.name`.** Files given to
  policy-add are presets: top-level `preset: {name, description}`, no
  `version:`. `policies/otlp-export.yaml` is the reference shape.
- **`message_teammate` says "No API key available … HERMES_PEER_NEMOCLAW-X_KEY".**
  An old copy of the teammates plugin; Hermes turns dashes into underscores in
  that variable name and the plugin now does too. `swarm up` reinstalls it.
- **Relay "not active" but spans arrive.** The activation line is logged at
  INFO to `/sandbox/.hermes/logs/agent.log` inside the sandbox, not
  `gateway.log` and not the stderr captured on the host. Trust the collector
  counters (`./swarm traces <bot>`); they are the only delivery signal.
- **A repeated identical prompt returns instantly and no new session appears.**
  The api_server dedupes identical requests through its response store. Use a
  unique token when probing.
- **`swarm rm` printed nothing.** It asked for confirmation on a stdin that was
  closed. Pass `--yes` when scripting.
- **Removed bots reappear as `stopped` profiles a minute later.** The Desktop's
  host backend (`hermes serve --isolated`) cached the profile list at start and
  its cron ticker recreates `<profile>/cron/` every 60 s. Kill that process,
  remove its `~/.hermes/desktop-ssh/<hash>/`, delete the ghosts, and have the
  user restart Desktop.
- **A bot replies `(pass)`.** Correct. The room prompt says reply only with
  something new.
- **A chained task stalls.** `@b research, @c summarise, @a brief` deadlocks
  when `@b` never got the message. Check whether the *first* bot in the chain
  received anything.

## Traps in your own diagnostics

- **`gateway.pid` holds JSON**, not a bare PID. Ask `hermes profile list`.
- **Nested shell quoting mangles keys** and yields 401s from healthy endpoints.
  Read keys from files inside a script; never interpolate them through
  `ssh '… "… \"…\" …" …'`. Same for `python -c` through `sandbox exec`: two
  shells eat the quotes. Use a heredoc on stdin.
- **`pkill -f <pattern>` over SSH can match your own session** and kill it.
  Patterns that include the sandbox name (`sandbox exec -n nemoclaw-x`) match the
  ssh command that contains them. Kill by PID or by a pattern the outer
  command cannot contain (`--timeout 0`).
- **`docker ps` showing `Up` proves nothing.** Probe the port.

## Before claiming success

Run `./swarm test` and quote its `SUMMARY: N passed, 0 failed` line along with
the enabled sections. The total varies with the tracked bots and optional
services. If something failed, name the check and the error rather than
reporting a clean run. Do not trust a bot's self-description; it can recite its
role while every tool is broken.

For a public change, `./swarm presubmit` gates secrets, internal hostnames,
SPDX headers, and shell syntax.
