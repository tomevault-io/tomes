# Wireframe Skill

Write a wiremd `.md` file, render it, and iterate. wiremd converts plain Markdown with extended
syntax into visual wireframes — 7 styles, no design tools needed.

## Workflows

### 1. Create from a description or spec
1. Understand the screen's purpose — what does the user accomplish here?
2. Sketch structure top-to-bottom: nav → layout → content sections → forms/data → off-screen elements (modals)
3. Write the wiremd file using the quick reference below
4. Render and tell the user where to open it

### 2. Document an existing component or screen
1. Read the JSX/TSX component tree — focus on structure, not logic
2. Map components to wiremd equivalents (see `references/syntax.md` → Component mapping table)
3. Write top-to-bottom following visual flow
4. **Capture:** layout, navigation, form fields/labels, button labels, table columns, states
5. **Skip:** exact colors, event handlers, API calls, business logic

## Before you render

Answer three questions up front — they determine what you build and how you hand it back.

**1. What wiremd version is available?** Run `wiremd --version`. Require **≥ 0.1.7** for:

- `::: layout {.sidebar-main}` — proper sidebar CSS (stock 0.1.5 stacks vertically)
- `[[ [Label](./page.md) | ... ]]` — cross-page hrefs in nav (stock 0.1.5 drops them silently)
- `![[file.md]]` — shared partial includes

If older, build from source: `git clone https://github.com/teezeit/wiremd && cd wiremd && npm install && npm run build`, then invoke via `node path/to/wiremd-fork/bin/wiremd.js`.

**2. Single page or multi-page?** Ask the user up front. For multi-page, scaffold from the start — don't bolt on later:

- `_nav.md` shared across all pages via `![[_nav.md]]`
- `_sidebar.md` if using sidebar layout
- one `.md` per page at top level

See `references/multi-page.md` for folder layout, cross-page link syntax, and the rebuild recipe.

**3. Which render route does this environment support?** Triage by the tools Claude actually has — not by product name. See `references/rendering-modes.md` for the full table.

- **Write files + run shell** (Claude Code, VS Code+terminal, Cowork/Desktop with filesystem + code-execution tools) → **files in folder** is the default. Render `.html` into the user's folder; they open via `file://` or double-click.
- **User is on their own local terminal** → `--serve PORT --watch` for live iteration.
- **Chat only (no filesystem, no exec)** → hand off the `.md` and direct the user to `https://tobiashoelzer.com/wiremd/editor` to paste and render.
- **Never hand out a sandbox `localhost:PORT` URL** — it binds to Claude's host, not the user's. When in doubt, write HTML to the folder.

---

## Rendering

```bash
# Live preview in browser with hot reload
wiremd my-screen.md --style clean --serve 3001 --watch

# Build to a static HTML file
wiremd my-screen.md -o output.html -s clean

# VS Code: Cmd+Shift+P → "wiremd: Open Preview" (live preview while editing)
# See references/vscode.md for extension install steps
```

Tell the user: open `http://localhost:3001` for live preview, or the HTML path for a static file.

To screenshot and verify from the CLI:
```bash
npx playwright screenshot --browser chromium --full-page "file://$(pwd)/output.html" /tmp/wf-check.png
```
Then read the PNG with the Read tool.

## Style picker

Default to `clean` unless the user specifies otherwise. See `references/styles.md` for full descriptions.

| Style | Best for |
|-------|----------|
| `sketch` | Early ideation, lo-fi client presentations |
| `clean` | Stakeholder review, internal handoff (default) |
| `wireframe` | Low-fidelity explorations, documentation |
| `material` | Material Design apps |
| `tailwind` | Tailwind-based products, indigo/purple palette |
| `brutal` | Bold, high-contrast concepts |
| `none` | Custom CSS, embedding elsewhere |

## Gotchas

1. **Label directly above input.** No blank line between label text and `[_____]` — it breaks the association.
2. **Blank line before `:::` when last line has inline elements.** Buttons, backtick code, bold, links, or list items on the final line of a container — add an empty line before `:::`.
3. **`[[ ]]` nav hrefs require wiremd ≥ 0.1.7.** Earlier versions silently drop the URL and every item renders as `href="#"`. Mixed static + clickable works in 0.1.7+: `[[ *Home* | [About](./about.md) | [Contact](./contact.md) ]]`.
4. **`:::accordion` doesn't exist.** Use `::: tabs` with `::: tab Label` children for tabbed panels. For a simple button-group switcher, use `[Tab]*  [Other]`.
5. **Use `![[file.md]]` for includes, not `:::display`.** `:::display` is obsolete. `![[path/to/file.md]]` works in both the CLI and VS Code preview — path resolves relative to the current file.
6. **Sandbox `--serve` is unreachable from the user's browser.** `wiremd --serve PORT` binds to `localhost` on Claude's host, not the user's. When Claude is running in Cowork/Desktop and the user is elsewhere, write HTML to a shared folder instead. See `references/rendering-modes.md`.
7. **Static HTML keeps `.md` hrefs — rewrite after build.** `wiremd x.md -o x.html` preserves `./page.md` link targets. For `file://` double-click delivery, rewrite with: `sed -i -E 's|href="\./([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)\.md"|href="./\1.html"|g' *.html`. On macOS without GNU sed, use `sed -i ''`.
