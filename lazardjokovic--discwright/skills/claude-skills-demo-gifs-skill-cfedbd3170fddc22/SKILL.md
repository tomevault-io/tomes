# Recording the demo GIFs

The GIFs in `docs/` are the first thing anyone sees of DiscWright, and until now they were
cut by hand from a screen recording, which is why they went stale. This drives the real
window the way `tests/ui` does, photographs it, and assembles the frames.

Two recordings come out of one run:

| file | what it shows |
|---|---|
| `docs/demo.gif` | one game, start to a finished ISO, ending on the build |
| `docs/multi-game.gif` | two games with add-ons, artwork and music, ending on the menu chooser |

`docs/disc.gif` is not made here. It shows Explorer with a disc mounted, not the app.

## Before running

**The only thing a person has to do is stay off the machine.** Everything else the
recorder now handles itself. Say so plainly before starting, and say when the machine is
theirs again: this drives the real pointer and the real foreground window, and it stops the
moment anything else takes the foreground, photographing whatever that was.

A browser left in front is enough to stop it. The window being merely unattended is not the
same as the desktop being free.

Handled without asking:

- **Priming the game picker.** With no memory it opens at GOG Galaxy's download folder,
  and every step count here is measured from the demo folder's own node. `F:\DWdemo-prime`
  holds a built project for this and is found automatically; `-PrimeFrom` overrides it.
  Without one, the run stops and asks for a single pick, which is the only time a person
  was ever needed.
- **An output folder with a previous build in it**, which would make the button read
  REBUILD ISO. Its contents are moved to `F:\DWdemo-previous-runs\<timestamp>`.

Still true, and still worth knowing:

- **The demo folder.** Everything on camera comes from `F:\DWdemo`, whose own
  `RECORDING-STEPS.md` is the human version of this procedure. That path exists so no
  username appears in any of the six text boxes the window keeps on screen. Never record
  with assets under a home directory.
- **Nothing may be added to the demo root.** The folder dialog is navigated by counting
  rows, so a folder left beside the games shifts every count below it. One left there once
  put The Witcher a row lower and the recording picked the wrong game. Anything parked goes
  beside `F:\DWdemo`, never inside it.
- **The two films are a pair.** The second opens the disc the first built, so `-Only multi`
  fails unless `-Only demo` has run first.
- **Pillow** is needed for the assembler.
- **Watch the log, not the screen.** Started in the background with its output in a file,
  a run that is waiting on something can be told apart from one that is simply slow. The
  long stretch is a real 7.79 GB build and looks like nothing happening.

## Running it

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -STA -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .claude\skills\demo-gifs\Record-DemoGifs.ps1
python .claude\skills\demo-gifs\assemble.py "$env:TEMP\discwright-gifs\frames-demo"  docs\demo.gif
python .claude\skills\demo-gifs\assemble.py "$env:TEMP\discwright-gifs\frames-multi" docs\multi-game.gif
```

`-Only demo` or `-Only multi` records one of them. `-DemoRoot` and `-PrimeFrom` move the
fixture. Budget about ten minutes: most of it is a real 7.79 GB build, which is the point of
that GIF.

## What had to be worked out, and must not be lost

**Nobody needs to touch the machine.** The one thing that used to need a person was teaching
the game picker where the demo folder is, since with no memory it opens at GOG Galaxy's
download folder. `-PrimeFrom` solves it: opening any previously built project puts a game on
the form, the picker learns that game's parent, and New disc clears the form while keeping
what it learned.

**Folder dialogs open with the keyboard focus on OK.** Arrow keys sent at a freshly opened
Browse For Folder go to a button and the selection never moves. Tab until the Navigation
Pane reports focus first. This is why `Complete-FolderDialog`'s `-Expand` and `-Down`
arguments in `tests/ui/UiDriver.psm1` have never actually moved anything: every caller so
far just clicked OK on a path the app had already seeded.

**Step counts are measured, not assumed.** `treemap.ps1` walks the tree and reports which
DOWN count reaches which folder. Re-run it after anything is added to or removed from the
demo folder, and update the constants at the top of the recorder.

**Every folder dialog is cut from the finished GIF.** Its tree shows the OneDrive node and a
personal folder, both carrying a real name, and seeding it three levels deep does not scroll
them out of view. The recorder writes the stretches to cut by the clock, the capture writes
a timestamp for every frame, and the assembler drops exactly those frames. The 0.4.0 GIFs
cut the same segment, presumably having hit the same thing.

**The menu preview is invisible to UI Automation.** It is an HTA, so there is no rectangle
and no descendants to find, not even the window. It is moved into the captured region with
MoveWindow and its buttons are clicked by position, found by scanning three columns of the
panel for the flat button colour rather than by recomputing the layout arithmetic the menu
does itself.

**The pointer has to be drawn in.** Screen capture does not include the cursor, and a form
whose fields fill themselves with nothing on screen causing it reads as a slideshow. The
capture composites the real cursor, shape and hotspot included, so the I-beam still shows
over the text boxes. The driver glides the pointer to each control instead of teleporting.

**Dialogs need time to paint.** Typing the instant the dialog exists catches the shell
mid-draw and the recording gets a white rectangle.

**One palette for the whole film.** Give each frame its own and Pillow stores every frame
whole: 19 MB instead of 1.3 MB, because a GIF can only store the rectangle that changed
while the colours stay put. Split it by what the two halves need, 208 entries from the
busiest frame and 48 from the plainest, or the menu artwork bands into contour rings. Do not
dither: error diffusion spreads one changed pixel across everything below it, so a moving
pointer redraws the whole frame and the file goes to 13 MB.

`tools/New-DemoGif.ps1` is an earlier attempt at this from PR #10. Nothing references it and
it never produced the published GIFs.
