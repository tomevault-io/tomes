## How Libretto Works

- Libretto is a CLI for exploring live websites and building or debugging reusable browser automation scripts.
- Use Libretto commands to inspect the site and open pages, observe state, inspect requests, and prototype interactions.
- Libretto work must end in script changes. Create or edit the workflow file instead of stopping at interactive exploration.

## Shipped Source & Documentation

Read `references/shipped-source-and-documentation.md` for shipped source details, published documentation links, and implementation context beyond what this skill file covers.

## Default Integration Approach

1. Call the site's fetch/XHR endpoints via browser-context `fetch()`.
2. If `references/site-security-review.md` (assess only once per site) rules `fetch()` unsafe, passively capture responses with `page.on('response', ...)`
3. Fall back to Playwright UI automation.

Mix strategies freely across steps on a site.

Prefer to enter sites at a user-facing URL (homepage, login, etc.) on the first navigation — deep URLs on a cold session are commonly blocked by edge bot protection.

Always declare that entry URL as workflow `startUrl`. Do not open the same URL again with `page.goto` at the top of the handler when Libretto launches the browser; Libretto loads `startUrl` before the handler runs (and before CDP attach on Kernel / cloud providers). `run --cdp` attaches without navigating, so leave the existing page as-is or navigate inside the handler.

## CAPTCHA Handling

- If a CAPTCHA, Cloudflare challenge, or similar bot check appears in a local Chromium session, try to solve it in the visible browser and continue from the solved state.
- If the same challenge appears while the session is using a hosted browser provider, wait up to 2 minutes for automatic CAPTCHA handling before deciding the workflow is blocked.
- When a CAPTCHA was observed during exploration, generated workflow code should include an explicit timeout wait at that point with a short comment linking to the hosted platform stealth docs. Follow `references/code-generation-rules.md` for the code shape.

## Setup

- Use the package manager convention for the target project. The examples use `npx libretto`; pnpm, yarn, and bun projects should use their equivalent package-manager execution form.
- Use `npx libretto setup` for first-time workspace onboarding. It installs Chromium and syncs skills.
- Use `npx libretto status` to inspect open sessions without triggering setup.
- Use `npx libretto update` to upgrade the project-local Libretto package. Use `npx libretto update --dry-run` to preview the package-manager command first.

## Experiments

- Use `npx libretto experiments` to list internal feature flags and `npx libretto experiments describe <name>` for usage notes when an experiment is enabled.

## Run Modes

There are three ways to run workflows:

- Local browser run: `npx libretto run ./workflow.ts` runs workflow code and local Chromium on the current machine. This is easy to watch and private, but most likely to hit CAPTCHAs or anti-bot checks.
- Hosted browser run: `npx libretto run ./workflow.ts --provider libretto-cloud` runs workflow code locally while the browser runs on provider infrastructure with stealth mechanisms. Use this for anti-bot/CAPTCHA issues, provider-specific behavior, and pre-deploy validation. If the user has not specified a provider, prefer `libretto-cloud` because it includes one free allocated browser-hour and does not require a third-party provider API key.
- Deployed workflow: Libretto Cloud packages the workflow as an API-backed workflow with the same remote-browser anti-bot mechanisms as hosted provider runs. Deploy only after the workflow passes with the target provider.

When editing a deployed workflow, validate changes with `run --provider <deployment-provider>` before redeploying; do not debug by repeatedly deploying and running the deployed job.

If the user prefers a provider for all local CLI runs in a workspace or only deploys workflows to that provider, update `.libretto/config.json` with `provider` instead of repeating `--provider`. Read `references/configuration-file-reference.md` first.

## Working Rules

- Announce which session you are using and what page you are on.
- Ask instead of guessing when it is unclear what to click, type, or submit.
- Do not treat visibility as interactivity. If an element will not act, inspect blockers before retrying.
- Defer repo/code review until you begin generating code, unless the user explicitly asks for it earlier.
- Read and follow guidelines in `references/code-generation-rules.md` before generating or editing production workflow code. Every generated workflow must set `startUrl` to the first page the automation needs.
- For authenticated workflows, manual login is discovery only. After the user logs in, read only the sign-in action logs and identify the required credentials; if credentials are unclear, ask before writing code.
- Add missing blank `LIBRETTO_CLOUD_<secret_name>=` entries without overwriting populated values. If any required credential is blank, stop and ask the user to fill it; until then, do not inspect logged-in pages, read authenticated network bodies, write workflow code, open validation sessions, or continue discovery.
- Authenticated workflows must implement `librettoAuthenticate` with declared credentials before validation. Use a reusable `*_totp_secret` credential for authenticator-app MFA when the portal supports it (not a one-time `otp_code`). For SMS one-time codes, follow `references/website-authentication.md`.
- Read `references/website-authentication.md` when you need `librettoAuthenticate` examples, auth-profile details, or SMS OTP (`claimSmsOtp`).
- Validation requires a successful clean `run` on a fresh, unauthenticated session with confirmation of the actual returned output, not just process success. Use the same headed or headless mode that the workflow run is already using.
- After validation, always show the user: (1) the output/results from the validation run, and (2) the same command so they can re-run it themselves. Include any `--params`, `--provider`, `--headed`, or `--headless` flags the workflow needs. Do not add `--auth-profile` to `run`; workflow `authProfile` metadata controls profile use.
- Treat exploration sessions as disposable unless the user explicitly wants one kept open.
- Close disposable sessions before your final response once exploration, debugging, or validation is complete. Open browsers keep consuming local or hosted resources.
- Get explicit user confirmation before mutating actions or replaying network requests that may have side effects.
- Never run multiple `exec` commands at the same time.
- If the browser must remain read-only, switch to the `libretto-readonly` skill and use `readonly-exec` instead of `exec`.

## Commands

### `open`

- Open a page before using `exec` or `snapshot`.
- Use `open` at the start of script authoring when you need live page state to decide how the workflow should work.
- Use headed mode when the user needs to log in or watch the workflow.
- Pass `--read-only` when you want the session locked for inspection from the moment it is created.

```bash
npx libretto open https://example.com
npx libretto open https://example.com --provider libretto-cloud --session provider-debug
npx libretto open https://example.com --read-only --session readonly-example
npx libretto open https://example.com --session debug-example
```

### `connect`

- Use `connect` to attach to any existing Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) endpoint — a browser started with `--remote-debugging-port`, an Electron app, or any other CDP-compatible target.
- After connecting, `exec`, `snapshot`, `pages`, and the rest of the session commands follow that session's stored mode.
- Libretto does not manage the connected process's lifecycle. `close` clears the session but does not terminate the remote process.
- Pass `--read-only` if the connected session must stay inspection-only from the start.

```bash
npx libretto connect http://127.0.0.1:9222 --session my-session
npx libretto connect http://127.0.0.1:9222 --read-only --session readonly-session
npx libretto connect http://127.0.0.1:9223 --session another-session
```

### `session-mode`

- Use `session-mode` to inspect whether an existing session is `write-access` or `read-only`.
- Only a user can change the session mode for an existing session. Never change a session's mode on your own — the user must change it themselves manually.
- `open`, `run`, and `connect` default new sessions to `write-access` unless the config sets `sessionMode` to `read-only`.
- Pass `--read-only` or `--write-access` to override the config default for a single command.

```bash
npx libretto session-mode --session my-session
```

### `snapshot`

- Use `snapshot` as the primary page observation tool.
- Run `snapshot` without `--objective` or `--context`; the command prints a screenshot path and compact accessibility tree for the current page.
- Run `snapshot <ref>` to inspect a subtree. Each call captures a fresh screenshot and accessibility tree, then scopes output to that ref. Use ref forms printed in the tree, such as `l16`; numeric-suffix aliases such as `e16` also match `l16`.
- Use it before guessing at selectors, after workflow failures, and whenever the visible page state is unclear.

```bash
npx libretto snapshot --session debug-example
npx libretto snapshot <ref> --session debug-example
npx libretto snapshot --session debug-example --page <page-id>
```

### `exec`

- Use `exec` for focused inspection and short-lived interaction experiments.
- Use `exec` to validate selectors, inspect data, or prototype a step before you encode it in the workflow file.
- Use `exec -` to run multi-line scripts from stdin, especially when the code is too long or complex for a command line argument.
- The `exec` REPL is persistent for each browser session. Define helper functions once and reuse them in later `exec` calls.
- Available globals: `page`, `frame`, `context`, `browser`, `fetch`, `Buffer`.
- Let failures throw. Do not hide `exec` failures with `try/catch` or `.catch()`.
- Do not run multiple `exec` commands in parallel.
- Do not use `exec` in read-only diagnosis flows. Use `readonly-exec` from the `libretto-readonly` skill for those sessions.
- Snapshot diffs are opt-in. Pass `--diff-snapshot` when you mutate the page and do not know what will change (for example clicking an unfamiliar control). Prefer returning a specific value or running `snapshot` when you already know what to check.
- Without `--diff-snapshot`, `exec` skips the before/after compact snapshot work.

```bash
npx libretto exec "await page.url()"
npx libretto exec "await page.locator('button:has-text(\"Continue\")').click()"
npx libretto exec --diff-snapshot "await page.locator('button:has-text(\"Continue\")').click()"
echo "async function textOf(selector) { return await page.locator(selector).textContent(); }" | npx libretto exec - --session debug-example
npx libretto exec --session debug-example "await textOf('h1')"
```

### `pages`

- Use `pages` when a popup, new tab, or second page appears.
- If `exec` or `snapshot` complains about multiple pages, list page ids first and then pass `--page`.

```bash
npx libretto pages --session debug-example
npx libretto exec --session debug-example --page <page-id> "await page.url()"
```

### `run`

- Use `run` to verify a workflow file after creating it or editing it. Use the same headed or headless mode for validation that the workflow run is already using. Plain `run` defaults to headed mode.
- Workflows define their input shape with a Zod schema (see `references/code-generation-rules.md`). `run` validates `--params` against that schema before calling the handler and prints a clear field-by-field error if the input doesn't match.
- Successful runs close the browser by default. Pass `--stay-open-on-success` when you need to inspect the completed state with `pages`, `snapshot`, or `exec`.
- Use `--provider <name>` when validating behavior in that provider's browser runtime.
- Use `--cdp <url>` to run a workflow against an existing CDP endpoint (Electron or Chrome with `--remote-debugging-port`). Libretto attaches without navigating to workflow `startUrl`, preserving the page URL and auth state. Do not pass `--provider`, `--headed`, `--headless`, or `--viewport` with `--cdp`. Optional `--page page-N` selects which discovered page becomes `ctx.page`.
- Prefer `connect` + `exec` / `snapshot` for interactive exploration of an external CDP browser; use `run --cdp` once the workflow file is ready.
- Pass `--read-only` if the preserved session should come back locked for follow-up terminal inspection after the workflow run.
- If the workflow fails, Libretto keeps the browser open. Inspect the failed state with `snapshot` and `exec` before editing code.
- Insert `await pause(session)` statements in the workflow file when you need to stop at specific states for interactive debugging, like breakpoints in the browser flow.
- If the workflow pauses, resume it with `npx libretto resume --session <name>`.
- Re-run the same workflow after each fix to verify the browser behavior end to end.

```bash
npx libretto run ./integration.ts --params '{"status":"open"}'
npx libretto run ./integration.ts --provider libretto-cloud
npx libretto run ./integration.ts --cdp http://127.0.0.1:9222
npx libretto run ./integration.ts --cdp http://127.0.0.1:9222 --page page-1
npx libretto run ./integration.ts --read-only
npx libretto run ./integration.ts --stay-open-on-success
```

### `resume`

- Workflows pause by calling `await pause("session-name")` in the workflow file. Import `pause` from `"libretto"`.
- `pause(session)` is a no-op when `NODE_ENV === "production"`.
- Use `resume` when a workflow hit a `pause()` call.
- Keep resuming the same session until the workflow completes or pauses again.

```bash
npx libretto resume --session debug-example
```

### `save`

- Use `save` only when the user explicitly asks to save or reuse authenticated browser state.

```bash
npx libretto save app.example.com
```

### `close`

- Use `close` when the user is done with the session or an exploration session is no longer helping progress (unless the user asked to keep watching that browser).
- Prefer closing sessions promptly after successful validation or diagnosis so unused browsers do not keep consuming resources.
- `close --all` is available for workspace cleanup.

```bash
npx libretto close --session debug-example
npx libretto close --all
```

## Session Logs

Session state is stored in `.libretto/sessions/<session>/state.json`.

Session logs are JSONL files at `.libretto/sessions/<session>/`:

- CLI logs are in `.libretto/sessions/<session>/logs.jsonl`.
- Action logs are in `.libretto/sessions/<session>/actions.jsonl`.
- Network logs are in `.libretto/sessions/<session>/network.jsonl` and their corresponding raw request/response bodies are in `.libretto/sessions/<session>/raw-network/`.

Use `jq` to query jsonl logs directly — for any filtering, slicing, or inspection task.

```bash
# Last 20 action entries
tail -n 20 .libretto/sessions/<session>/actions.jsonl | jq .

# POST requests with captured response previews
jq 'select(.method == "POST" and .responseBodyPreview != null) | {id, resourceType, status, contentType, url, requestBodyPreview, responseBodyPreview, responseBodyPath}' .libretto/sessions/<session>/network.jsonl

# Read a saved response sidecar
gunzip -c .libretto/sessions/<session>/raw-network/000001.response.json.gz | jq .
```

### Action log (`actions.jsonl`)

Key fields: `ts` (ISO timestamp), `source` (`user` or `agent`), `action` (`click`, `fill`, `goto`, etc.), `selector` (locator used by the agent), `bestSemanticSelector` (canonical selector for user DOM events), `success` (boolean), `url` (navigation target), `value` (typed or submitted value), `error` (message on failure).

Read `references/action-logs.md` for full field descriptions and user-vs-agent entry semantics.

### Network log (`network.jsonl`)

Libretto logs useful `document`, `xhr`, `fetch`, and non-noisy mutating requests; obvious static/media/tracking noise is skipped.

Key fields: `id` (incrementing request id), `ts` (ISO timestamp), `pageId` (page target id), `method` (HTTP method, e.g. `GET`, `POST`), `url` (request URL), `resourceType` (browser resource type, e.g. `document`, `xhr`, `fetch`), `status` (HTTP status code, or null for failed requests), `statusText` (HTTP status text), `contentType` (response content type), `requestHeaders` (request headers), `responseHeaders` (response headers), `requestBodyPreview` (inline request body preview), `requestBodyPath` (gzipped full request body sidecar path), `requestBodyBytes` (request body byte size), `requestBodyTruncated` (true when the request body exceeded the save limit), `requestBodyOmittedReason` (why the request body was not captured), `responseBodyPreview` (inline response body preview), `responseBodyPath` (gzipped full response body sidecar path), `responseBodyBytes` (response body byte size), `responseBodyTruncated` (true when the response body exceeded the save limit), `responseBodyOmittedReason` (why the response body was not captured), and `errorText` (request failure or body read error).

## Examples

### Building new browser automation workflows

#### Interactive building

```text
<example>
[Context: The user wants to build a new browser workflow and does not yet know the page structure]
Assistant: I'll inspect the real site first if needed, but before I finish I'll create `target-workflow.ts` so the task produces reusable automation code.
Assistant: [Runs `npx libretto open https://target.example.com --headed`]
Assistant: [If sign-in is required, follows the authenticated workflow rules before continuing]
Assistant: [Reads `references/site-security-review.md` before choosing between passive network inspection, direct browser fetch calls, and Playwright-first automation]
Assistant: [Runs `npx libretto snapshot --session <session>`]
Assistant: [Uses `snapshot` and `exec` as needed to understand the site and decide the implementation path]
Assistant: [Reads `references/code-generation-rules.md` before writing production workflow code]
Assistant: I found the working path. I'll now create the workflow file and verify it.
Assistant: [Creates or edits `target-workflow.ts` following `references/code-generation-rules.md`]
Assistant: [Runs `npx libretto run ./target-workflow.ts --params '{"status":"open"}'` on a fresh, unauthenticated session to verify both sign-in and workflow behavior]
Assistant: [If sign-in validation passes and a reusable session is useful, adds an auth profile and reruns validation]
Assistant: Validation passed. Here are the results:
[Shows the output/results from the validation run]
To run it again, use: npx libretto run ./target-workflow.ts --params '{"status":"open"}'
</example>
```

### Debugging existing workflows

```text
<example>
[Context: The user has an existing Libretto workflow that is failing]
Assistant: I'll reproduce the failure first so we can inspect the exact browser state it leaves behind.
Assistant: [Runs `npx libretto run ./integration.ts --session debug-flow`]
Assistant: The workflow failed and Libretto kept the browser open. I'll inspect the page state before changing code.
Assistant: [Runs `npx libretto snapshot --session debug-flow`]
Assistant: [Runs `npx libretto exec --session debug-flow "...focused inspection or prototype..."`]
Assistant: [Reads `references/code-generation-rules.md` before patching the workflow file]
Assistant: I found the issue. I'll patch the workflow code and verify.
Assistant: [Edits `integration.ts` following `references/code-generation-rules.md`]
Assistant: [Runs `npx libretto run ./integration.ts` to validate the fix]
Assistant: Fix verified. Here are the results:
[Shows the output/results from the validation run]
To run it again, use: npx libretto run ./integration.ts
</example>
```
