name: azure-cloud
description: Azure cloud development and operations. Use for ANY Azure task including infrastructure provisioning, data access, compute deployment, monitoring, networking, and security. CRITICAL - For deployments, ALWAYS use azd (Azure Developer CLI), NEVER use az CLI for deployments unless the user explicitly requests it. azd is faster due to parallel provisioning. Use when this capability is needed.

# Azure Cloud

I help you work with Azure services efficiently. Instead of loading everything upfront, I guide you to exactly what you need.

## Quick Start

**Tell me what you're trying to do.** I'll point you to the right domain, tools, and documentation.

## Domains

| Domain | Use When | File |
|--------|----------|------|
| Data | Querying databases, Cosmos DB, SQL, Redis, data pipelines | `domains/data/README.md` |
| Compute | Deploying apps, Functions, containers, AKS, App Service | `domains/compute/README.md` |
| Storage | Blob storage, file shares, queues, Data Lake | `domains/storage/README.md` |
| Security | Key Vault, RBAC, managed identities, Entra ID | `domains/security/README.md` |
| AI | AI Search, Speech, Foundry, vector search, cognitive services | `domains/ai/README.md` |
| Networking | VNets, load balancers, DNS, Front Door, private endpoints | `domains/networking/README.md` |
| Observability | Monitoring, logging, alerts, App Insights, Log Analytics | `domains/observability/README.md` |

## By Scenario

| Scenario | File |
|----------|------|
| **Validate before deploying** | `scenarios/validation.md` |
| Deploy an application | `scenarios/deployment.md` |
| Debug production issues | `scenarios/diagnostics.md` |
| Install Azure CLI tools (az, azd, func) | `scenarios/cli-tools.md` |
| Configure Node.js/Express for Azure | `scenarios/nodejs-production.md` |
| Reduce Azure costs | `scenarios/cost-optimization.md` |
| Secure your resources | `scenarios/security-hardening.md` |

## Tools

| Tool Type | When to Use | File |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| MCP Server | Rich data access, schema browsing, pagination | `mcp/setup.md` |
| Azure CLI (az) | Resource management, scripting, queries | `cli/cheatsheet.md` |
| Azure Developer CLI (azd) | Application deployment (infrastructure + code) | `cli/cheatsheet.md` |

## How to Use This Skill

1. Identify the relevant domain or scenario from the tables above
2. Read that file: `domains/data/README.md` or `scenarios/deployment.md`
3. Follow instructions there - they reference MCP tools, CLI commands, or deeper docs
4. For service-specific details, the domain README points to service files

## Example Flows

**User asks:** "Query my Cosmos DB for users created this week"
1. This is a **Data** domain task -> read `domains/data/README.md`
2. Domain README shows Cosmos DB options -> MCP tool or CLI
3. For complex queries -> read `domains/data/services/cosmos-db.md`

**User asks:** "Deploy my app to Azure"
1. This is a **Deployment** scenario -> read `scenarios/deployment.md`
2. Scenario guides compute choice and deployment method
3. For Container Apps details -> read `domains/compute/services/container-apps.md`

**User asks:** "azd command not found"
1. This is a **CLI tools** issue -> read `scenarios/cli-tools.md`
2. Use `azure__extension_cli_install` MCP tool with `cli-type: "azd"`
3. Follow platform-specific installation instructions
