# Spatial World Model (world-model-mcp)

This skill provides step-by-step guidance and operational patterns for interacting with `@putervision/world-model-mcp`.

---

## 1. Role in the PuterVision Triad
- **Perception Layer** (`vision-memory-mcp`): Ingests images, detects bounding boxes, extracts OCR.
- **World Model Layer** (`world-model-mcp`): Maintains persistent 3D/2D coordinates, bounding volumes, topological relations, and object permanence.
- **Action/State Layer** (`state-memory-mcp`): Manages task execution DAGs, decisions, blockers, and milestones.

---

## 2. Core Operational Sequence
1. **Inspect World**: Call `get_spatial_map` with `format: 'summary'` to check total entities and spatial bounding box.
2. **Proximity Lookup**: Call `query_entities` with `near_position` and `max_distance`, or `entity_id` for direct lookup.
3. **Ingest Perception**: When new visual elements are detected, call `ingest_observation`.
4. **Collision Pre-Check**: Call `simulate_movement` before issuing action commands.
5. **Update State**: Call `record_outcome` after actions complete.
