```

Or copy the instructions below directly into your CLAUDE.md:

# Qualcomm AI Hub Models

Repository for ML models optimized for Qualcomm chipsets.

## First Session Setup

Before doing anything else, check if `.claude/settings.local.json` contains Read/Edit/Write entries. If not, resolve the paths by running:

```bash
echo "QAIHM_REPO=$(pwd)" && echo "QAIHM_CACHE=${QAIHM_STORE_ROOT:-$HOME}/.qaihm"
```

Then write `.claude/settings.local.json`, replacing `<repo>` and `<cache>` with the resolved absolute paths.

**Important: absolute paths require a `//` prefix** (double slash). Single `/` is interpreted as relative to the project root, not the filesystem root. For example, `Read(/tmp/claude/**)` looks for `<project>/tmp/claude/`, not `/tmp/claude/`. Always use `Read(//tmp/claude/**)` for absolute paths.

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(python *)",
      "Bash(python3 *)",
      "Bash(pre-commit *)",
      "Bash(pip *)",
      "Bash(pytest *)",
      "Bash(grep *)",
      "Bash(find *)",
      "Bash(ls *)",
      "Bash(cat *)",
      "Bash(head *)",
      "Bash(tail *)",
      "Bash(wc *)",
      "Bash(sed *)",
      "Bash(cp *)",
      "Bash(mv *)",
      "Bash(mkdir *)",
      "Bash(rm *)",
      "Bash(echo *)",
      "Bash(git *)",
      "Bash(gh *)",
      "Bash(sleep *)",
      "Bash(which *)",
      "Bash(env *)",
      "Bash(export *)",
      "Bash(cd *)",
      "Bash(pwd *)",
      "Bash(diff *)",
      "Bash(sort *)",
      "Bash(uniq *)",
      "Bash(tr *)",
      "Bash(cut *)",
      "Bash(awk *)",
      "Bash(xargs *)",
      "Bash(touch *)",
      "Bash(realpath *)",
      "Bash(dirname *)",
      "Bash(basename *)",
      "WebFetch(*)",
      "Read(//<repo>/**)",
      "Edit(//<repo>/**)",
      "Read(//<cache>/**)",
      "Edit(//<cache>/**)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Before writing this file, always explain to the user exactly what you are granting.** Example:

> I'd like to configure permissions for this project by writing `.claude/settings.local.json`. This will pre-approve:
>
> - **Shell commands**: python, pre-commit, pip, pytest, git, and common file utilities (grep, find, ls, cp, mv, rm, mkdir, sed, etc.)
> - **Web fetches**: any URL (for downloading model weights, documentation, etc.)
> - **File read/edit/write**: only within this repo (`<repo>`) and the QAIHM cache (`<cache>`)
>
> Note: `/tmp/claude/` permissions are in the shared `settings.json`, not the local settings.
>
> Shall I proceed?

Wait for explicit confirmation before writing. After writing, confirm what was done.

Also ensure the temp directory exists by running `mkdir -p /tmp/claude` (this may prompt once since `/tmp/claude` doesn't exist yet).

### Disable VS Code auto-connect

If the user is running Claude Code from a regular terminal, disable the IDE auto-connect to prevent VS Code from intercepting file edits:

```bash
python3 -c "import json; f=open('$HOME/.claude.json'); d=json.load(f); f.close(); d['autoConnectIde']=False; f=open('$HOME/.claude.json','w'); json.dump(d,f,indent=2); f.close()"
```

This sets `autoConnectIde` to `false` in `~/.claude.json`. Without this, Claude Code will auto-connect to any running VS Code instance and open diff views for every file edit, even when run from a standalone terminal.

## Constraints

**ALL IMPORTS AT THE TOP OF THE FILE.** This is the single most frequently violated rule
in this project. Every `import` statement goes at the top of the file, before any function
or class definition. No exceptions except circular import avoidance. "It's only used in
one function" is not a reason to put it inside the function. "It's a heavy import" is not
a reason. Put it at the top. Every time. Check your code before submitting.

Throughout the session, stay within the boundaries defined by the permissions above:

- **File operations**: Only read/edit/write within this repo, `/tmp/claude/`, and the QAIHM cache. Never write to other locations without asking the user.
- **Shell commands**: Stick to the approved set (python, pre-commit, pip, pytest, git, gh, and standard file utilities). For anything else, ask first.
- **Temporary files**: Always use `/tmp/claude/` — never `/tmp/` directly.
- **Inline Python**: **NEVER use `python3 -c "..."` with multi-line or quote-heavy code** — it confuses the Bash permission matcher and triggers repeated permission prompts. Instead, write the script to a file in `/tmp/claude/` and run it.
  - **Bad**: `python3 -c "import os\nprint(os.environ['FOO'])"` — permission matcher chokes on quotes
  - **Good**: Write to `/tmp/claude/check_env.py`, then run `python3 /tmp/claude/check_env.py`
- **No command chaining**: Never use `&&`, `||`, `;`, or pipes (`|`) in bash commands. The permission matcher splits on these operators and rechecks each side, so a permitted command (e.g. `git status`) gets rejected when piped into something whose argument shape isn't allow-listed. Run each command as a separate Bash call. Redirects (`>`, `>>`) are fine — they don't trigger command splitting.
  - **Bad**: `gh api ... | python3 -c "..."` — pipe confuses permission check
  - **Bad**: `cmd1 && cmd2` / `cmd1; cmd2` — same problem
  - **Good**: `git show HEAD:file.py > /tmp/claude/file.py` — redirects are OK
  - **Good**: `gh api ... --jq '<filter>'` — use tool's own flags instead of piping
  - **Good**: for sequences that genuinely need pipelining, write the whole pipeline to `/tmp/claude/<name>.sh` and run it with `bash /tmp/claude/<name>.sh`
- **No filesystem-wide searches**: Never run `find`, `bfs`, `grep -r`, `rg`, or similar tools against the top level of `/`, `/afs`, or `/mnt/share`. These traverse every mountpoint or every cell of a shared filesystem, generating heavy load on file servers and possibly getting terminated by infrastructure admins. Subdirectories (e.g. `/afs/<specific-cell>`, `/mnt/share/<project>`) are fine.
  - **Bad**: `find / -name qdc_api.py` — scans every mount under root
  - **Bad**: `grep -r foo /afs` — walks every AFS cell
  - **Good**: search a known subtree — `find . -name qdc_api.py` (the repo) or `find /afs/<specific-cell> -name ...`
  - **Good**: locate an installed Python package via the interpreter — write `import pkg, os; print(os.path.dirname(pkg.__file__))` to `/tmp/claude/find_pkg.py`, then run `python3 /tmp/claude/find_pkg.py` (the inline-Python rule above forbids `python3 -c` with quote-heavy code)
  - **Good**: locate venv contents via the venv path — `ls "${VENV:?}/lib/python*/site-packages/<pkg>/"` (the `:?` modifier errors immediately if `$VENV` is unset, preventing a silent fallback to a wide scan)

## Getting Started

After permissions are configured, ask the user what they're working on and load the appropriate resource:

- **Adding a new model** → read `.claude/agents/onboarding.md`
- **Running a HuggingFace model on device** (export, compile, profile on Snapdragon) → read `.claude/docs/hf_onboarding/guide.md`
- **Testing, CI, environment config** → read `.claude/docs/repo-reference.md`
- **Something else** → explore the repo structure and existing models as needed

## Key Commands

- `pre-commit run --all-files` — lint/format check
- `python qai_hub_models/scripts/run_codegen.py -m <model_id>` — generate export.py, README, etc.
- `python -m pytest qai_hub_models/models/<model_id>/test.py -v` — run model tests
- `python -m qai_hub_models.models.<model_id>.export` — export + profile on device

## Resources

- **Model onboarding agent**: `.claude/agents/onboarding.md` — the main workflow
- **Repo reference**: `.claude/docs/repo-reference.md` — testing, CI, env vars, conventions

Onboarding sub-guides (loaded only when needed):
- `.claude/docs/onboarding/datasets-and-evaluators.md` — writing new datasets and evaluators
- `.claude/docs/onboarding/quantization.md` — adding quantized precision support
- `.claude/docs/onboarding/source-as-root.md` — loading model code from GitHub repos
- `.claude/docs/on-device-debugging.md` — rank errors, memory failures, resolution search
- `.claude/docs/collection-models.md` — splitting iterative/recurrent models

Other guides:
- `.claude/docs/hf_onboarding/guide.md` — exporting HF models to ONNX and profiling on Snapdragon via AI Hub
- `.claude/docs/github-ci-guide.md` — using `gh` CLI to fetch PR comments, check CI status, and read test failure logs
- `.claude/docs/filing-issues.md` — filing and querying issues in `qcom-ai-hub/tetracode`

## Qualcomm AI Hub SDK (`qai_hub`)

The `qai_hub` Python package is the SDK for compiling, profiling, and running inference on Qualcomm devices via AI Hub. To explore the API, read the local source — it is the authoritative reference and always matches the installed version.

Find the installed package location with:

```bash
python3 -c "import qai_hub, os; print(os.path.dirname(qai_hub.__file__))"
```

Key files inside that directory:
- **`hub.py`** — top-level API surface (~50 lines). Lists every public function: `get_job`, `get_model`, `submit_compile_job`, `submit_profile_job`, `upload_model`, etc.
- **`client.py`** — full API implementation (~5,500 lines). Contains all classes, methods, and docstrings: `Model`, `Device`, `CompileJob`, `ProfileJob`, `InferenceJob`, `QuantizeJob`, `LinkJob`, `Job`, `Client`, etc.

To look up any API, grep the local source:

```bash
grep -n "def submit_compile_job" <qai_hub_dir>/client.py
grep -n "class ProfileJob" <qai_hub_dir>/client.py
```

Prefer reading the local source over fetching web docs. The web docs at `https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com/docs/` can be used as a fallback if the local source is insufficient.
