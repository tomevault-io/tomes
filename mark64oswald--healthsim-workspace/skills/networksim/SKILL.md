# NetworkSim - Provider Network Intelligence & Analytics

## Overview

NetworkSim queries **real NPPES provider data** (8.9M records), CMS facility data (60K+ facilities), and quality metrics. Unlike synthetic generation, it uses **actual registered providers** to enable:

1. **Provider Discovery**: Search by specialty, location, credentials, quality
2. **Network Analysis**: Assess adequacy against CMS MA, NCQA, Medicaid standards
3. **Healthcare Access**: Identify deserts via access gaps, health needs, vulnerability
4. **Cross-Product Integration**: Provide real providers for PatientSim, MemberSim, TrialSim

## Cross-Product Integration

### NetworkSim → PatientSim

Assign providers to clinical encounters:

```sql
-- Find cardiologist for heart failure patient
SELECT npi, first_name, last_name, credential
FROM network.providers
WHERE taxonomy_1 LIKE '207RC%'  -- Cardiovascular
  AND practice_state = 'TX'
  AND county_fips = '48201'     -- Harris County
LIMIT 1;
```

### NetworkSim → MemberSim

Determine network status for claims:

```sql
-- Check if provider is in network
SELECT 
  CASE WHEN p.npi IS NOT NULL THEN 'IN_NETWORK' 
       ELSE 'OUT_OF_NETWORK' END as network_status
FROM network.providers p
WHERE p.npi = '1234567890';
```

### NetworkSim + PopulationSim

Equity analysis combining provider access with vulnerability:

```sql
-- Provider access in vulnerable communities
SELECT 
    sv.county,
    sv.rpl_themes as svi_percentile,
    COUNT(DISTINCT p.npi) as provider_count,
    sv.e_totpop as population,
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT p.npi) * 100000.0 / sv.e_totpop, 1) as per_100k
FROM population.svi_county sv
LEFT JOIN network.providers p ON sv.stcnty = p.county_fips
WHERE sv.rpl_themes > 0.75  -- Most vulnerable quartile
GROUP BY sv.county, sv.rpl_themes, sv.e_totpop
ORDER BY per_100k ASC;
```

## Safety Guardrails

### Real Data Disclaimer
NetworkSim queries **real NPPES registry data** (public CMS data, non-PHI). Every NPI is a real registered provider. Results reflect registry status only -- not accepting-patients, insurance participation, or clinical competence.

### What NetworkSim Does NOT Do
- **No clinical advice**: Never suggest a provider is "best" for a condition
- **No insurance verification**: Network status is simulated, not real-time eligibility
- **No appointment scheduling**: Registry data is not a booking system
- **No synthetic NPIs in real queries**: Use `synthetic/` skills only for test data

### Code System References
| System | Used For | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| NUCC Taxonomy | Provider specialty classification | `207RC0000X` = Cardiovascular Disease |
| NPI | Provider identification (Luhn-validated) | `1234567890` |
| County FIPS | Geographic scoping | `48201` = Harris County, TX |
| CMS Certification Number | Facility identification | POS file facility IDs |
| CBSA | Urban/rural classification | Metro, micro, rural designations |
| HCPCS | Provider service codes | Level I (CPT) and Level II codes |

**Cross-product code systems** (via PatientSim/MemberSim/RxMemberSim integration): ICD-10 (diagnoses), CPT (procedures), LOINC (labs), SNOMED (clinical terms), RxNorm/NDC (medications). These are real standard codes -- linked patient data is synthetic/fictional.

### Edge Cases
- **Missing county_fips**: ~2.2% of records lack county FIPS; filter with `WHERE county_fips IS NOT NULL` for geographic queries
- **Deactivated NPIs**: Check `npi_deactivation_date IS NULL` for active providers
- **Multi-taxonomy providers**: Up to 15 taxonomies; `taxonomy_1` is primary but check `taxonomy_2`-`taxonomy_4` for dual-specialty searches
- **Organization vs Individual**: `entity_type_code = 1` (individual) vs `2` (organization); filter appropriately

### Negative Examples (What NOT to Do)

**Never give clinical advice based on provider data:**
- WRONG: "I recommend Dr. Smith for your heart condition" or "The patient needs a cardiologist"
- RIGHT: "Here are cardiologists registered in Harris County per NPPES data. This is simulated test data for analytics, not a referral."

**Always distinguish real reference data from synthetic/fictional entities:**
- WRONG: "Here is the patient's real provider" (implies real clinical relationship)
- RIGHT: "NPI data is from the real NPPES registry (public CMS data). Patient/encounter data is synthetic/fictional -- not real patient information."

**Never mix synthetic and real data without labeling:**
- WRONG: Return synthetic NPIs alongside real NPPES query results
- RIGHT: Label synthetic providers (from `synthetic/` skills) vs real providers (from `network.providers`)

## Validation Rules

### NPI: 10 digits, Luhn checksum, prefix 1 (individual) or 2 (organization), active in NPPES
### Taxonomy: Valid NUCC codes, primary taxonomy switch indicator
### Geography: 2-letter state, 5-digit county FIPS, 5- or 9-digit ZIP
