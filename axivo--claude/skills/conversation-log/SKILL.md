# Conversation Log

Technical session documentation with factual accuracy and precision. Captures decisions, outcomes, and next steps for technical work, reviews, architecture discussions, and implementation sessions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Framework observations provide complete document structure and file paths. Always read the conversation log template instructions specified in framework observations before creating conversation logs.

## Skill Methodology

Systematic documentation for technical sessions with factual accuracy and precision. Extends DEVELOPER and ENGINEER profiles with technical writing guidance for session documentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The skill embodies Observe → Capture → Document → Archive
>
> - Process skill instructions systematically
> - Take time to read, understand, and apply each section's logic carefully
> - Rushing past documented procedures causes **fatal** execution errors

### Documentation Principles

- **Factual Accuracy** - Document what actually happened, not idealized versions
- **Technical Precision** - Capture specific decisions, paths, and implementation details
- **Editorial Autonomy** - Write independently without performative language
- **Outcome Focus** - Emphasize completed work and identified next steps
- **Technical Context** - Structure content for technical reference and continuation

### Systematic Approach

Documentation quality improves through consistent application of these principles:

- **DO read template first** - Framework observations specify structure and requirements
- **DO document while working** - Capture technical details as they emerge
- **DO write factually** - Record actual outcomes without editorial enhancement
- **DO NOT defer documentation** - Session details fade quickly from working memory
- **DO NOT idealize outcomes** - Document problems and blocks honestly

## Technical Writing Style

Apply technical writing standards to all conversation log sections.

### Style Guidelines

- **Declarative** - "Implemented authentication middleware" not "We worked on implementing..."
- **Specific** - "`src/auth/middleware.ts` modified" not "authentication code updated"
- **Factual** - "Blocked on API specification" not "unfortunately we couldn't proceed"
- **Concise** - Essential technical details without narrative padding
- **Professional** - Technical precision without casual tone

### Content Guidelines

Include these technical details when documenting sessions:

- Paths for all modified/created resources
- Examples demonstrating key implementations
- Command sequences executed during session
- Specific error messages or issues encountered
- Tool versions or configuration details when relevant
- Architecture decisions with rationale
- Testing approach and validation methods

### Tag Categories

Technical sessions typically use these tag patterns:

- **Domain**: `#infrastructure`, `#systems`, `#software`, `#architecture`, `#operations`
- **Activity**: `#review`, `#debugging`, `#implementation`, `#refactoring`, `#design`
- **Outcome**: `#completed`, `#blocked`, `#research-needed`, `#follow-up-required`

## Common Session Types

Each session type has specific focus areas that guide documentation content. Use these patterns to ensure comprehensive coverage of relevant technical details.

### Architecture Sessions

Focus on:

- Design problem and constraints
- Approaches evaluated with trade-offs
- Recommended solution with justification
- Implementation plan and phases
- Validation criteria and success metrics

### Technical Review Sessions

Focus on:

- Resources reviewed with quality assessment
- Issues identified with severity and location details
- Improvement recommendations with rationale
- Tool findings and metrics
- Action items with priority

### Debugging Sessions

Focus on:

- Problem symptoms and reproduction steps
- Investigation approach and tools used
- Root cause identified (if found)
- Solution implemented or workaround applied
- Prevention strategies for future

### Implementation Sessions

Focus on:

- System or feature implemented
- Architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Resources created/modified with purpose
- Testing approach and validation
- Integration points and dependencies

## Session Guidelines

### Creation Protocol

Before creating a conversation log:

1. **Read Template** - Framework observations specify conversation log template location
2. **Verify Context** - Confirm session date, time, profile, and model context
3. **Assess Status** - Determine accurate status based on work completion
4. **Generate Tags** - Create searchable tags based on session content

### During Documentation

#### DO

- Document actual work performed with specific paths
- Capture technical decisions with rationale
- Include examples that illustrate key points
- Note blocked items with clear dependency identification
- Write honestly about collaboration effectiveness
- Use technical terminology appropriate for the domain

#### DON'T

- Editorialize or add performative enthusiasm
- Document intended work that wasn't completed
- Obscure problems or failures encountered
- Skip technical details to save space
- Add hedging language or excessive politeness
- Create idealized versions of what happened

## Quality Standards

A well-documented session includes:

- Clear technical objective and outcome
- Specific resources modified with paths
- Examples demonstrating key implementations
- Decision rationale for non-obvious choices
- Accurate status reflecting work completion
- Honest collaboration assessment
- Searchable tags for future reference

## Documentation Workflow

1. **Complete Session Work** - Finish technical objectives
2. **Assess Outcomes** - Determine accurate status and next steps
3. **Read Template** - Review conversation log template structure
4. **Write Log** - Create conversation log with systematic documentation
5. **Create Entity** - Register in documentation graph for searchability
6. **Verify Accuracy** - Confirm all technical details are factual and precise

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The conversation log serves as technical reference for session continuation and knowledge retention across the collaboration relationship.
