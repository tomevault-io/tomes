# Code Review

Systematic 9-phase code review methodology using Language Server Protocol tools. Adapts to available LSP capabilities across programming languages.

## Skill Methodology

Systematic 9-phase code review methodology using Language Server Protocol tools. Extends DEVELOPER profile with sequential analysis phases assessing code quality, architecture, and maintainability.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The skill embodies Analyze → Verify → Document → Deliver
>
> - Process skill instructions systematically
> - Take time to read, understand, and apply each section's logic carefully
> - Rushing past documented procedures causes **fatal** execution errors

### Phase Overview

1. **Phase 1 (Project Discovery)** - Establish tool inventory, understand project structure, identify technology stack
2. **Phase 2 (Structural Analysis)** - Analyze code organization, module structure, architectural patterns
3. **Phase 3 (Dependency Mapping)** - Map import relationships, call hierarchies, dependency flow
4. **Phase 4 (Type Safety)** - Assess type coverage, identify type safety issues, verify type inference
5. **Phase 5 (Usage Analysis)** - Analyze how symbols are used throughout the codebase
6. **Phase 6 (Code Quality)** - Evaluate error handling, resource management, code maintainability
7. **Phase 7 (Refactoring Safety)** - Test rename operations, assess refactoring risk before changes
8. **Phase 8 (Consistency)** - Verify naming conventions, style consistency, architectural patterns
9. **Phase 9 (Report)** - Synthesize findings into actionable report with prioritized recommendations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Review phases provide thorough investigation, tool-verified findings, and incremental validation for code quality assessment.

### Systematic Approach

The phases must be completed **sequentially**:

- **DO complete each phase fully** - Each phase delivers specific analysis findings
- **DO wait for approval** - Confirm deliverables before proceeding to next phase
- **DO adapt approach** - Adjust based on available LSP capabilities
- **DO NOT skip phases** - Even if you think you have enough information

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Review quality improves through systematic tool usage and incremental validation.

## Understanding Language Server Capabilities

The initial **Project Discovery** phase establishes which tools are available by calling `get_server_capabilities` tool. This response shows:

- Which LSP capabilities are supported (`supported: true/false`)
- Exact tool names mapped to each capability for this review
- Tool-specific usage metadata and guidelines

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The server capabilities response is the authoritative source for determining which tools to use in subsequent phases.

### Adapting the Review Process

The 9-phase methodology remains consistent across languages. Use the server capabilities response to determine which tools to invoke in each subsequent phase:

1. **Phase 1 (Project Discovery)** - Always available, establishes tool inventory
2. **Phase 2 (Structural Analysis)** - Requires `documentSymbolProvider` capability (universally supported)
3. **Phase 3 (Dependency Mapping)** - Best with `callHierarchyProvider` capability, adapts to definitions/references only
4. **Phase 4 (Type Safety)** - Best with `inlayHintProvider` and `typeDefinitionProvider` capabilities, adapts to hover-only
5. **Phase 5 (Usage Analysis)** - Requires `referencesProvider` capability (widely supported)
6. **Phase 6 (Code Quality)** - Adapts based on `codeActionProvider` and `diagnosticsProvider` capabilities
7. **Phase 7 (Refactoring Safety)** - Best with `renameProvider` capability, adapts to manual assessment
8. **Phase 8 (Consistency)** - Uses basic symbol and formatting tools (widely supported)
9. **Phase 9 (Report)** - Always available, synthesizes findings

### Handling Capability Gaps

When a phase requires capabilities not supported by the language server:

- **DO NOT skip the phase** - Analysis objective remains valid
- **DO adapt your approach** - Use alternative tools or manual analysis
- **DO document limitations** - Note which analyses couldn't be performed
- **DO NOT fail the review** - Work with available capabilities

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Review quality varies based on server capabilities. Document limitations in the final report.

## Session Guidelines

Practical guidance for applying code review methodology consistently throughout review sessions.

### Phase Execution Protocol

The primary protocol for **large codebases** is strictly **one phase per turn** to manage cognitive load, token consumption and maintain collaborative pacing. This protocol must be followed unless an **explicit exception** is granted.

#### Protocol (Always Followed after Each Phase)

1. **Acknowledge completion** with deliverable summary
2. **Wait for user approval** before proceeding
3. **Report only what tools verify** - no speculation

#### Efficiency Exception (Small Scopes)

For analysis scoped to a **subset of the codebase** (e.g., a small PR), analyze the complexity and estimated tool-call cost for the relevant phases. If this analysis determines the token cost is **low** and pacing can be accelerated, **propose combining up to three related phases** into a single turn for efficiency. The user must grant explicit approval before executing the combined phases.

### During Each Phase

Best practices for executing each review phase effectively.

#### DO

- Use all supported LSP tools systematically
- Record exact numbers (don't estimate)
- Note tool failures (explain what didn't work and why)
- Take time for thorough analysis (patience over speed)
- Verify findings with multiple tools when possible
- Check tool metadata from capabilities response for usage guidance

#### DON'T

- Skip phases unless an explicit exception is granted
- Make statements without tool verification
- Assume patterns without checking references
- Rush to conclusions before completing analysis
- Suggest fixes before finishing all phases

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing the review, verify:

- ✅ All 9 phases completed systematically
- ✅ Every claim backed by tool-verified data
- ✅ Exact file:line locations for all issues
- ✅ Critical issues have code examples for fixes
- ✅ Metrics table populated with real numbers
- ✅ Capability limitations documented
- ✅ Refactoring safety assessed
- ✅ Immediate actions clearly defined

## Session Completion

The code review findings serve as actionable reference for improvements and refactoring work.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If user requests a conversation log to document this code review session, the `conversation-log` skill provides developer-specific guidance for technical session documentation.
