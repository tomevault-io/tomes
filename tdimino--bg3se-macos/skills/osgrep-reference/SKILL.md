# osgrep: Semantic Code Search

**ALWAYS prefer osgrep over grep/rg for code exploration.** It finds concepts, not just strings.

## Overview

osgrep is a natural-language semantic code search tool that finds code by concept rather than keyword matching. Unlike `grep` which matches literal strings, osgrep understands code semantics using local AI embeddings.

**Version 0.5.16 (Dec 2025) highlights:**
- `skeleton` command: Compress files to function/class signatures (~85% token reduction)
- `trace` command: Show who calls/what calls for any symbol (call graph)
- `symbols` command: List all indexed symbols with definitions
- `doctor` command: Health/integrity verification
- `list` command: Display all indexed repositories
- Per-project `.osgrep/` directories (no longer global `~/.osgrep/data`)
- V2 architecture with improved performance (~20% token savings, ~30% speedup)
- Go language support
- `--reset` flag for clean re-indexing
- ColBERT reranking for better result relevance
- Role detection: distinguishes orchestration logic from type definitions
- Split searching: separate "Code" and "Docs" indices

**When to use osgrep:**
- Exploring unfamiliar codebases ("where is the auth logic?")
- Finding conceptual patterns ("show me error handling")
- Locating cross-cutting concerns ("all database migrations")
- User explicitly asks to search code semantically

**When to use traditional tools:**
- Searching for exact strings or identifiers (use `Grep`)
- Finding files by name pattern (use `Glob`)
- Already know the exact location (use `Read`)

## Quick Start

**IMPORTANT: You must `cd` into the project directory before running osgrep commands.**
osgrep uses per-project `.osgrep/` indexes, so it only searches the repo you're currently in.

```bash
cd /path/to/project      # REQUIRED: cd into the project first
osgrep "your query"      # Now search works
```

### Basic Search

```bash
osgrep "your semantic query"
osgrep search "your query" path/to/scope    # Scope to subdirectory
osgrep skeleton src/file.py                 # Compress file to signatures
osgrep trace functionName                   # Show call graph
osgrep symbols                              # List all symbols
```

**Examples:**
```bash
osgrep "user registration flow"
osgrep "webhook signature validation"
osgrep "database transaction handling"
osgrep "how are plugins loaded" packages/src
```

### Output Format

Returns results in this format:
```
IMPLEMENTATION path/to/file:line
Score: 0.95

Preamble:
[code snippet or content preview]
...
```

- **IMPLEMENTATION**: Tag indicating the type of match
- **Score**: Relevance score (0-1, higher is better)
- **...**: Truncation marker—snippet is incomplete, use `Read` for full context

## Search Strategy

### For Architectural/System-Level Questions

Use for: auth, integrations, file watching, cross-cutting concerns

1. **Search broadly first** to map the landscape:
   ```bash
   osgrep "authentication authorization checks"
   ```

2. **Survey the results** - look for patterns across multiple files:
   - Are checks in middleware? Decorators? Multiple services?
   - Do file paths suggest different layers (gateway, handlers, utils)?

3. **Read strategically** - pick 2-4 files that represent different aspects:
   - Read the main entry point
   - Read representative middleware/util files
   - Follow imports if architecture is unclear

4. **Refine with specific searches** if one aspect is unclear:
   ```bash
   osgrep "session validation logic"
   osgrep "API authentication middleware"
   ```

### For Targeted Implementation Details

Use for: specific function, algorithm, single feature

1. **Search specifically** about the precise logic:
   ```bash
   osgrep "logic for merging user and default configuration"
   ```

2. **Evaluate the semantic match**:
   - Does the snippet look relevant?
   - If it ends in `...` or cuts off mid-logic, **read the file**

3. **One search, one read**: Use osgrep to pinpoint the best file, then read it fully.

## CLI Reference

### Search Options

**Control result count:**
```bash
osgrep "validation logic" -m 20           # Max 20 results total (default: 10)
osgrep "validation logic" --per-file 3    # Up to 3 matches per file (default: 1)
```

**Output formats:**
```bash
osgrep "API endpoints" --compact           # File paths only
osgrep "API endpoints" --content           # Full chunk content (not just snippets)
osgrep "API endpoints" --scores            # Show relevance scores
osgrep "API endpoints" --plain             # Disable ANSI colors
```

**Sync before search:**
```bash
osgrep "validation logic" -s               # Sync files to index before searching
osgrep "validation logic" -d               # Dry run (show what would sync)
```

### Index Management

```bash
osgrep index                    # Incremental update
osgrep index -r                 # Full re-index from scratch (--reset)
osgrep index -p /path/to/repo   # Index a specific directory
osgrep index -d                 # Preview what would be indexed (--dry-run)
```

### Advanced Commands (v0.5+)

**Skeleton - Compress files to signatures:**
```bash
osgrep skeleton src/server.py              # Show function/class signatures only
osgrep skeleton src/server.py --no-summary # Omit call/complexity summaries
osgrep skeleton "auth logic" -l 5          # Query mode: skeleton of top 5 matching files
```
Output shows: function signatures with `# → calls | C:N | ORCH` summaries inside bodies.

**Trace - Show call graph:**
```bash
osgrep trace handleRequest                 # Who calls this? What does it call?
```

**Symbols - List all indexed symbols:**
```bash
osgrep symbols                             # All symbols (default limit: 20)
osgrep symbols "Request"                   # Filter by pattern
osgrep symbols -p src/api/ -l 50           # Filter by path, increase limit
```

### Other Commands

```bash
osgrep list                     # Show all indexed repositories
osgrep doctor                   # Check health and configuration
osgrep setup                    # Pre-download models (~150MB)
osgrep serve                    # Run background daemon (port 4444)
osgrep serve -p 8080            # Custom port (or OSGREP_PORT=8080)
osgrep serve -b                 # Run in background (--background)
osgrep serve status             # Check if daemon is running
osgrep serve stop               # Stop daemon
osgrep serve stop --all         # Stop all daemons
```

**Serve endpoints:**
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `POST /search` - Search with `{ query, limit, path, rerank }`
- Lock file: `.osgrep/server.json` with `port`/`pid`

### Claude Code Integration

```bash
osgrep install-claude-code      # Install as Claude Code plugin
osgrep install-opencode         # Install for Opencode
```

Both plugins automatically manage the background server lifecycle during sessions.

## Common Search Patterns

### Architecture Exploration

```bash
# Mental processes (Open Souls / Daimonic)
osgrep "mental processes that orchestrate conversation flow"
osgrep "subprocesses that learn about the user"
osgrep "cognitive steps using structured output"

# React/Next.js
osgrep "where do we fetch data in components?"
osgrep "custom hooks for API calls"
osgrep "protected route implementation"

# Backend
osgrep "request validation middleware"
osgrep "authentication flow"
osgrep "rate limiting logic"
```

### Business Logic

```bash
osgrep "payment processing"
osgrep "notification sending"
osgrep "user permission checks"
osgrep "order fulfillment workflow"
```

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

```bash
osgrep "error handling patterns"
osgrep "logging configuration"
osgrep "database migrations"
osgrep "environment variable usage"
```

## Tips for Effective Queries

### Trust the Semantics

You don't need exact names. Conceptual queries work better:

```bash
# Good - conceptual
osgrep "how does the server start"
osgrep "component state management"

# Less effective - too literal
osgrep "server.init"
osgrep "useState"
```

### Be Specific

```bash
# Too vague
osgrep "code"

# Clear intent
osgrep "user registration validation logic"
```

### Use Natural Language

```bash
osgrep "how do we handle payment failures?"
osgrep "what happens when a webhook arrives?"
osgrep "where is user input sanitized?"
```

### Watch for Distributed Patterns

If results span 5+ files in different directories, the feature is likely architectural—survey before diving deep.

### Don't Over-Rely on Snippets

For architectural questions, snippets are signposts, not answers. Read the key files.

## Technical Details

- **100% Local**: Uses transformers.js embeddings (no remote API calls)
- **Auto-Isolated**: Each repo gets its own index in `.osgrep/` directory (v0.5+)
- **Adaptive Performance**: Bounded concurrency keeps system responsive
- **Index Location**: `.osgrep/` in project root (was `~/.osgrep/data/` in v0.4.x)
- **Model Download**: ~150MB on first run (`osgrep setup` to pre-download)
- **Chunking Strategy**: Tree-sitter parses code into function/class boundaries
- **Deduplication**: Identical code blocks are deduplicated
- **Dual Channels**: Separate "Code" and "Docs" indices with ColBERT reranking
- **Structural Boosting**: Functions/classes prioritized over test files
- **Skeleton Compression**: ~85% token reduction when viewing file structure

## Troubleshooting

**"Still Indexing..." message:**
- Index is ongoing. Results will be partial until complete.
- Alert the user and ask if they wish to proceed.

**Slow first search:**
- Expected—indexing takes 30-60s for medium repos
- Use `osgrep setup` to pre-download models

**Index out of date:**
- Run `osgrep index` to refresh
- Run `osgrep index --reset` for a complete re-index
- osgrep usually auto-detects changes

**Installation issues:**

```bash
osgrep doctor              # Diagnose problems
npm install -g osgrep      # Reinstall if needed
```

**No results found:**
- Try broader queries ("authentication" vs "JWT middleware")
- Ensure index is up to date (`osgrep index`)
- Verify you're in the correct repository directory
