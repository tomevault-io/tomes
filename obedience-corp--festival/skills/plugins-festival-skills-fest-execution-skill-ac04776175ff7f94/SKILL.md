# Festival Execution

## Core Loop

```text
fest next → do work → fest task completed|blocked → fest commit → fest validate → repeat
```

## Link + Navigation

Festival commands from a project directory depend on an active festival-project link.

```bash
# In festival directory: link the execution project path
fest link /absolute/path/to/project
fest link --show

# Shell navigation (after `eval "$(fest shell-init zsh)"`)
fgo           # toggle festival ↔ linked project
fgo project   # jump to linked project
fgo fest      # jump back to linked festival
```

If the execution project path changes (moved repo, new worktree), relink before continuing work.

## Task State

```bash
fest task completed
fest task blocked --reason "..."
fest task reset
```

Do not mix command families:
- `fest task` mutates task status.
- `fest workflow` advances phase-level workflow/gate steps.

## Visibility and Dependencies

```bash
fest show --inprogress --watch
fest show --roadmap
fest deps
```

## Workflow Steps (Phase-Level)

```bash
fest workflow status
fest workflow advance
fest workflow skip --reason "..."
```

## Lifecycle Hooks

Task state changes can fire configured hooks. Inspect the effective set before
assuming a transition is inert:

```bash
fest hooks list
```

Verbs: `task_start`, `task_complete`, `sequence_complete`, `phase_complete`,
`gate_approve`.

- `task_start` fires on the **first** transition into work, whichever surface
  causes it: `fest status set in_progress --task <id>`, a direct completion, or
  the first `fest task update <percent>` above zero. Resuming or re-marking in
  progress never re-fires it; `fest task reset` clears the recorded start.
- `task_complete` fires on **every** completion surface, not just
  `fest task completed`.

Task document frontmatter binds names only. Bare `pre`/`post` bind around the
terminal verb; the nested `start:` stage binds around `task_start` and is
honored on task documents only.

```yaml
hooks:
  pre: [lint]
  post: [approval_judge]
  start:
    pre: [anchor]
```

A `fail: closed` pre-hook blocks the transition and leaves the task untouched.

## Validation

```bash
fest validate
fest validate <festival-path>
```

## Common Mistakes

- Using `fest task complete` / `fest task block` (wrong verb forms: use `completed` / `blocked`).
- Confusing `fest workflow` commands with task-status commands.
- Continuing work from a new project path without rerunning `fest link`.
- Skipping `fest next` and manually selecting tasks out of dependency order.
- Putting a `start:` hook stage on a goal document: `task_start` never fires
  there and `fest validate` warns about it.
