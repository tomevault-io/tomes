# Edmund research frontier

Where Edmund could go past the state of the art. Ambition is **product-first**:
"the CotEditor of Markdown editors" (README). Advanced TextKit 2 techniques are
**means, not ends** — a technique is worth pursuing when it makes the product
better, and it becomes publishable as a side effect.

**Everything here is candidate / open. Nothing is proven.** Each item routes its
proof through **edmund-research-methodology** (hypothesis predicts numbers) and
its changes through **edmund-change-control**. Verified 2026-07-05 against the
repo; assets cited are real, outcomes are not.

---

## Frontier 1 — Viewport-stable TextKit 2 at scale (>100k UTF-16)

**Why SOTA fails:** TK2 lays out only near the viewport; off-screen fragment
heights are **estimates** corrected as layout reaches them. This makes the
scroller jump and scroll-to-target miss in **every** TK2 app, including TextEdit
— a widely documented limitation. Above `fullLayoutMaxLength` (100k) Edmund
enters this regime.

**Edmund's asset:** the mitigations already in `TextView/` —
`scheduleFullLayoutSettle`, `preservingViewportAnchor`, `repairContentAboveOrigin`,
`centerViewportOnCaret` re-measure, and the diff-based undo restore that avoids
resetting fragments to estimates; plus the `ScrollStabilityTests` /
`HeightStabilityTests` harnesses. (Note: `repairContentAboveOrigin` is
**mitigated-unconfirmed live** per `docs/investigations/viewport-glitch-investigation.md` — a
real result here would also *retire that honest gap*.)

**First three steps in this repo:**
1. Build a large-doc fixture (`makeLargeMarkdown` in `TestHelpers.swift`) >100k
   and a scripted scroll-accuracy metric (ReproScript `caret` + a `logsel`-style
   position dump, or extend `PerfHarnessTests`).
2. Quantify the estimate-error distribution: for N scroll-to-target operations,
   record predicted vs actual landing pixel offset.
3. Prototype persistent per-fragment height caching across the settle (or across
   sessions) and re-measure the same distribution.

**You have a result when:** scroll-to-target lands within a stated pixel budget
on a 1 MB document, measured by script, with **zero** `repairing content above
origin` events across a scroll soak — reproducibly.

---

## Frontier 2 — Caret integrity by construction

**Why SOTA fails:** every `NSTextView` consumer depends on `didChangeText`
pairing that **AppKit itself violates** (the drag-move bypass). The delete-drift
class is the symptom of building sync on a callback contract AppKit doesn't keep.

**Edmund's asset:** the heal machinery, the `pendingEdit` model, six documented
rounds of mechanism knowledge, and the ReproScript + soak methodology. The
campaign skill runs *individual* rounds reactively; this frontier is the
**structural endgame** — eliminate the class.

**First three steps:**
1. Inventory **every** storage-mutation entry point (grep `replaceCharacters`,
   `setAttributes`, the edit-flow paths) and tabulate which currently rely on a
   callback firing.
2. Design a sync layer keyed on a **storage-version counter** that reconciles
   `rawSource` regardless of which callbacks fired (not a new guard per path).
3. Falsify it against **all** historical `.repro` scripts plus a new randomized
   bypass-fuzzer script.

**You have a result when:** all historical `.repro` scripts and a randomized
bypass soak stay green **with the callback-pairing assumption deleted from the
code**. **Candidate, big** — likely a multi-PR redesign; do not start without the
methodology skill's evidence bar in front of you.

## Frontier 3 — The 10 MB class (performance headroom)

**Why it matters:** README claims "~1–2 MB files"; native-with-no-Electron is the
differentiator, so headroom is a product claim, not vanity.

**Edmund's asset:** viewport-based lazy styling, the idle drain, incremental
reparse (`pendingEdit` window), `PerfHarnessTests`.

**First three steps:**
1. Extend `PerfHarnessTests` with 5/10 MB fixtures (`makeLargeMarkdown`).
2. Profile the block-parse and restyle hot paths (`Log.measure` single-line
   durations are already in place).
3. Set explicit latency budgets for open, first-paint, and per-keystroke restyle
   at 10 MB.

**You have a result when:** open + steady-state typing latency on a 10 MB file
meets a stated budget, measured by the harness (not hand-timed).

---

## Frontier 4 — A native extensions API

**Why SOTA fails:** Obsidian/VS Code plugin ecosystems are Electron; there is no
strong precedent for a **native, safe, fast** extension surface for live-preview
Markdown on macOS. ROADMAP v1.0.0 lists "Extensions API, documentations,
primitive marketplace" and flags Advanced Syntax Highlighting / Advanced Math as
"official extension" candidates.

**Edmund's asset:** the custom-parser seam
(`Parsing/SyntaxHighlighter+CustomParsers.swift`), the `BlockKind`/`styleBlock`
architecture, and already-modular opt-in syntax (math, Obsidian syntax).

**First three steps:**
1. Catalog which existing features could be **re-implemented as extensions**
   (dogfood: callouts? highlight? wikilinks?) — this defines the real extension
   points.
2. Define the minimal seam: block parser? inline parser? theme hook? Draw the
   line at what the custom-parser architecture already supports.
3. Spike **one** official extension behind a flag and measure restyle cost vs the
   built-in.

**You have a result when:** one built-in syntax feature runs as an extension with
**no measurable restyle regression** against the built-in baseline.

---

## Frontier 5 — Accessibility / RTL / localization as a differentiator

**Why it matters:** native apps *can* excel where Electron editors are weak;
ROADMAP v1.x lists Localization, RTL, Accessibility. Locale-aware content width
already ships as precedent that the pipeline can be locale-sensitive.

**Edmund's asset:** the attribute-only pipeline (structure is in the string, not
in inserted characters), the existing locale-aware content-width path.

**First three steps:**
1. VoiceOver audit of `EditorTextView`'s custom drawing — does the accessibility
   tree expose headings/lists/callouts, given they're drawn as decorations?
2. Test RTL behavior of the attribute-only styling on a right-to-left document.
3. Scriptable a11y check (structure read-out) as a regression guard.

**You have a result when:** a scripted VoiceOver audit reads document structure
(headings, list items, callouts) correctly on a mixed document.

## How to start one

1. **Predict numbers first** (edmund-research-methodology §2) — every milestone
   above is a *number*, not a vibe.
2. Instrument to make the current failure/limit cheap to measure.
3. Prototype behind a flag; measure predicted vs observed.
4. Route changes through **edmund-change-control** (branch, tests, no auto-push).
5. When the first milestone lands, the item **graduates to `misc/backlog.md` or
   `docs/ROADMAP.md`** and stops being a frontier.

## What NOT to start (no current asset)

- **iOS / iPadOS port** — explicitly **TBD** in ROADMAP; no shared UI layer today.
- **Collaborative / real-time editing** — zero repo support (no CRDT, no sync,
  single `NSDocument` model). Would be a new product, not a frontier of this one.
- Anything that requires breaking an invariant (storage == rawSource; TextKit 2
  only) to work — that's not a frontier, it's a rewrite (edmund-architecture-contract).

---

## When NOT to use this skill

- Running an *accepted* investigation (a known bug) → **edmund-caret-integrity-campaign** / **edmund-debugging-playbook**.
- The method of turning a hunch into proof → **edmund-research-methodology**.
- Whether a public claim is allowed yet → **edmund-external-positioning**.
- Shipping the change → **edmund-change-control**.

---

## Provenance and maintenance

Verified 2026-07-05. Assets exist; **outcomes are unproven by definition** —
never quote a milestone here as achieved.

```bash
grep -n 'fullLayoutMaxLength' Sources/EdmundCore/TextView/EditorTextView.swift
grep -rn 'repairContentAboveOrigin\|preservingViewportAnchor' Sources/EdmundCore/TextView/
ls Sources/EdmundCore/Parsing/SyntaxHighlighter+CustomParsers.swift
grep -n 'Extensions API\|RTL\|Localization\|iPadOS' docs/ROADMAP.md
grep -rn 'func makeLargeMarkdown' Tests/EdmundTests/TestHelpers.swift
```

When an item's milestone lands, move it to ROADMAP/backlog and delete it here —
a frontier list that keeps solved problems is lying.
