# Apple Context

Use this skill when the user asks about their calendar, schedule, events, availability, travel time, local context, nearby places, weather at their current position, or any request that depends on the device's current location.

## Permissions

- Check `help()`, then `calendar.help()` or `location.help()` before using the modules.
- Calendar and location access states use `granted`, `denied`, and `undefined` through the `state` or `access` fields. If access is `undefined`, calling the relevant request/current function may prompt the user.
- If access is denied, stop using that capability and tell the user to enable access for Herm in iOS Settings or macOS System Settings. Do not repeatedly retry.
- Use only the minimum needed capability. Do not request calendar or location access unless it materially helps with the user's request.

## Calendar

Use `calendar.status()` before reading or changing events when practical. If a calendar operation reports denied access, explain that Calendar access must be enabled in Settings.

```lua
local status = calendar.status()
if status.state == "undefined" then
  status = calendar.request_access("full")
end
```

List events with an explicit time range:

```lua
local events = calendar.events("2026-07-08T00:00:00Z", "2026-07-09T00:00:00Z", {limit = 50})
```

Create events only when the user asked you to add something or clearly approved it:

```lua
local event = calendar.create("Dentist", "2026-07-08T16:00:00Z", "2026-07-08T17:00:00Z", {
  location = "Main St"
})
```

## Location

Use `location.current()` for the current device location. It prompts if access is undefined and returns a table containing `location.latitude`, `location.longitude`, accuracy, and timestamp.

```lua
local here = location.current()
print(here.location.latitude, here.location.longitude)
```

Treat location as sensitive. Do not print precise coordinates unless the user needs them or asks for them; prefer using the location to answer the task.
