---

## Critical: Load Context First

Before performing ANY task in this repository or in projects referencing it:

1. ✅ Check if `ai-dev-standards/` is accessible
2. ✅ Read `meta/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md` (understand the system)
3. ✅ Read `meta/HOW-TO-USE.md` (learn navigation)
4. ✅ Review `meta/DECISION-FRAMEWORK.md` (when making technology choices)
5. ✅ Review `docs/SYSTEM-OVERVIEW.md` (understand the complete architecture)

**Time investment:** 3-5 minutes
**Value:** Prevents mistakes, enables effective use, ensures consistency

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Check Before Creating

**ALWAYS** search for existing solutions before building new:
- Search `meta/skill-registry.json` for relevant skills
- Check `standards/architecture-patterns/` for design approaches
- Review `playbooks/` for operational procedures
- Look in `components/` for reusable implementations
- Consult `examples/` for reference code

**Never invent when a standard exists.**

### 2. Follow Standards Always

**ALL code must follow:**
- Conventions in `standards/coding-conventions/` (when created)
- Best practices in `standards/best-practices/`
- Patterns in `standards/architecture-patterns/`
- Security guidelines (never compromise)

**No exceptions without documented reasoning.**

### 3. Use Skills for Guidance

For specialized tasks:
- Skills activate automatically based on context
- Can explicitly request: "Use the [skill-name] skill to..."
- Skills provide methodology, not rigid rules
- Adapt guidance to specific context

**Let skills augment capabilities.**

### 4. Apply Decision Framework

For ANY architectural or technical decision:
- Consult `meta/DECISION-FRAMEWORK.md`
- List requirements and constraints
- Consider trade-offs
- Document decision with reasoning
- Reference framework sections

**Document decisions, don't just make them.**

### 5. Use Playbooks for Procedures

Check `playbooks/` for step-by-step guides:
- Deployment procedures
- Release management
- Operational tasks
- Common workflows

**Follow playbooks when they exist.**

---

## Task Priority Order

When given any task:

```
1. Load Context
   └─ Read META files (PROJECT-CONTEXT, HOW-TO-USE, DECISION-FRAMEWORK)

2. Check PLAYBOOKS
   └─ Is there an existing procedure for this exact task?

3. Identify SKILLS
   └─ Search meta/skill-registry.json for relevant methodologies

4. Search COMPONENTS
   └─ Can I reuse existing code?

5. Review PATTERNS
   └─ What architectural approach fits?

6. Apply STANDARDS
   └─ What conventions must I follow?

7. Reference EXAMPLES
   └─ Are there similar implementations?

8. Implement
   └─ Build following guidance from above

9. Document
   └─ Record decisions and reference sources
```

---

## File Reference Format

When mentioning files from ai-dev-standards:

**Good examples:**
- "Based on skills/mvp-builder/SKILL.md, the P0/P1/P2 matrix..."
- "Following standards/architecture-patterns/rag-pattern.md:45-67..."
- "As outlined in meta/DECISION-FRAMEWORK.md:123, RAG is appropriate when..."

**Include:**
- Relative path from repository root
- Specific line numbers when referencing details
- Clear connection to current task

---

## Communication Style

### When Starting a Task

**Say:**
```
"I'll [task description]. Let me check our standards repository first...

✓ Loaded meta/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md
✓ Checked playbooks/ for existing procedures
✓ Identified relevant skill: [skill-name]

[Proceed with explanation of approach based on guidance]"
```

### When Making Decisions

**Say:**
```
"Based on meta/DECISION-FRAMEWORK.md ([section-name]), I recommend [choice] because:

Requirements:
- [requirement 1]
- [requirement 2]

Decision: [Choice]

Reasoning:
- [reason 1 citing framework]
- [reason 2 citing framework]

Trade-offs:
- [trade-off 1]
- [trade-off 2]"
```

### When Using Skills

**Say:**
```
"I'm using the [skill-name] skill (skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md) which provides [key methodology].

[Apply skill guidance to specific task]"
```

### When Creating Something New

**Say:**
```
"I didn't find an existing [component/pattern] for this in:
- components/ (checked)
- standards/architecture-patterns/ (checked)
- playbooks/ (checked)

I'll create one following:
- standards/coding-conventions/[relevant].md
- standards/best-practices/[relevant].md

This could be added to ai-dev-standards as [suggestion]."
```

## Quality Gates

Before presenting any code or solution:

- [ ] Follows coding conventions (if standards exist)
- [ ] Includes error handling
- [ ] Has proper logging (where appropriate)
- [ ] Includes tests (for production code)
- [ ] Has documentation
- [ ] Matches patterns from repository
- [ ] Uses available components
- [ ] Security guidelines followed
- [ ] Decisions documented with reasoning

---

## Prohibited Actions

**❌ NEVER:**
- Invent patterns that already exist in standards/
- Skip loading context from META files
- Violate security guidelines in standards/best-practices/
- Ignore decision framework when making choices
- Duplicate existing components
- Create skills/patterns/playbooks that overlap with existing ones
- Compromise on security or quality for speed

---

## Required Actions

**✅ ALWAYS:**
- Load meta/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md every session
- Search for existing solutions before creating new
- Reference specific files and line numbers
- Explain trade-offs when making decisions
- Document reasoning for architectural choices
- Apply security best practices
- Suggest improvements to repository when gaps found

---

## When to Ask User

**ASK when:**
- Multiple valid approaches exist with significant trade-offs
- Business decision needed (not technical)
- Missing critical information for decision
- Security or privacy implications unclear
- Creating something not covered by existing standards

**DON'T ASK when:**
- Standards provide clear guidance
- Pattern exists for this use case
- Decision framework covers the choice
- Playbook documents the procedure
- It's a technical decision with clear best practice

---

## Error Handling

**If ai-dev-standards is not accessible:**
1. Inform user immediately
2. Ask for repository location
3. Proceed with general best practices
4. Note lack of standards explicitly
5. Suggest setting up reference

**If standards conflict with project requirements:**
1. Note the conflict explicitly
2. Explain the standard and why it exists
3. Document the deviation with reasoning
4. Get user approval for deviation
5. Mark deviation clearly in code/docs

---

## Continuous Improvement

**After completing tasks:**
- Identify gaps in standards
- Suggest new skills for common patterns
- Recommend new playbooks for repeated procedures
- Note unclear or outdated guidance
- Propose improvements to decision framework

**Help the repository evolve.**

## Example Workflow

**User:** "Help me build an MVP for a task management app"

**AI Response:**
```
"I'll help build an MVP for a task management app. Let me load context from ai-dev-standards first...

✓ Loaded meta/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md
✓ Loaded meta/HOW-TO-USE.md
✓ Activated mvp-builder skill (skills/mvp-builder/SKILL.md)

Using the mvp-builder methodology:

1. First, let's identify your riskiest assumption using the P0/P1/P2 matrix:
   - P0 (Must have): Core task CRUD, user auth, basic list view
   - P1 (Important but can wait): Due dates, priorities, notifications
   - P2 (Nice to have): Team collaboration, file attachments

2. For MVP pattern, I recommend the Single-Feature MVP approach:
   - Build just task creation/completion/viewing
   - Validate that users actually want another task manager
   - Timeline: 1-2 weeks

3. Tech stack (from meta/DECISION-FRAMEWORK.md, Archetype B):
   - Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
   - Backend: Next.js API Routes
   - Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
   - Hosting: Vercel

Should I proceed with this approach?"
```
