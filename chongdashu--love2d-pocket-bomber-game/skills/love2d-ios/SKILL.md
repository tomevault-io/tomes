# Love2D iOS Development

Build games with Love2D and deploy them to iOS devices—from first prototype to App Store.

## Philosophy: Mobile-First Game Development

Love2D was born on desktop, but mobile is where players are. The challenge isn't just "making it run on iOS"—it's **rethinking the game for touch**.

**Before building for iOS, ask**:
- How will players interact without a keyboard?
- What screen sizes and orientations should be supported?
- Is the game's pacing appropriate for mobile sessions?
- What gestures feel natural for this game's actions?

**Core principles**:

1. **Touch is not a keyboard substitute**: Design touch controls that feel native, not bolted-on. A virtual d-pad is a last resort, not a first choice.

2. **Screen size is a variable, not a constant**: Hard-coded coordinates break on different devices. Think in percentages and relative positions.

3. **The build pipeline is fragile**: Xcode projects, code signing, and bundle resources have many failure points. Understand the system, don't just copy commands.

4. **Iterate on device early**: The simulator lies. Test on real hardware as soon as possible.

## Development Workflow

### Desktop Development First

Develop and test on desktop before touching iOS:

```bash
# macOS: Love2D isn't in PATH by default
/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love /path/to/game

# Or create an alias in ~/.zshrc
alias love="/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love"
```

### Project Structure

```
my-game/
├── conf.lua          # Window size, Love2D version
├── main.lua          # Entry point
├── touch.lua         # Mobile touch controls (optional on desktop)
└── [game modules]    # Player, enemies, etc.
```

### iOS Build Pipeline

See references/ios-setup.md for detailed setup steps.

**Quick overview**:
1. Download Love2D iOS source + Apple libraries
2. Copy libraries to Xcode project
3. Create `game.love` (zip of Lua files)
4. Add `game.love` to Xcode bundle resources
5. Configure signing and deploy

### Update Workflow

Every code change requires rebuilding:

```bash
# From game directory
rm -f game.love
zip -9 -r game.love *.lua [assets/]
cp game.love /path/to/xcode/ios/
# Then build in Xcode (Cmd+R)
```

## Touch Control Patterns

See references/touch-controls.md for implementation details.

### Choosing the Right Pattern

| Game Type | Recommended Control |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Platformer | Virtual joystick + action buttons |
| Puzzle | Direct touch/drag on game objects |
| Endless runner | Tap/swipe gestures |
| Turn-based | Tap to select, tap to confirm |
| Twin-stick | Dual virtual joysticks |

### Touch Event Basics

```lua
function love.touchpressed(id, x, y, dx, dy, pressure)
    -- id: unique per finger (for multitouch)
    -- x, y: screen coordinates
end

function love.touchmoved(id, x, y, dx, dy, pressure)
    -- Track finger movement
end

function love.touchreleased(id, x, y, dx, dy, pressure)
    -- Clean up touch state
end
```

### Platform Detection

```lua
local function isMobile()
    local os = love.system.getOS()
    return os == "iOS" or os == "Android"
end

-- Use this to conditionally show touch controls
if isMobile() then
    touchControls = require("touch")
end
```

---

## Screen Adaptation

### Dynamic Sizing

Never hard-code 800x600. Always query dimensions:

```lua
local screenW, screenH

function love.load()
    screenW, screenH = love.graphics.getDimensions()
end

function love.resize(w, h)
    screenW, screenH = w, h
    -- Reposition UI, regenerate layouts
end
```

### Positioning Strategies

**Percentage-based**:
```lua
local buttonX = screenW * 0.85  -- 85% from left
local buttonY = screenH * 0.9   -- 90% from top
```

**Anchor-based**:
```lua
local margin = 20
local rightEdge = screenW - margin
local bottomEdge = screenH - margin
```

**Aspect-ratio aware**:
```lua
local targetAspect = 16/9
local currentAspect = screenW / screenH
-- Add letterboxing or adjust game area
```

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Hard-coded coordinates**
```lua
-- BAD: Breaks on different screens
player.x = 400
button.y = 550
```
Why bad: iPhone SE and iPad Pro have very different dimensions.
Better: Use percentages or anchor points relative to screen size.

❌ **Ignoring the "No-game screen"**
Why bad: Your game.love wasn't bundled—the app is working, your game isn't loaded.
Better: Verify game.love is in "Copy Bundle Resources" build phase.

❌ **Testing only on simulator**
Why bad: Simulator has different performance, touch behavior, and screen characteristics.
Better: Deploy to a real device early and often.

❌ **Giant virtual joysticks**
Why bad: Obscures gameplay, feels clunky.
Better: Semi-transparent, appropriately sized (60-80px radius), positioned in thumb-reach zones.

❌ **Copying Xcode project changes blindly**
Why bad: You won't know how to fix it when it breaks differently.
Better: Understand the project.pbxproj structure—PBXBuildFile, PBXFileReference, build phases.

❌ **Forgetting to rebuild game.love**
Why bad: You're testing old code and wondering why changes don't work.
Better: Script the rebuild process. Make it one command.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Deployment Target Errors

**Error**: `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET is set to 8.0, but range is 12.0 to X.X`

**Fix**:
```bash
find . -name "*.pbxproj" -exec sed -i '' \
  's/IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 8.0/IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 15.0/g' {} \;
```

### "No-game screen" on Device

**Cause**: game.love not in bundle resources.

**Fix**: Add game.love to Xcode project:
1. Right-click ios folder → Add Files
2. Select game.love
3. Ensure "Add to targets: love-ios" is checked

If that fails, see references/xcode-project-structure.md for manual pbxproj editing.

### Signing Errors

**Fix**: In Xcode:
1. Select love-ios target
2. Signing & Capabilities → Select your Team
3. Change Bundle Identifier to something unique

### Touch Not Responding

**Causes**:
- Not implementing touch callbacks
- Touch area too small (minimum 44x44 points recommended)
- Touch being consumed by wrong element

---

## Variation Guidance

**Touch control layouts should vary based on**:
- Game genre (platformer vs puzzle vs action)
- Screen size (phone vs tablet)
- Player handedness (consider offering options)
- Game complexity (fewer buttons for simpler games)

**Avoid converging on**:
- Always using virtual joystick (sometimes gestures are better)
- Always putting fire button bottom-right (context matters)
- Fixed button sizes (adapt to screen)

## File Locations Reference

| Purpose | Path |
|---------|------|
| Xcode project | `love-X.X-ios-source/platform/xcode/love.xcodeproj` |
| iOS libraries | `love-X.X-ios-source/platform/xcode/ios/libraries/` |
| game.love destination | `love-X.X-ios-source/platform/xcode/ios/game.love` |
| Project config | `love.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` |

---

## Remember

Love2D makes game development joyful. iOS deployment adds friction, but understanding the pipeline—not just following steps—makes you resilient when things break.

**The goal isn't "run on iOS." The goal is "feel great on iOS."**

Touch controls that feel native, layouts that adapt gracefully, and a build process you understand—that's the standard.

Claude is capable of building complete, polished mobile games. These guidelines illuminate the path from desktop prototype to iOS deployment.
