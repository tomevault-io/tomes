# Update Minervia

Check for updates and apply them safely while preserving your customizations.

## Why This Matters

Minervia evolves with new skills, bug fixes, and improvements. The update system:
- Detects files you've customized (via checksum comparison)
- Preserves your changes unless you choose to overwrite
- Creates backups before any modifications
- Shows what's new between versions

## Quick Start

Run the update:

```bash
bash ~/.minervia/bin/minervia-update.sh
```

Or preview changes first:

```bash
bash ~/.minervia/bin/minervia-update.sh --dry-run
```

## What Happens During Update

1. **Version check** - Compares installed version to latest on GitHub
2. **Changelog** - Shows what's new since your version
3. **Customization scan** - Identifies files you've modified
4. **Conflict resolution** - For each customized file, you choose:
   - Keep mine (skip this file)
   - Take theirs (use new version)
   - Backup + overwrite (save yours, use new)
5. **Backup** - Creates timestamped backup of all tracked files
6. **Update** - Applies changes to non-customized files
7. **Report** - Shows what was updated

## Options

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--dry-run` | Show what would change without applying |
| `-v, --verbose` | Show detailed file-by-file actions |
| `--list-backups` | Show available backups |
| `--restore TIMESTAMP` | Restore from a specific backup |

## Backups

Backups are stored in `~/.minervia/backups/` with timestamped folders:
- `2026-01-18T10-30-00/` contains all tracked files as of that update
- Backups are kept forever (no auto-pruning)

To restore from a backup:
```bash
bash ~/.minervia/bin/minervia-update.sh --restore 2026-01-18T10-30-00
```

## Process for Claude

1. Check if update script exists: `ls ~/.minervia/bin/minervia-update.sh`
2. If missing, inform user to reinstall Minervia
3. Run update with appropriate flags based on user request
4. Report results to user

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Update script executed successfully
- [ ] User informed of version changes
- [ ] Customized files handled per user preference
- [ ] Backup created before modifications
