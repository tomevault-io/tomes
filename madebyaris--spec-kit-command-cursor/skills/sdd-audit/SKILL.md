# SDD Audit Skill

Compare implementations against specifications and generate structured review reports.

## When to Use

- Code review before marking tasks complete
- Quality assurance checks
- Verifying implementation matches spec

## Workflow

1. **Load specs**: Read `spec.md` → `plan.md` → `tasks.md`
2. **Identify scope**: Check `todo-list.md` for completed work
3. **Inspect code**: Review implementation for each task
4. **Gap analysis**: Compare spec requirements vs actual code
5. **Generate report**: Structured findings with severity levels

## Audit Checklist

Reference `references/checklist.md` for the complete audit checklist.

## Severity Levels

- **CRITICAL**: Broken functionality, security risk, release blocker
- **MAJOR**: Logic error, missing feature, significant bug
- **MINOR**: Style issue, optimization opportunity, cleanup
- **OUTDATED**: Code correct but spec needs updating

## Report Format

```markdown
## Audit Report: [Feature]

**Status:** Pass | Fail | Warnings

### Quick Stats
- CRITICAL: [N] | MAJOR: [N] | MINOR: [N]

### Review Comments
| ID | Severity | Location | Issue | Recommendation |

### Spec Compliance
| Requirement | Status | Evidence |

### Recommended Actions
1. [Priority action]
```

## Integration

- Works with `sdd-verifier` subagent for automated validation
- Can trigger `scripts/validate.sh` for automated checks
- Use the ask question tool if audit criteria are unclear
