# Todo Handling Skill

Use this skill for deliberately authored, durable work ownership and status tracking. Todos are the live company ledger; Workflows are the reusable HOW. Search before creating a duplicate. A Workflow invocation never creates, links, transitions, approves, or mutates a Todo.

## Find the right Todo

- Use `list_work_items` for recent work or structured filters such as `status`, `source`, `assignee`, `department`, and `needsAttentionFor`.
- Use `list_work_items` with `rootsOnly: true` for an objective-level view, `parentId` for one Todo's direct children, or `rootId` for a whole Todo family.
- Use `search_work_items` when you have text or several filters. It requires at least one real filter.
- Use `get_work_item` before changing a Todo so you understand its acceptance criteria, assignee, source/provenance, verification policy, and current status.
- Use `get_work_item_tree` when the work has child Todos; it returns the nested breakdown and roll-up.

The statuses are `backlog`, `assigned`, `executing`, `in_review`, `done`, `blocked`, `escalated`, and `cancelled`. Agent updates intentionally expose only `in_review`, `blocked`, `escalated`, and `done`; other lifecycle decisions stay on their owning surface.

## Shape the hierarchy

One operator outcome should normally map to one root Todo. A checklist does not imply one Todo per item. Keep procedural steps, commands, and release checklists in the root Todo body, comments, or session activity.

Only independently assignable or independently reviewable deliverables become child Todos. Create child Todos with `parentId`:

```json
{
  "title": "Verify release artifacts",
  "parentId": "ACM-42",
  "assignee": "a-reviewer",
  "acceptance": "Checks pass and evidence is attached."
}
```

If another skill asks for one Todo per checklist step, use engine-local progress tracking unless each step passes this durable-work boundary. This Jinn Todo doctrine governs the company ledger. Keep trees shallow and outcome-shaped; do not turn implementation procedures into ledger clutter.

## Create and assign

Create a Todo only for durable work that needs an owner or review trail:

```json
{
  "title": "Verify release candidate",
  "body": "Run the release checks and attach the evidence.",
  "acceptance": "Typecheck, tests, lint, and build pass with command output.",
  "assignee": "a-reviewer",
  "department": "engineering",
  "verifyPolicy": {
    "mode": "verify",
    "verifier": { "employee": "a-lead" },
    "maxRounds": 4
  }
}
```

1. Search for an existing item covering the same outcome.
2. Call `create_work_item` with a concise title, enough context to act, and testable acceptance criteria.
3. Use `assign_work_item` when assignment was not supplied or must change. Verify the employee with `get_employee` or `find_employees` first.
4. Use `delegate_task` instead when the assignee should start immediately; it can use an existing `workItemId` or create and link a new Todo atomically.

Do not invent provenance or attach approval fields during creation. Each owning company surface records its own source provenance.

## Approval flow

Approvals are routed records on a Todo, separate from its lifecycle status. Generic `update_work_item` does not perform approval decisions or review-bounce accounting; never use it as a substitute while an approval is pending.

1. The Todo owner or linked execution session, its manager, or the COO requests a decision with `request_work_item_approval`:

```json
{
  "id": "wi_example",
  "request": "Do the verification artifacts satisfy the acceptance criteria?"
}
```

   Omit `target` to use the default routed manager/COO. Repeating the identical pending request with the same target is idempotent and does not append another approval-requested event. A changed request or target replaces the pending route; there is no self-declared approval state on `create_work_item`.

   Set `operatorOnly: true` to reserve the gate for the human operator when the decision authorizes something irreversible. No employee can then decide it, including the COO and including after an escalation, and the escalation itself is refused. It cannot be combined with `target`.

2. The routed manager/COO decides with `decide_work_item_approval` and an optional evidence note:

```json
{
  "id": "wi_example",
  "decision": "approve",
  "note": "Acceptance checks and artifacts verified."
}
```

   The resolved routed owner cannot decide their own approval, but an employee hierarchy root/COO is exempt from that enforcement check. Linked execution alone is not checked, so routed managers/COO should avoid approving work they personally executed and use another authorized reviewer when possible. For a native approval on an `in_review` Todo, `approve` atomically records the decision and moves the Todo to `done`. `reject` records the critique, returns it to `executing`, and increments `rounds`; when the increment reaches `verifyPolicy.maxRounds`, it moves to `escalated` instead. Without an explicit limit, the effective ceilings are 2 rounds for `trust`/`verify` and 3 for `thorough`. On another status, the decision is recorded but status stays unchanged.

3. After a rejection, the worker revises the work, uses `update_work_item` to return it to `in_review`, and calls `request_work_item_approval` again for the next bounded review. Do not create a duplicate Todo.

4. If the routed manager/COO deliberately needs operator/aCEO authority, call `escalate_work_item_approval` with the pending Todo id and an optional reason. Escalation exposes the pending approval to that path; it does not approve or reject it.

Todo approvals affect only the Todo. Workflow operations never mutate Todos. A Todo-status trigger is a one-way input; the resulting Workflow run is independent.

## Keep status honest

- Worker finished and ready for review: `update_work_item` to `in_review` with a note naming artifacts, checks, and remaining risks.
- Cannot proceed without an external change: move to `blocked` and state the concrete blocker plus what would unblock it.
- A non-approval manager/operator decision is required: move to `escalated` and summarize the options and recommendation. For a pending approval, use `escalate_work_item_approval` instead.
- Reviewer accepts ungated work: move it to `done` with verification evidence. If an approval is pending, use `decide_work_item_approval` instead so the Todo approval consequence is recorded atomically.
- Never mark your own produced work `done`; the reviewer owns completion. Do not use `done` to hide partial work or a failed verification.

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "wi_example",
  "status": "in_review",
  "note": "Implemented the requested change; typecheck, tests, lint, and build are green. Evidence is attached to the child session."
}
```

Use `archive_work_item` for obsolete or historical clutter while preserving its row and audit trail. Cancellation is a human lifecycle decision, not an agent status shortcut.

## Review loop

1. Reviewer calls `get_work_item` and inspects the linked execution session plus any separately supplied evidence.
2. If the Todo has a pending approval, use `decide_work_item_approval`; approve or reject with a precise evidence note.
3. After a rejection, the worker revises, returns the Todo to `in_review`, and requests the next approval. The rejection path increments rounds and auto-escalates when the effective limit is reached.
4. Use `escalate_work_item_approval` before the round cap only when the routed approver needs an operator/aCEO decision.

Report Todo id, title, assignee, status, verification result, and next owner. Do not create a second Todo merely because the first is blocked or under review.
