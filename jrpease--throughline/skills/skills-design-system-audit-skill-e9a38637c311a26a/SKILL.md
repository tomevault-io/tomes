description: Measure a pre-existing design system before retrofitting it onto tokens, so the retrofit is right-sized. This is a PROCESS skill and the brownfield front door. Use this when retrofitting a design system onto a mature codebase and an already-populated Figma file, when the user wants to audit an existing system, size a retrofit, count existing tokens/variables/bindings, or figure out how much work a migration is. Also trigger when figma-environment-setup detects a brownfield situation (existing repo or populated Figma file), before any building. Use when this capability is needed.

# Design-system audit (brownfield front door)

Measures **both sides** of a pre-existing system so a retrofit can be right-sized,
before anything is built or changed. It is the brownfield analog of
`/design-system-status`: where status reports a *local* manifest, this assesses an
*external, mature* system — a real codebase and an already-populated Figma file.

This is a brownfield skill. **Before doing anything, read**
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brownfield-retrofit.md` — especially the
read-discipline principle (never assert absence without a verified read) and the
`audit` phase of the safe sequence. Greenfield builds skip this skill entirely.

## Calibrate

Read `user.codingLevel` (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coding-level.md`) and scale
explanation accordingly. The audit surfaces grep counts and a `percentSemantic`
number — for `new` users explain what each means and why it matters (it decides
rename-vs-rewrite); for `comfortable` users be terse. The measurements are identical
across levels.

## Prerequisites

Read the manifest. This skill needs Figma connected (`figma.connected: true`) for the
inventory step, and a repo path for the code-surface step (`workspace.localPath`). If
Figma isn't connected, offer to run `figma-environment-setup` first. The code-surface
step works on any repo regardless of `workspace.stage`.

## Step 1 — Size the code surface

Measure how many color decisions live in the codebase. Run the color-usage grep
scaffold against the user's repo:

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/grep-color-usage.mjs --root <workspace.localPath>
```

It counts five categories: SCSS color vars, Tailwind color classes, `Colors.*` JS
usages, raw hex + `rgba()` literals, and SVG hardcoded fills — producing the
case-study worklist shape.

**Tune the patterns to the actual repo, and say what you assumed (read discipline +
§11).** The shipped patterns are *defaults*, not ground truth. Before trusting the
counts:
1. Look at the repo's real conventions — open a few SCSS/TS files, check the actual
   color-variable prefixes (`$primary-*`, `$grey-*`, a custom prefix), the Tailwind
   color-class names, and whether colors come through a `Colors.*` object or some other
   accessor.
2. If the defaults don't fit, write a `--config <patterns.json>` of
   `{ "<category>": { "files": "<regex>", "pattern": "<regex>" } }` tuned to this repo
   and re-run with it.
3. **Report which categories used the assumed defaults vs. a tuned pattern** — never
   present default-pattern counts as if they were measured. The script prints this; pass
   it through to the user so partial coverage is visible, not hidden.

**Don't assume the stack.** The categories are color-specific but framework-agnostic; a
repo with no Tailwind simply scores `0` there. Detect what the repo actually uses (is
there a `tailwind.config`? SCSS? CSS-in-JS?) and explain the counts in those terms.

## Step 1.5 — Size the documentation surface

Inventory existing documentation the same way the code surface is sized — from
**verified reads, never assumptions**. Per component (or per code component when no
Figma component exists yet), record whether usage docs already exist and where:

- **Code:** JSDoc/TSDoc on the component, an `.mdx` doc page, a per-component
  README.
- **Figma:** a populated component `description` field.

Write the totals to `audit.docSurface` in the manifest, e.g. `{ "documented": 12,
"undocumented": 34, "sources": { "codeJsdoc": 8, "mdx": 4, "figmaDescription": 6,
"readme": 3 } }`. This right-sizes the documentation retrofit (how much exists to
adopt vs. author from scratch) so `retrofit-planner`'s `docs` phase can be planned
against real numbers. See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/component-doc-schema.md`
for what a full record contains.

## Step 2 — Inventory the Figma file (verified per-class reads)

Variables, text styles, and effect/paint styles are **different surfaces** — read each
independently and report "none" only for the class whose own read came back empty
(read discipline, fixes B2). Before counting variables, ensure all pages are loaded
(`await figma.loadAllPagesAsync()`); treat a `0` on first read as suspect and re-read
before reporting (fixes B1).

- **Variables** — `figma_get_variables` (handles `dynamic-page`, resolves aliases).
  Record the count.
- **Bindings** — run the binding-survival audit snippet in
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/figma-scripting.md` to count consuming bindings.
  This is the load-bearing number: it's what a careless rename would destroy.
- **Text styles** — `figma_get_text_styles`. Record the count.
- **Effect/paint styles** — `figma_get_styles`. Record the count.
- **Modes** — record the mode names per collection (e.g. `["Light", "Dark"]`).

Never report a count you didn't read. If a read genuinely returns empty after a
reliable load, that's a real `0`; if it's suspect, re-read or ask the user once and
persist — never guess.

## Step 3 — Compute "% semantic"

From the inventory, estimate how much of the existing system is already **semantic**
(named by role — `text/default`, `surface/raised`) vs. **raw/primitive** (named by
value — `grey-900`, or bare hex). Report it as an integer 0–100 (`audit.percentSemantic`).

This single number right-sizes the retrofit: a largely-semantic system (~90%) is a
**rename-in-place + cleanup** job; a low-semantic one is closer to a **rewrite**.
Surface it early and plainly — "you're ~90% semantic, so this is mostly renames and a
cleanup, not a rebuild" — so the user calibrates effort before committing.

## Step 4 — Write the manifest and recommend the next step

Write the `audit` section (this skill owns it):

- `codeSurface` — the per-category counts from Step 1 (keys vary by what the repo uses;
  omit categories that don't apply rather than reporting a misleading `0`).
- `figmaInventory` — `{ variables, bindings, textStyles, effectStyles, modes }` from
  Step 2's verified reads.
- `percentSemantic` — the integer from Step 3.
- `ranAt` — the current ISO timestamp.

Set `tokens.intakeMode: "retrofit"` (this skill establishes the brownfield path — it
owns this transition). Append `design-system-audit` to `completedSkills`.

Then recommend the next step:
- Report the documentation debt from `audit.docSurface` (documented vs.
  undocumented) and note that the retrofit's `docs` phase will adopt existing docs
  before authoring the gaps.
- If the user wants the guided, gated end-to-end retrofit → **`retrofit-planner`**
  (the orchestrator; recommended for multi-session retrofits).
- If they only want the crosswalk backbone next → **`token-crosswalk-builder`** (it
  reads this `audit` section to seed its rows).

## What this skill must NOT do

- Never build, rename, or delete anything — this is a **measurement** skill. Changes
  belong to `token-builder` (refine), the retrofit phases, and cleanup.
- Never report a count without a verified read (read discipline). An unexpectedly-empty
  read is a suspected error, not ground truth.
- Never present default grep patterns as measured truth — say what was assumed.
- Never assume the case-study stack (Tailwind/SCSS/Chromatic). Detect what the repo
  actually uses and degrade gracefully.
- Never write another skill's manifest fields (e.g. `tokenCrosswalk`, `retrofit.phase`).
- Never overwrite `workspace.origin` — it is immutable after intake.
