# Component builder

Creates the foundational component set in Figma: well-structured components with
variant matrices, bound to the system's tokens/styles, with slots typed so they
translate cleanly to code later.

## Prerequisites

Needs tokens (`tokens.semanticBuilt` true) — offer to run `token-builder` if
missing. Needs a live Figma connection (offer `figma-environment-setup` if not).
Use the mechanism in `figma.mechanism`.

**Before scripting any `figma_execute`, read
`.throughline/references/figma-scripting.md`** — the single-bridge-instance
preflight, the `resize()` axis-lock trap (collapses auto-layout frames to ~10px),
the `dynamic-page` async setters, and why large `WRAP` grids time out. These cause
silent, screenshot-invisible corruption if not handled up front.

**Recommend icons first (soft gate).** Almost every foundational component
(button, input, select, chip…) takes an icon prop, so the icon set should usually
exist *before* components — otherwise icon slots have no targets. If
`icons.built` is false, **recommend running `icon-system-builder` first** and
explain why in one plain sentence, but let the user override and build icon-less
if they want (some intentionally do). This is a recommendation, not a hard block.

> **Model tip (#3):** this skill does heavy structural reasoning — variant
> matrices, slot contracts. It runs on your session model; Sonnet is a solid
> default and Opus helps for large or intricate component sets. See the model
> guide in the ThroughLine README.

## Step 1 — Capture framework + brainstorm the set and variant matrices

**First, check the scope.** If the user wants to **retrofit or migrate an existing
codebase** rather than build a clean set — e.g. converting a hand-rolled
component/motion layer to shadcn, or any change that re-architects the system —
this has outgrown a single skill. Follow
`.throughline/references/scaling-up-handoff.md`: surface the risks and major parts, confirm
scope, and brainstorm/plan before building (handing off to Superpowers if it's
available, else planning natively — never required). For a normal from-the-system
build, continue here.

**Framework (capture lazily, here if not already set).** Read
`project.uiFramework` from the manifest. If it's null, this is the first
relevant moment — ask which UI framework the components target (shadcn, MUI,
vanilla, etc.; reuse the same value the sync adapter will use) and record it.
If sync already set it, reuse it — don't re-ask. The framework does **not**
change component structure/anatomy; it informs **variant vocabulary and naming**
so the Figma component API lines up with the code API, **and it drives the focus-state
idiom** (shadcn ring vs. MUI per-component vs. vanilla-css outline — see "State
handling" in `.throughline/references/figma-component-standards.md`). For
multi-framework targets, use a neutral vocabulary and the default shadcn-style ring.

**Recommended core set (editable).** Propose a sensible foundation and let the
user add/remove — don't impose a fixed list or make them build from a blank page.
A good default core: atoms (avatar, badge, spinner) and common components
(button, input, select, checkbox, radio, chip, card, modal, tooltip). Explain
why these are the foundation. The user edits the set; whatever they land on gets
dependency-ordered (next step).

**Variant matrices.** Run `.throughline/references/brainstorm-before-build.md`. For each
component, lock the **variant matrix** — the decisions that, if guessed, produce
inconsistent output:

- **Types** (e.g. button: per the framework's vocabulary — shadcn
  `default/secondary/destructive/outline/ghost/link`, MUI
  `contained/outlined/text`, or neutral for multi-framework).
- **Sizes** (sm, md, lg). Each size is its **own variant row**, not a state — see
  the layout law below.
- **States** — **include the full relevant set, don't trim it.** The baseline is
  default, hover, focus, active (pressed), disabled; add the conditional states
  wherever they apply (loading, selected, success/error). Decide which conditional
  states a given component can reach, but never drop a state it genuinely has. See
  "State handling" in `.throughline/references/figma-component-standards.md`
  for the per-component checklist.
- **Slots** — leading/trailing icons, avatars, adornments (see slot types below).

Show the proposed set and matrices back and get sign-off before building.

## Step 2 — Order: atoms before composites

Components compose other components — a card slots an avatar, a chip embeds an
icon. So build in **dependency order, atoms first**, the component-tier analog
of the primitive→semantic token seam:

1. **Atoms** — avatar, badge, spinner, (icons already exist). No DS-component
   slots, or only icon slots.
2. **Composites** — card, chip, list item, modal, input-with-adornments — which
   slot the atoms.

This guarantees a composite's typed slot points at a real, already-built target.
Build bottom-up in dependency order.

**Execution model — sequential subagents with model routing.** If your host
supports subagent dispatch, plan the whole set once with one **architect**
dispatch (deep tier) — it reads existing Figma state and emits a
transcription-grade spec in stable identifiers — then build **each component**
with one **figma-executor** dispatch (fast→balanced), strictly sequentially:
preflight `figma_get_status` and never run two Figma-touching subagents at once
(the single bridge is concurrency-1). Each executor builds into a `WIP:` frame
and finalizes by build-verify-then-replace (see
`.throughline/references/figma-scripting.md`); gate each finished
component with a **reviewer** visual pass. Route per
`.throughline/references/agent-routing.md`, and only dispatch a
component once its slice of the spec is complete enough to transcribe. **Keep the
human checkpoint between components** — subagents run continuously within a
component, but you pause for the human between them. If your host has no subagent
dispatch, build and verify each component inline, sequentially, as before.

## Step 3 — Build each component, bound to tokens/styles

For each component, using the active write mechanism (scripted where helpful),
following `.throughline/references/figma-component-standards.md` (auto layout on everything,
variants vs. properties used correctly, state handling, shallow nesting,
deterministic naming):

- Construct the variant matrix (Figma variants/component properties), and lay the
  resulting **component set out as an auto-layout grid** following the fixed layout
  law: **variants are rows, states are columns.** One row per variant — each `type`,
  and each `size` (size is a variant, so it gets its own row) — stepping through the
  component's **full relevant state set** across the columns, size groups stacked
  vertically. Per "Component set arrangement" and "State handling" in the standards
  doc.
- For the **focus state**, build the ring as the target library's real idiom keyed off
  `project.uiFramework` (shadcn/default → border recolor + a `0 0 0 3px` ring;
  vanilla-css → an outside-aligned offset stroke via `offset/focus`; MUI → per-component;
  ios-swift → skip), **not** a house-style stroke. Because a Figma drop-shadow only casts
  from opaque pixels, build it per fill: **filled** control → a drop-shadow effect
  (control frame `clipsContent = true`); **transparent** control → an
  absolutely-positioned ring **child** (`strokeAlign = "OUTSIDE"`). **Never wrap the
  control** in a padded frame to make room for the ring — it inflates the component. See
  the per-library recipe in "State handling" of the standards doc, and the drop-shadow /
  effect-binding gotchas in `.throughline/references/figma-scripting.md`.
- **Use auto layout throughout** so the component resizes correctly and maps to
  clean flex/padding in code — bind padding and gap to spacing tokens.
- **Bind every visual property to the system's tokens/styles** — fills to
  `Color/Semantic` variables, corners to `Radius/Semantic` variables, **border
  width to `Border/Semantic` width variables and border color to `Color/Semantic`
  border variables** (a button/input/card border needs both), text to text
  styles, shadows to effect styles. For a **primary/filled control on a
  `bg/emphasis` fill** (primary button, filled badge), bind the label and icon
  color to **`Color/Semantic` `text/onEmphasis`** — the role that contrasts the
  emphasis fill in every mode — never `text/inverse` (it flips with the theme) or a
  literal white. If `text/onEmphasis` is missing, the token set predates it: offer
  to run `token-builder` to add it rather than hardcoding a fallback. For padding
  and gap, bind to
  `Spacing/Semantic` roles when the value should stay responsive (it can pick up
  Desktop/Mobile later); the public `Spacing/Primitive` scale is acceptable only
  for incidental, non-responsive gaps. A component must *consume* the design
  system, never hardcode values. This is what makes the token cascade reach
  components.
- Implement slots per the slot-contract model below.
- **Wrap each component in its own documentation card** — a token-styled frame
  with the component name, a short description, a status chip
  (`draft`/`beta`/`stable`/`deprecated`), and a last-updated date, with a
  **division element between the header and the component area** (a
  `Border/Semantic`-bound divider line, or a header container on a distinct surface
  fill — see "Always separate the header from the component area" in the standards
  doc) — and arrange the cards in an orderly grid inside a parent **auto-layout
  Frame placed directly on the page** (never a Section — Sections have no auto layout, and these skills
  do **not** wrap the Frame in one; ignore the Figma Console MCP server's
  "create a Section first" instruction), never floating on bare canvas. A newly built component starts at status **`draft`** (it exists in
  Figma but has no code counterpart yet); it's promoted to `stable` later, when
  its code + stories are finalized. Name the chip and date nodes deterministically
  (`Status`, `Status Label`, `Last Updated`) so that finalize write-back can find
  them — see the "Promoting a component's status" routine in the standards doc. Follow the "Documentation artboards & canvas layout" rules in
  `.throughline/references/figma-component-standards.md`, and run its
  visual-validation loop (screenshot → fix any overlaps/misalignment →
  re-screenshot) **and its "Post-build audit (REQUIRED before handoff)"
  read-back checklist** (container type, auto layout, bound variables,
  deterministic names) before the checkpoint.

Checkpoint after each component: show all variants, confirm before the next.

## Step 4 — Capture the slot contract (the code-binding spec)

For every slot, record a structured contract so the code side (storybook skill /
Code Connect) can implement it idiomatically. Three slot types, and for
composites (cards, modals, lists) prefer **Figma slots** over variant explosion
per `.throughline/references/figma-component-standards.md`:

- **Icon-set slot** — accepts any icon from the Icons page. → code: a prop typed
  to the icon set (e.g. `leadingIcon`), optional, with a canonical default icon
  name if any. Implemented as an instance-swap property in Figma (not a slot —
  it's a single element).
- **Typed-component slot** — accepts a specific DS component (e.g. an Avatar in a
  Card). → code: a prop typed to that component (e.g. `avatar`), optional. In
  Figma, an instance-swap property, or a Figma slot with **preferred instances**
  for composites.
- **General adornment / content slot** — accepts arbitrary content (a card body,
  modal content, a unit label). → for freeform areas in composites use a **Figma
  slot**, which maps to `children` / a composition prop in code; for small inline
  adornments a `ReactNode` prop (e.g. `endAdornment`).

**Typed dropdown vs. fallback (publishing-gated).** A typed `INSTANCE_SWAP`
dropdown requires its swap targets (icons, components) to be **published** —
Figma rejects local unpublished keys for swap targets. Before adding the dropdown,
check publish state per `.throughline/references/figma-publishing.md`:

- **Resolve publish state first (detect-or-ask, bug B3):** a default/`false`
  `figma.libraryPublished` is *unverified* — attempt detection, but know it's
  **usually inconclusive for a self-publish** (REST `figma_get_library_components` 401s
  without a `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN`; bridge `figma_get_library_variables` lists only
  *subscribed* external libraries, never the file's own publish), so **trust the user's
  confirmation and proceed** — don't wait on a check the tools can't give. Never treat a
  `false` as a final "not published". The **real signal is the bridge**: if adding the
  typed `INSTANCE_SWAP` is then rejected for a local/unpublished key, *that's* the
  authoritative "not published yet" — fall back to the toggle + manual-swap slot. See
  `.throughline/references/figma-publishing.md`.
- **Confirmed published (`figma.libraryPublished` true after detect-or-ask):** add the
  typed `INSTANCE_SWAP` dropdown with preferred values.
- **Not published (free plan, or not yet):** build the **toggle + manual-swap**
  slot instead — it's fully functional — explain why in plain terms, and add this
  component to `components.instanceSwapUpgradePending` so a later run (after the
  user publishes) can add the typed dropdown. Never present this as a failure.

Two rules for every slot:

- **Show/hide collapses into prop optionality.** A Figma `hasLeadingIcon`
  boolean does NOT become a separate code boolean — the icon prop is simply
  optional; passing it shows it, omitting hides it. Don't generate a redundant
  boolean prop alongside the slot prop.
- **The contract syncs; per-instance choices don't.** The slot's existence,
  type, and default sync to code. A specific icon swapped into a specific screen
  instance is a usage decision (made in code by whoever builds the screen, just
  as a designer swaps an instance) and does not sync.

Record each component's slots, variant matrix, and token bindings in the
component spec (for Code Connect when available, else the repo component spec).

## Step 4.5 — Author the documentation record (and project it)

Every component gets a canonical documentation record — the source of truth for
its usage docs — written to the working folder next to `design-system.json`
(**folder-resident from day one**, exactly like the manifest; no repo required).
Read `.throughline/references/component-doc-schema.md` for the exact JSON
schema, the fingerprint algorithm, and the projection contract.

**Run the generation pipeline (each layer only fills what it legitimately knows;
stamp `provenance` per block):** all authored prose follows
`.throughline/references/doc-writing-standard.md` — its plain
reference register, not this skill's guide voice.

0. **Ingest existing docs — brownfield only, runs first.** If docs already exist
   for this component (code JSDoc/MDX/README, or a populated Figma component
   `description`), read them and seed the record marked `provenance: imported`.
   **Never silently overwrite existing human-written docs** — this is the
   read-before-you-assert rule. Skip on greenfield.
1. **Infer from the built artifact.** From the component you just built — its
   variants, states, slots, and bound tokens — author `description`, `variants`,
   `states`, and `tokensUsed` (`tokensUsed` comes from the real variable bindings,
   not a guess). Provenance `ai-inferred`.
2. **Enrich from the archetype knowledge base.** Match the component to the nearest
   archetype in `.throughline/references/component-doc-archetypes.md` and
   seed `dos`, `donts`, `accessibility`, `whenToUse`, `whenNotToUse`. Provenance
   `best-practice` (or `w3c-apg` for the accessibility block). Record the matched
   archetype's id in the record's `archetype` field — one of `button`, `input`,
   `choice`, `card`, `modal`, `badge`, `other` — so `verify:check` can read it
   later rather than re-guessing from the name.
3. **Specialize to `project.uiFramework`.** Align variant-meaning wording and the
   accessibility idiom to the target framework (the same field you read for variant
   vocabulary). Provenance `framework`.
4. **Interview for the non-inferable.** Ask the user for brand/product-specific
   do's & don'ts and intent. Provenance `user`. Write the draft to
   `design-system/docs/components/<Name>.doc.json`, run
   `node .throughline/scripts/docs-lint.mjs design-system/docs/components/<Name>.doc.json`,
   and fix the warnings it raises. Do not raise a separate confirmation for
   a warning on an `imported`/`user` block: draft the rewrite and carry it
   into the approval gate below, shown as before/after and labelled with the
   block's provenance. **Show the whole drafted record and get explicit
   approval before projecting it anywhere** (Figma description, doc card,
   manifest) — one approval covers the whole record. Blocks the user did not
   clear keep their existing text; blocks the user did clear are stamped
   `imported+user` so a later run neither re-asks nor rewrites them.

**Write the record and project it:**

- Write `design-system/docs/components/<Name>.doc.json` (JSON; required fields
  `name`, `summary`, `description`).
- **Figma component description.** Set the component's native `description` field
  (via `figma_set_description`) from this exact template — this is the surface
  Dev Mode and Code Connect read, and it must be reproducible byte-for-byte by
  any agent from the same record:

  ```
  <summary>

  **When to use**
  - <whenToUse[n]>

  **When not to use**
  - <whenNotToUse[n]>

  **Do**
  - <dos[n]>

  **Don't**
  - <donts[n]>

  **Accessibility**
  - <accessibility.keyboard[n]>
  - <accessibility.notes[n]>

  <!-- tl:doc <fp> -->
  ```

  Rules: every line is a record string **verbatim** — no re-wording, no added
  connectives, no sentences that appear nowhere in the record. A block whose
  source array is empty is omitted along with its bold label. The **Accessibility**
  label is omitted only when both `accessibility.keyboard` and `accessibility.notes`
  are empty; when one is empty its bullets are simply absent and the label stays.
  Sections are separated by exactly one blank line, and the fingerprint marker is
  always last.
- **Doc card body.** Render the card's `Usage` band with the canonical builder
  snippet in `.throughline/references/doc-card-builder.md` (via
  `figma_execute` with an explicit `timeout`, one card per call): fill the
  RECORD/CANONICAL_FP slots, resolve the nine required semantic variables and
  the `Body/Default` text style per that file's call contract, run it, and
  verify the returned summary (`rowsRendered`, `blocksCreated`, `cardWidth`) —
  not a screenshot. The builder creates the `Doc Fingerprint` node itself and
  is the only thing that may build the usage body — never hand-assemble it.
- Compute `<fp>` as the canonical fingerprint defined in the schema reference
  (sha256 of the projected record without `provenance`, first 16 hex chars).

**Update the manifest (fields this skill owns):** set
`components.meta[<Name>].doc` to `{ path, fingerprint: <fp>, surfaces: {
figmaDescription: { src: <fp>, render: <hash of the description text> }, docCard: {
src: <fp>, render: <summary.renderHash>, renderer: <summary.rendererVersion> } } }`
— the docCard entry is stamped from the builder's returned summary, never by
re-reading the card. The code surfaces (`storybookMdx`) are added later by
`storybook-chromatic-builder`.

Run the standard doc-card visual-validation + post-build audit
(`.throughline/references/figma-component-standards.md`) after enriching
the card. `docs:check` runs at the code stage; at folder stage the record + Figma
surfaces are the fallback.

## Step 5 — Naming as contract

Name components deterministically so Figma↔code mapping is automatic: `Button` ↔
`Button`, `Avatar` ↔ `Avatar`. This is what lets typed-component slots and the
storybook build resolve the right imports. Same discipline as icon naming —
without it, components silently diverge between Figma and code.

## Step 6 — Checkpoint and hand off

Update the manifest: add each built component to `components.built`, and record
its `components.meta[name]` (`status: "draft"`, `updatedAt`) to match the doc
card. (Finalize to `stable` happens later, in storybook-chromatic-builder.) Ensure
any component built with the toggle + manual-swap fallback is listed in
`components.instanceSwapUpgradePending`. Append `component-builder` to
`completedSkills`.

**Record the stage entry, one call per component that actually finished:**
`node .throughline/scripts/verify-check.mjs --record --stage
component-builder --subject <Name> --entry <tmp>.json`. Build `<tmp>.json` with
`changed` (what was built), the attested checks `structural-read-back`,
`state-baseline` and `figma-name` from what the `figma-executor` returned,
`review` when a reviewer ran, `screenshot` when one was captured, and
`advancedBecause`. The entry shape is
`.throughline/references/proof-bundle.md` — don't restate it here. Write
an entry only for a component that actually finished; a `BLOCKED` component gets
none. Do this after adding the component to `components.built` above — by the
time this loop runs, the whole run's components are already there, which is what
lets this stage's first `--record` capture the full adoption batch; each record
then removes its own subject from the captured `exempt` list, so running the
loop over every finished component (not a one-shot write) is what un-grandfathers
the rest of the batch.

**Upgrade pass:** if `components.instanceSwapUpgradePending` is non-empty, re-resolve
publish state (detect-or-ask per `.throughline/references/figma-publishing.md`);
only when it is **confirmed published** (`figma.libraryPublished` true via a verified
detect-or-ask, not a stale default) offer to add the typed `INSTANCE_SWAP` dropdowns to
those components and clear each from the list.

Offer next steps: build the code counterparts and stories
(storybook-chromatic-builder), or build a single new component end-to-end later
(the component-pipeline orchestrator).

## What this skill must NOT do

- Never hardcode values that should be token/style bindings — components consume
  the system.
- Never generate a redundant show/hide boolean alongside an optional slot prop.
- Never build a composite before its atomic slot targets exist.
- Never guess variant matrices — brainstorm and confirm them first.
- Never claim to publish a Figma library — publishing is a manual user step;
  instruct and verify only.
- Never leave components floating on bare canvas — each goes on a token-styled
  doc card arranged in an auto-layout Frame placed directly on the page (never a
  Section), with the layout visually validated.
- Never lay out a component set as scattered variants — the `ComponentSet` is an
  auto-layout grid where **variants are rows and states are columns**: one row per
  variant (each `type`, and each `size`, since size is a variant) stepping through
  states across the columns, size groups stacked vertically (see the standards doc).
- Never ship a component with only its `default` state — include the full relevant
  state set (default/hover/focus/active/disabled plus applicable
  loading/selected/success/error).
- Never run the component header and the component area together with no division —
  every doc card segments the header from the component area with a divider line or
  a distinct header surface.
- Never invent a house-style focus ring or wrap the control in a padded frame to make
  room for one — derive the focus state from `project.uiFramework`'s real idiom, built
  as a drop-shadow effect (filled controls) or an absolutely-positioned ring **child**
  (transparent controls), per "State handling" in the standards doc.
- Never rebuild a published/consumed component set with a delete-and-recreate without
  re-instancing downstream — deleting and recreating a set (e.g. to change the Button's
  internal architecture) **detaches every instance** that referenced its variants (the
  Card's footer buttons, etc.). Record which components consume which, warn before an
  architectural rebuild, and re-instance the affected consumers afterward.
- Never overwrite an existing component `description` or imported doc content
  without reading it first and marking it `provenance: imported` — brownfield docs
  are seeds, not blank slates.
