description: Build the brownfield token crosswalk — a persistent three-way map between each new token, the old Figma variable, and the old code identifier(s) — then wire the tokens:validate CI gate. Use this when retrofitting a design system onto a mature codebase, when the user wants to map old tokens to new ones, build a crosswalk, set up tokens:validate, or generate a reverse index for SCSS/Tailwind swaps. Also trigger when retrofit-planner reaches the crosswalk stage, or after design-system-audit has sized the retrofit. Use when this capability is needed.

# Token crosswalk builder

Builds the **backbone artifact** of a brownfield retrofit: `crosswalk.json`, a
persistent three-way map of **new token ↔ old Figma variable ↔ old code identifier**.
It drives the code retrofit and the `tokens:validate` CI gate. This skill also
installs the canonical scripts into the user's repo and wires the gate.

This is a brownfield skill. **Before doing anything, read**
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brownfield-retrofit.md` (read discipline, the 7
guardrails, the safe sequence) and
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/crosswalk-schema.md` (the exact contract). Greenfield
builds don't need this skill.

## Calibrate

Read `user.codingLevel` (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/coding-level.md`) and scale
explanation accordingly. The crosswalk involves JSON, npm scripts, and a CI gate — for
`new` users explain each plainly the first time; for `comfortable` users be terse.
Actions are identical across levels.

## Prerequisites (offer to run them, don't bail)

Read the manifest. This skill needs:

1. **A DTCG token source** at `packages/tokens/dtcg/tokens.json` — the validator
   resolves against it. If it doesn't exist, offer to run `token-sync-layer` first
   (it emits this file). Apply the read discipline: confirm the file exists by
   reading it, never assume it's absent without looking.
2. **The audit inputs** — ideally the `audit` manifest section (code surface,
   Figma inventory, `percentSemantic`) populated by `design-system-audit`. If
   `audit` is present, use it to seed the rows. If it is `null` (audit hasn't run —
   it lands in Plan 3), don't block: ask the user for the old→new mapping inputs
   directly (which old Figma variables and code symbols map to which new tokens),
   and proceed. Note plainly that running `design-system-audit` first would
   pre-fill this.
3. **A repo at `local-git` or `github`** (`workspace.stage`) so the installed
   scripts and `package.json` changes land as a reviewable diff/PR. If still
   `folder`, offer `repository-builder`.

## Step 1 — Build `crosswalk.json`

Write `packages/tokens/crosswalk.json` per the contract in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/crosswalk-schema.md`. One row per new token:

- `newToken` — the DTCG dot-path exactly as it appears in
  `packages/tokens/dtcg/tokens.json` (e.g. `color.text.primary`).
- `newValue` — the **resolved** leaf value (follow `{…}` aliases to the literal).
- `tier` — `primitive` or `semantic`.
- `figmaOld` — the old Figma variable name/path, or `null` if newly added.
- `codeTokens[]` — the old code identifiers this token replaces (`$primary-red`,
  `bg-primary-red`, `Colors.primaryRed`, `--primary-red`). May be `[]`.
- `status` — `aligned | renamed | drift-fix | added | mapped-nearest`. Assign by:
  same name & value → `aligned`; same value, new name → `renamed`; value
  intentionally changed → `drift-fix`; brand-new token → `added`; no exact old
  equivalent, mapped to nearest → `mapped-nearest`.
- `recommendedSemantic` — optional semantic target for a raw/primitive usage, else
  `null`.

Do not guess values. Every `newValue` comes from a read of the DTCG source, not an
assumption (read discipline).

## Step 2 — Install the vetted scripts + wire `tokens:validate`

Copy these from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/` into the user's repo **verbatim**
(they are zero-dependency and version with the user's repo so their CI can run them):

- `lib/crosswalk.mjs` → `packages/tokens/scripts/lib/crosswalk.mjs`
- `lib/dtcg.mjs` → `packages/tokens/scripts/lib/dtcg.mjs` (required by
  `validate-crosswalk.mjs` — copying the validator without it breaks the gate at import)
- `lib/source-scan.mjs` → `packages/tokens/scripts/lib/source-scan.mjs` (required by
  `guard-token-removal.mjs` — copying the guard without it breaks it at import)
- `validate-crosswalk.mjs` → `packages/tokens/scripts/validate-crosswalk.mjs`
- `build-reverse-index.mjs` → `packages/tokens/scripts/build-reverse-index.mjs`
- `guard-token-removal.mjs` → `packages/tokens/scripts/guard-token-removal.mjs`
- `crosswalk.schema.json` → `packages/tokens/crosswalk.schema.json` (beside
  `crosswalk.json`, so the `$schema` pointer resolves)

Then add to `packages/tokens/package.json` `scripts` (don't clobber existing keys):

```jsonc
"tokens:validate": "node scripts/validate-crosswalk.mjs --crosswalk crosswalk.json --tokens dtcg/tokens.json",
"tokens:reverse-index": "node scripts/build-reverse-index.mjs --crosswalk crosswalk.json --out crosswalk.reverse.json"
```

See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/README.md` for the full install contract.

## Step 3 — Run the gate (must pass N/N)

Run `npm run tokens:validate` (from `packages/tokens/`). It must report **N/N** —
every row's resolved value matches its `newValue`. If it reports mismatches or
missing tokens, fix the crosswalk (or the token source) and re-run. **Never proceed
on a red validator and never edit a generated token file to make it pass** — change
the source in Figma and re-sync (guardrail 7). The validator is the source of truth
that the crosswalk and the real tokens agree.

## Step 4 — Generate the reverse index

Run `npm run tokens:reverse-index`. This writes `crosswalk.reverse.json`
(`codeToken → newToken`), which the code-retrofit phase uses to semi-automate the
SCSS/Tailwind swaps. If it reports conflicts (one old symbol mapping to two new
tokens), resolve them in the crosswalk before relying on the index.

## Step 5 — Update the manifest

Write the `tokenCrosswalk` section **only** (this skill owns it; never write another
skill's fields):

- `path` — the actual path written (`"packages/tokens/crosswalk.json"`).
- `statusCounts` — copy the camelCase object the validator printed
  (`{ aligned, renamed, driftFix, added, mappedNearest }`).
- `validatorPassing` — `true` once `tokens:validate` passes N/N.

Append `token-crosswalk-builder` to `completedSkills`.

## What this skill must NOT do

- Never delete old tokens or outputs here — that's the cleanup phase, gated by the
  token-removal guard returning zero references (safe sequence, guardrail 4).
- Never edit generated token files to make the validator pass — fix the source.
- Never write another skill's manifest fields (e.g. `tokens.intakeMode` is owned by
  `design-system-audit`).
- Never proceed past a red `tokens:validate`.
- Never assert a prerequisite is absent without a verified read (read discipline).
