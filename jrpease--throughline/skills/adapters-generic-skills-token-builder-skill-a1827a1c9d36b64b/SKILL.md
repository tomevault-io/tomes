# Token builder

> **Critical collection rule:** this system uses **one collection per category per tier** — never one giant `Primitives` + one giant `Semantic`. Color, spacing, typography, radius, and border each get their own primitive collection and their own semantic collection. This is non-negotiable: modes (Light/Dark, Desktop/Mobile) belong to a collection, so mixing categories in one collection forces unrelated variables to share the same mode axis.

> **Model tip (#3):** building a coherent token system (ramps, type scale, modes,
> primitive→semantic aliasing) is reasoning-heavy. It runs on your session model —
> Sonnet is a solid default; Opus helps for large or multi-mode systems. See the
> model guide in the ThroughLine README.

Creates a two-tier design token system as Figma variables. Each tier is split
into **one collection per category** (color, spacing, type, radius, border) so
every category owns its own modes — see Step 1 for why. Within a collection,
Figma variables are grouped with `/` and omit the category prefix (the
collection already carries it); the sync layer later derives the dotted logical
name (`color.gray.50`) by prefixing the collection's category.

- **Primitives** — raw values with no meaning attached: `gray/50`, `space/4`
  in their category's primitive collection. The full palette of possible values.
- **Semantic** — meaning-bearing tokens that **alias onto primitives**:
  `bg/default` → `{gray/50}`, `text/primary` → `{gray/900}`. This is the layer
  the rest of the system consumes.

The power of two tiers: change a primitive once and every semantic token
referencing it updates automatically, which cascades through sheets, components,
and synced code. Preserving these aliases (not flattening them) is what makes
runtime theming work later, so **always create semantic tokens as references to
primitives, never as copied literal values.**

## Prerequisites

This skill needs a live Figma connection. Read the manifest
(`.throughline/references/manifest-schema.md` for the schema) and check `figma.connected`.
Then do a cheap liveness read to confirm the connection is actually live right
now. If it isn't, say so plainly and offer to run the `figma-environment-setup`
skill first: "Figma isn't connected yet — want me to set that up? It's a
one-time thing." Don't proceed until Figma is reachable.

Use the write mechanism recorded in `figma.mechanism` (default `console-mcp`).
With Console MCP, prefer `figma_execute` to create variables in scripted loops
rather than one tool call per variable — this is dramatically more
token-efficient for the potentially hundreds of primitives across modes.

**Scripting via `figma_execute`:** see
`.throughline/references/figma-scripting.md` for the shared gotchas —
the single-bridge-instance preflight (concurrent writes corrupt the file), the
`dynamic-page` async APIs (synchronous document-wide getters like
`getLocalVariableCollections` **and** setters like `figma.currentPage =` /
`node.textStyleId =` throw — use `getLocalVariableCollectionsAsync`,
`setCurrentPageAsync`, `setTextStyleIdAsync`, …), the `resize()` axis-lock trap,
and why large `WRAP` grids time out. For a simple verification read, prefer the
dedicated `figma_get_variables` tool (it handles dynamic-page correctly and
resolves aliases with `resolveAliases: true`) over a hand-written script.

**Execution model — sequential architect → figma-executor with model routing.**
If your host supports subagent dispatch, plan the token architecture once with
one **architect** dispatch (deep tier) — it reads existing Figma state and emits
a transcription-grade spec in stable identifiers (collection/variable *names*,
never nodeIds) — then build the variables with **figma-executor** dispatches
(balanced tier), strictly sequentially: preflight `figma_get_status` and never
run two Figma-touching subagents at once (the single bridge is concurrency-1).
Each executor finalizes by build-verify-then-replace with a programmatic
read-back (`figma_get_variables`, not a screenshot); gate the result with a
**reviewer** pass. **Keep the human checkpoint between tiers** (the PAUSE in
Steps 2–4) — subagents run continuously within a tier, but you pause for the
human between them. Route per
`.throughline/references/agent-routing.md`; never parallelize Figma
work. If your host has no subagent dispatch, build and verify each tier inline,
sequentially, as the steps below describe.

## Step 1 — Brainstorm the structure (before building anything)

Run the protocol in `.throughline/references/brainstorm-before-build.md`. **First establish
the intake mode** (generative / descriptive / import) per that reference — it
changes how much you generate versus preserve. **In import mode, do not stop at a
1:1 transcription of what the user fed you** (a brand guide or marketing site is
almost always a partial system): after preserving and organizing their values,
run the **completeness pass** from that reference — diff against the full-system
model and proactively propose the missing pieces (tonal ramps, neutral ramp,
state colors, dark mode, semantic roles, elevation/radius scales) as a
preserve-first, opt-in menu derived from their existing values. Then lock the
structure with the user, in readable chunks:

- **Seeds and direction** — capture what the user actually has: brand color(s),
  font(s), aesthetic words (modern, rounded, dense, comfortable), reference
  images/URLs, or an existing token set to import. In generative mode, this is
  the seed you expand from; in import mode, this is the set you organize.
- **Color ramps** — which hues (e.g. gray, brand primary, success, warning,
  danger), and how many steps each (a 50–900 ramp of ~10 steps is a sensible
  default). In generative mode, derive a full tonal ramp and harmonized
  supporting families from the user's seed color(s).
- **Modes** — does the system need light + dark? Brand variants? Density? This
  is high-impact and shapes everything downstream (it determines how many values
  each variable holds and how the sync layer emits themes), so brainstorm it
  carefully. Default: light + dark.
- **Spacing scale** — base unit and steps (e.g. 4px base: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8,
  12, 16, 24...). Default to a 4px-based scale; "dense" pulls it tighter,
  "comfortable" looser.
- **Type scale** — font families, the size ramp, weights, line-heights. In
  generative mode, propose complementary font pairings from the user's seed
  font. Default to a modular scale.
- **Radius / border / shadow** scales as needed. "Rounded" → larger radius
  scale.
- **Primitive naming convention** — the single most important decision, because
  the semantic tier aliases onto these names and renaming later breaks every
  alias. Lock it explicitly. In Figma, name variables **without the category
  prefix** (the collection supplies it) and group with `/`: e.g. `gray/50`,
  `space/4`, `radius/md` inside their category's primitive collection. The sync
  layer derives the dotted logical identity (e.g. `color.gray.50`) by prefixing
  the collection's category. Keep names **neutral and semantic — never
  framework-specific** (don't name a token `--background` to match shadcn; the
  adapter renames per framework later). Figma is framework-agnostic; the adapter
  absorbs all framework-specific shaping.
- **Tiers** — default to **two-tier** (primitive + semantic). Only raise the
  option of a third **component** tier if the user signals multi-brand,
  white-labeling, or a very large/robust component library — for a single-brand
  project it adds complexity without payoff, so don't even surface it. If the
  user opts in, component tokens alias onto semantic tokens (e.g.
  `bg/primary` → `{bg/emphasis}`).
- **Collection structure** — two *tiers*, but **one collection per category per
  tier**, never one giant `Primitives` + one giant `Semantic`. In Figma a mode
  axis (Light/Dark, Desktop/Mobile, Brand) belongs to the *collection*, so every
  variable in a collection is forced to share its modes. Putting `space` in the
  same collection as `color` drags spacing into Light/Dark, which is meaningless.
  Default layout (single-brand): private primitive collections `_Color/Primitive`,
  `_Typography/Primitive`, `_Radius/Primitive`, `_Border/Primitive`, and a
  **public** `Spacing/Primitive`; published semantic collections `Color/Semantic`
  (Light/Dark), `Spacing/Semantic`, `Typography/Semantic`, `Radius/Semantic`,
  `Border/Semantic`. Privacy is the leading-`_` prefix. `size/icon/*` lives in
  `Spacing/Primitive`; don't create a `Sizing` collection unless control
  heights/avatars become real tokens.
- **Multi-brand** — keep two axes in two collections so they don't multiply.
  Brand lives on `_Color/Primitive` (modes = Brand A, Brand B = raw palettes);
  Theme lives on `Color/Semantic` (modes = Light, Dark). A frame sets both
  independently and Figma resolves `bg/default`(Light) → `{gray/50}` → Brand A's
  gray. This keeps each collection ≤2 modes — under the Figma **Professional cap
  of 4 modes/collection**. (Brand-on-primitive assumes brands differ in raw
  palette, same role mapping; if a brand needs a *different* mapping, it also
  becomes a mode on `Color/Semantic`.)

Show the proposed full structure back to the user and get sign-off before
creating anything.

### The structural-consistency rule (prevents the "different every time" problem)

Every token concern gets **both** a primitive and a semantic collection, even
when the semantic tier is a 1:1 passthrough today. A dimensional semantic tier
(`Spacing/Semantic`, `Radius/Semantic`, `Border/Semantic`) is justified by a
**plausible future mode axis** — e.g. adding Desktop/Mobile to spacing later —
which only works if the semantic collection already exists to carry that axis.
Building every concern the same way is also what makes the output consistent
run-to-run instead of an arbitrary guess about which categories to duplicate.

The one guardrail: **consistency does not license invented roles.** Semantic
names must be real usage roles (`inset/md`, `width/focus`, `text/primary`),
never just renamed primitive steps (`space/12`, `width/1`). A passthrough role
with a meaningful name is fine; a fake role nobody applies is not. If you can't
name a genuine role for a category, give it semantic roles that map to actual
usage rather than mirroring the primitive scale step-for-step.

## Step 1.5 — Brownfield: refine existing variables in place (don't rebuild)

If this is a **retrofit** (`tokens.intakeMode: "retrofit"`, or the file already has
variables), do **not** create a fresh set on top of the old one. Refine what exists,
in place. **Read `.throughline/references/brownfield-retrofit.md` first** —
guardrail 3 is the whole point of this branch.

**The hard rule (guardrail 3):** rename and realign variables **in place** to preserve
their Figma IDs. **Never delete-and-recreate** — every binding (a populated file can
have thousands) references the variable *id*, so recreating under the same name still
unbinds everything. A rename keeps the id; a delete+create does not.

**The refine loop:**

1. **Read what exists** (read discipline). Use `figma_get_variables` after
   `await figma.loadAllPagesAsync()`. List the existing collections, variables, and
   values. Treat a `0`/empty first read as suspect — re-read before concluding the file
   is empty.
2. **Snapshot bindings before.** Run the binding-survival audit in
   `.throughline/references/figma-scripting.md` to record the total consuming
   binding count *before* any change. This is your guardrail-3 tripwire.
3. **Rename / realign in place.** Use the rename operation that keeps the id (e.g.
   `figma_rename_variable` / setting `variable.name`), and update values in place. Map
   old names to the new two-tier scheme; record each old→new mapping (the crosswalk
   consumes it later via `token-crosswalk-builder`).
4. **Snapshot bindings after, and assert equality.** Re-run the binding-survival audit.
   The total **must be unchanged**. A drop means a binding was severed — STOP, find the
   delete-and-recreate that slipped in, and restore from the baseline.
5. **Add genuinely-new variables** (the `added` rows) as normal creates — only the
   *existing* ones must be renamed rather than recreated.

After the refine loop, continue with the normal tiers below for any net-new structure,
but **skip recreating anything that already exists**. The primitive/semantic checkpoint
(Step 2's PAUSE) still applies: lock names before building dependent semantics.

## Step 2 — Build the PRIMITIVE tier, then PAUSE

Create the **per-category primitive collections** and their variables via a
scripted loop on the active write mechanism. Default set:

- `_Color/Primitive` — color ramps (`gray/50…900`, `brand/50…900`,
  `success`/`warning`/`danger`, `white`, `black`).
- `Spacing/Primitive` — the spacing scale (`space/0,2,4,8,12,16,24,32,48,64`)
  **plus** `size/icon/{sm,md,lg}`.
- `_Typography/Primitive` — `family/*`, `size/*`, `weight/*`, `lineHeight/*`,
  `letterSpacing/*`.
- `_Radius/Primitive` — `radius/{none,sm,md,lg,xl,full}`.
- `_Border/Primitive` — `width/{0,1,2,4}`. **Do not skip border width** — borders
  need a width primitive, not only a color.

**Privacy:** the leading-`_` prefix hides a collection from the published
library. Keep color/type/radius/border primitives private (they're always
consumed through semantics or styles). Make **`Spacing/Primitive` public** (no
underscore) — spacing semantics are intentionally minimal, so designers will grab
raw `space/*` for one-off gaps. Note the trade-off in your checkpoint summary: a
value applied directly from `Spacing/Primitive` is *frozen across device modes*;
only `Spacing/Semantic` carries future Desktop/Mobile responsiveness.

**Modes at the primitive tier:** primitives are usually mode-free (a single
*Value* mode). The exception is multi-brand: give `_Color/Primitive` a Brand mode
axis (Brand A, Brand B) holding each brand's raw palette. All other primitive
collections stay single-mode.

Then **stop and checkpoint.** This is the critical seam: semantic tokens are
about to alias onto these primitives, so the primitive names and values must be
right *before* you build on them. Show the user the created collections —
summarize the ramps and scales, note which are public vs private, and if helpful
mention the token-sheet-builder skill can render them visually later. Ask for
explicit confirmation: "Here are your primitives. Once you're happy, I'll build
the semantic layer on top — and after that, renaming primitives gets disruptive,
so this is the moment to adjust names or values."

Update the manifest: `tokens.primitivesBuilt` = `true`, add every created
collection name to `tokens.collections`.

Do not proceed to the semantic tier until the user confirms.

## Step 3 — Build the SEMANTIC tier as aliases

Create the **per-category semantic collections**, where every variable
**references a primitive**, not a literal value. Bind each semantic variable to
its primitive so the alias is live. Default set and modes:

- `Color/Semantic` — modes **Light, Dark** (+ a Brand mode only if a brand needs
  a different *mapping*, not just a different palette). Roles: `bg/{default,
  subtle,muted,emphasis,inverse}`, `text/{primary,secondary,disabled,inverse,
  link,onEmphasis}`, `border/{default,subtle,focus,emphasis}`,
  `status/{success,warning,danger}/{bg,text,border}`,
  `shadow/{ambient,key}`. The **`shadow/*`** roles are the colors the elevation
  effect styles consume (Step 4) — they carry alpha and are **mode-aware**: a
  low-alpha near-black in Light, and a darker/higher-alpha value in Dark, so
  toggling modes recolors every elevation. They live here in `Color/Semantic`
  (rather than as part of the effect style) precisely so the Light/Dark switch
  reaches them; alias a near-black primitive where the alpha allows, otherwise
  set the rgba per mode directly. **`text/onEmphasis`** is the
  label/icon color that sits **on** `bg/emphasis` (a primary button's text, a
  filled badge) — it must contrast with the emphasis fill in *every* mode, so it's
  a distinct role, **not** `text/inverse` (which flips with the theme and won't
  reliably contrast a brand-colored emphasis fill). Component-builder binds primary/
  filled control labels to this role; without it, builds fall back to literals and
  break the "everything bound" audit.
- `Spacing/Semantic` — single *Default* mode now, structured so Desktop/Mobile
  can be added later. Roles: `inset/{xs,sm,md,lg,xl}`, `stack/*`, `inline/*`.
- `Typography/Semantic` — single *Default* mode (room for Desktop/Mobile). Roles:
  `size/{body,bodyLg,heading/sm…xl,caption}` and role line-heights; these feed
  the text styles built in Step 4.
- `Radius/Semantic` — single mode. Roles: `control`, `card`, `pill`, `field`.
- `Border/Semantic` — single mode. Roles: `width/{default,focus,emphasis}`
  aliasing `_Border/Primitive` widths, plus **`offset/focus`** (the gap between a
  control's edge and its focus ring, the `outline-offset` equivalent) aliasing the
  `2` width primitive. It's used by the **outline-style** focus recipe (e.g.
  `vanilla-css`) to keep the ring clear of the edge for accessibility; library idioms
  that render focus as a spread-shadow ring don't need it — see "State handling" in the
  component standards for the per-library recipes.
- `Opacity/Semantic` (when the system needs disabled/overlay states) — single
  mode. Roles: `disabled`, `muted`, `overlay/scrim`, `hover`, aliasing
  `_Opacity/Primitive`. See the **opacity scale rule** below — this is the one
  category where the Figma value scale is a trap.

> **⚠️ Opacity is stored 0–100, NOT 0–1 (critical).** When a variable is bound to
> a node's **`opacity`** field, Figma treats the value as a **0–100 percentage and
> divides by 100**. So an opacity primitive must be created on the **0–100 scale**:
> `_Opacity/Primitive` `40` has the value **`40`** (which renders as 0.4), never
> `0.4` (which would render as 0.004 — effectively invisible). Name and value must
> match (`40` = `40`), and a bound `disabled`/`overlay` element renders correctly.
> The sync layer is responsible for the inverse: CSS `opacity` is 0–1, so it
> **÷100 on emit** — token-builder and token-sync-layer are a **matched pair** here.

These dimensional semantic tiers are often passthroughs today — that's expected
under the structural-consistency rule; keep the role names real (`inset/md`, not
`space/16`).

The **color** semantic tier is where the Light/Dark switch lives:
`bg/default` → `{gray/50}` in Light and `{gray/900}` in Dark. Primitives
stay fixed; the semantic aliases differ per mode. This is exactly what lets the
sync layer emit `:root`/`.dark` for web later.

**Mode-application reality (state this to the user):** a frame can now carry up
to three independent modes — Brand (`_Color/Primitive`), Theme (`Color/Semantic`),
and later Device (`Spacing`/`Typography`). That's the cost of independent axes.

Verify the aliases resolve — use `figma_get_variables` (filtered to the new
semantic collection, `resolveAliases: true`) to confirm semantic tokens point at
primitives, not literals; if you read via a `figma_execute` script instead, use
the async APIs (see the dynamic-page note in Prerequisites).

**Then assert contrast, before the checkpoint.** Using that same
`figma_get_variables` read (filtered to `Color/Semantic`, `resolveAliases: true`),
convert Figma's 0–1 RGBA channels to hex and **run the shipped module rather than
doing the arithmetic in the transcript**: shape the per-mode values as
`[{ mode, values: { "<dotted token path>": "#rrggbb" } }]` and pass them to a
single `node` invocation that imports `CONTRAST_PAIRS`, `contrastRatio`,
`composite` and `AA_NORMAL_TEXT` from
`.throughline/scripts/lib/contrast.mjs` and prints one line per pair per
mode:

    node --input-type=module -e "<import the module, read the JSON from
    process.argv[1], loop CONTRAST_PAIRS × modes, print mode/fg/bg/ratio>" '<the JSON>'

The module ships precisely so the maths has one home: read the table and call the
function, and restate neither. The pairs are the semantic roles the system
already promises (`text/onEmphasis` on `bg/emphasis`, `text/primary` on
`bg/default`, each status text on its own status background); a role this system
does not have is not asserted.

**The keys are dotted token paths, not Figma variable names.** Figma calls the
role `text/onEmphasis` in the `Color/Semantic` collection; `CONTRAST_PAIRS`
spells it `color.text.onEmphasis`, and no normalized fold bridges the two —
`colorsemantictextonemphasis` is not `colortextonemphasis`. Apply the **Name
mapping** rule the sync already defines
(`.throughline/skills/token-sync-layer/SKILL.md`): the category drives
the top-level group and the tier is dropped, so `Color/Semantic` +
`text/onEmphasis` → `color.text.onEmphasis`. Both halves of this check have to
agree on the spelling, or the Figma-time half asserts pairs the CLI half never
sees, and the two never disagree because they never meet.

**A failing pair stops the tier.** Do not proceed to the checkpoint or to Step 4
with a pair below 4.5:1. Report it in guide voice
(`.throughline/references/guide-voice.md`): name the two roles, the
mode, the measured ratio and the required one, then give **one** recommended fix
— re-point that mode's alias at a primitive with more separation, naming a
specific step in the ramp that clears — rather than a menu of options. This is
the "modes can't be built with poor colour contrast" promise, and it is the
cheapest place in the whole system to catch it: the mode is being defined right
now, and nothing is built on it yet.

**If the user explicitly accepts a failing pair**, continue, and say plainly in
the same breath what it costs downstream — describing the mechanism that actually
exists, not a registration that cannot reach the sync:

1. The acceptance is recorded in this stage's entry (`contrast-baseline` at
   `result: "fail"`, `advancedBecause` naming it, and the pair itself listed in
   `accepted`), and `token-sync-layer` subtracts exactly that pair from its own
   gate run — so **the next token sync is not blocked** by it, while any *other*
   failing pair, including one introduced later, still stops the sync.
2. The repo's own registered `verify:check` — the one
   `storybook-chromatic-builder` wires into CI later — derives the same ratio off
   the DTCG source and would fail there. That skill runs the gate itself when it
   wires the script, and if every failure it sees is a pair recorded here as
   accepted, it registers the script with `--skip color-contrast` and says so at
   the time; if the pair has since been fixed, it registers the script without the
   flag. Nothing is owed to a script that does not exist yet, and nothing is
   switched off on the strength of a record alone.

Say both, in that order, and then say how each one ends, because they do not end
the same way. Fixing the pair in Figma **retires the sync's side by itself**: the
failure stops appearing, the recorded triple matches nothing, and the sync goes
back to normal on its own — with one expected line on that first sync, where the
previously recorded `fail` disagrees with a rerun that now passes. That line does
not stop anything, and the same run re-records the pass. The registered
`--skip color-contrast` does **not** heal: it is a line in the repo's
`package.json` and stays until someone removes it, which is the one thing this
override leaves behind. Say that plainly rather than letting them find it — a
user who fixes the pair months later and still sees contrast skipped in CI has
been told the gate is live when it is not. Say the scope too: `--skip` is
rule-wide, so while that flag is registered CI checks **no** pair, including one
introduced after the acceptance. The sync is what catches that one, since every
token change goes through it — but the user should know CI is not the thing
standing guard meanwhile.

Then checkpoint: show the semantic layer and demonstrate the cascade if useful
("change `gray/50` and `bg/default` follows").

Update the manifest: `tokens.semanticBuilt` = `true`, add every semantic
collection to `tokens.collections`.

## Step 4 — Build Figma STYLES (the third phase)

Figma variables can't express everything a design system needs. Composed
**styles** must be created as a distinct phase *after* the variables exist, so
they can **bind to the tokens you just built** rather than duplicating values:

- **Text styles** — a full type scale needs one text style per role/size
  (e.g. `Heading/XL`, `Body/Default`, `Caption`), each composing family + size +
  weight + line-height + letter-spacing. Bind size and family to the
  corresponding `font.*` variables where Figma supports it, so changing a font
  primitive updates the text styles. A type scale is NOT just variables — these
  composed text styles are what designers actually apply to text layers.
- **Effect styles** — drop shadows and elevation levels (e.g. `Elevation/1`
  through `Elevation/5`), driven by the shadow scale from the brainstorm. The
  *composition* (offset, blur, spread) is what makes this a style rather than a
  variable — but the shadow **color must be bound to the `shadow/*`
  `Color/Semantic` variables**, never hardcoded. Figma supports binding the color
  of a drop shadow inside an effect style to a color variable; do that for every
  shadow in every elevation level. This is what makes elevations **mode-aware**:
  because the bound `shadow/*` variable carries different values per mode, toggling
  Light/Dark recolors all elevations automatically. A style with a literal shadow
  color is the bug — it stays the same color in dark mode. (Heavier elevations may
  layer two shadows, e.g. an ambient + a key shadow; bind each to `shadow/ambient`
  and `shadow/key` respectively.)
- **Grid styles** — layout grids if the user wants them (column/row grids for
  their breakpoints). Optional; only if requested.

Generate styles via the active write mechanism (scripted where possible). Bind
to variables wherever Figma allows so styles consume tokens rather than
duplicating them. Checkpoint with the user: show the created styles.

Update the manifest: set `tokens.stylesBuilt` = `true` and record which style
groups were created in `tokens.styleGroups`. Append `token-builder` to
`completedSkills`.

**Record the stage entry:** `node .throughline/scripts/verify-check.mjs
--record --stage token-builder --entry <tmp>.json` (subject defaults to
`"system"`; this stage is not per-component). Build `<tmp>.json` with `changed`
summarizing the collections and modes created, the attested check
`contrast-baseline` carrying `result` and a one-line `evidence` naming the
tightest ratio per mode (`"Light 5.2:1, Dark 4.9:1 — tightest is
text/onEmphasis on bg/emphasis"`), and `advancedBecause`.

When the user accepted a failing pair, the check's `result` is `"fail"`,
`advancedBecause` names the acceptance, and the check carries
`accepted: [{ fg, bg, mode }]` — one entry per accepted pair, `fg` and `bg` as the
dotted token paths `CONTRAST_PAIRS` uses, and `mode` as **the Figma mode name this
skill just read** (`Light`, `Dark` — the names in the collection it built), not a
file name. At this point in the pipeline no DTCG file exists to name a mode
after: the sync writes those later and chooses their names, so a filename here
would be a guess that never matches. The sync translates this name into its own
file label before matching, and recording what was actually observed is what
makes that translation possible. **Write the pair structurally as well as in
prose** — `advancedBecause` is for whoever reads the bundle later, and `accepted`
is what `token-sync-layer` matches against, so an acceptance recorded only in
prose would stop the next sync exactly as if it had never been given. Accept only
the pairs the user actually accepted; that list is the scope of the override.

The entry shape is `.throughline/references/proof-bundle.md` — do not
restate it here. Write the entry only when the tier actually completed: a run that
stopped on a failing pair and was not resumed records nothing, the same rule
`component-builder` follows for a `BLOCKED` component.

## Step 5 — Hand off

Tell the user what's unlocked and offer natural next steps without forcing them:
generate a visual stylesheet of all tokens (token-sheet-builder), build an icon
system (icon-system-builder), or start on components (component-builder). If
they're heading toward code, mention that the token-sync skill will later turn
these exact variables into code files — but only when they have a repo, which
comes later.

## Notes that matter

- **Never flatten semantic into literals.** Aliases are the whole point.
- **One collection per category per tier.** Modes belong to the collection, so
  splitting by category is what keeps color's Light/Dark from infecting spacing.
- **Privacy is the `_` prefix.** Only `Spacing/Primitive` is public by default;
  all other primitives are private.
- **Primitives can be multi-mode.** Brand lives on `_Color/Primitive`; the sync
  layer must emit brand themes from the primitive tier, not just light/dark from
  semantics.
- **Lock primitive names before building semantics.** The checkpoint between
  tiers exists precisely to prevent rename cascades.
- **Think in DTCG terms even though you're writing Figma variables.** Each token
  has a value and a type (color, dimension, fontFamily, etc.). The sync layer
  will later normalize these Figma variables into DTCG-format JSON, so keep
  types clean and consistent — it makes the downstream sync trivial.
- **Token-efficiency:** scripted loops via `figma_execute`, batched per tier —
  not per-variable tool calls.
- **Brownfield: never delete-and-recreate to rename (guardrail 3).** On a retrofit,
  rename variables in place to preserve their Figma IDs and every binding. Snapshot the
  binding count before and after each rename and assert it's unchanged — see Step 1.5
