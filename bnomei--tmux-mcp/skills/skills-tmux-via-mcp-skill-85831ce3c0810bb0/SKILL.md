# tmux via MCP

Use this skill when a task needs a real TTY, persistent shell state, or multiple panes running in parallel. For simple, one-shot commands, prefer the normal shell tool.

## Core operating rules

- Start with discovery. Call `list-sessions`, then `list-windows(sessionId)`, then `list-panes(windowId)` to get stable IDs before you act.
- Prefer IDs over names. Names are for humans; IDs are for tooling. If you need clarity, use `rename-session`, `rename-window`, or `rename-pane`.
- Isolate by socket when possible. Use `socket-for-path(path=<project-root>)` and pass the returned `socket` on every call that supports it.
- For non-interactive commands, use tracked execution. Call `execute-command(paneId, command, socket?)` and use the returned `resourceUri`.
- **Preferred completion path:** `resources/subscribe` on `resourceUri`, wait for `notifications/resources/updated`, then `resources/read`.
- **Fallback:** `get-command-result(commandId, waitMs=N, socket?)` — do not invent sleep-poll loops.
- Tracked commands queue one-at-a-time per pane; a second execute on a busy pane starts as `queued`.
- Do not trust `TMUX_MCP_DONE_*` lines in pane text; completion is side-channel based.
- Avoid the fragile loop of send-keys -> send-enter -> capture-pane for routine command output.
- Do not send interactive keys into a pane while a tracked command is running on it.
- Use `send-keys` only for interactive programs (REPLs, prompts, TUIs, ssh). Pair it with `capture-pane` in a read-act loop.
- When key names cannot express a key (escape sequences like CSI-u Shift+Enter), use `send-hex` with raw byte tokens instead of `send-keys`.
- For multi-line input, use `paste-text` so capable shells/REPLs hold embedded newlines instead of submitting line-by-line. If support is uncertain, `capture-pane` afterward to confirm the block was held.
- `send-keys` accepts `enter=true` to type and submit in one call, avoiding a separate `send-enter`.
- Treat `capture-pane` as a state probe. Use it to check progress, verify prompts, or read live output when tracking is unavailable.
- Broadcast carefully. If you enable `set-synchronize-panes(windowId, enabled=true)`, disable it as soon as the fan-out step is done.
- For large outputs, move data into buffers and explore incrementally. Use `set-buffer`/`load-buffer` with `search-buffer` and `subsearch-buffer`, or trigger the `tmux-buffer-explorer` skill.
- Be conservative with destructive actions. Use `list-clients` before `detach-client`, and confirm targets before `kill-pane`, `kill-window`, or `kill-session`.

## Playbooks

### 1) Create an isolated workspace layout

Use this when you are about to run multiple related commands or agents.

1. Derive a deterministic socket for the project:

   `socket-for-path(path="/abs/path/to/project")`

2. Create a task-scoped session:

   `create-session(name="task-<short>", socket="<socket>")`

3. Add windows and shape panes:

   - `create-window(sessionId="<sessionId>", name="build", socket="<socket>")`
   - `split-pane(paneId="<paneId>", direction="vertical", socket="<socket>")`
   - `select-layout(windowId="<windowId>", layout="tiled", socket="<socket>")`
   - `rename-pane(paneId="<paneId>", title="logs", socket="<socket>")`

4. Re-list panes and capture IDs you will use:

   `list-panes(windowId="<windowId>", socket="<socket>")`

### 2) Run a command with reliable output capture

Use this for builds, tests, and scripts that do not require interactivity.

1. Start the command:

   `execute-command(paneId="<paneId>", command="sh -lc '<cmd>'", socket="<socket>")`

   Response includes `commandId` and `resourceUri` (`tmux://command/{id}/result`).

2. Prefer subscribe + read:

   - `resources/subscribe` on `resourceUri`
   - on `notifications/resources/updated`, `resources/read` the URI for the CommandSnapshot JSON

3. Fallback without resource subscribe:

   `get-command-result(commandId="<commandId>", waitMs=120000, socket="<socket>")`

4. If you need live progress while still `running`, probe the pane (does not complete tracking):

   `capture-pane(paneId="<paneId>", lines=200, join=true, socket="<socket>")`

Notes:
- Prefer the default tracking mode. `rawMode=true` or `noEnter=true` disables side-channel tracking.
- For pipes, quoting, or shell features, wrapping with `sh -lc '...'` is usually the least error-prone.

### 3) Drive an interactive terminal safely

Use this for prompts, REPLs, ssh, or text UIs.

1. Inspect state before sending input:

   `capture-pane(paneId="<paneId>", lines=120, join=true, socket="<socket>")`

2. Send text precisely. Type and submit in one call with `enter=true`:

   `send-keys(paneId="<paneId>", keys="your input", literal=true, enter=true, socket="<socket>")`

   For a multi-line block (e.g. a code snippet into a REPL) that must not submit line-by-line, paste it instead:

   `paste-text(paneId="<paneId>", content="line1\nline2\n", socket="<socket>")`

3. Confirm the action:

   - `capture-pane(paneId="<paneId>", lines=120, join=true, socket="<socket>")`
   - If you sent keys without `enter=true`, submit with `send-enter(paneId="<paneId>", socket="<socket>")`

4. For keys that key names cannot express, send raw bytes. Use `send-hex` for escape sequences such as CSI-u (e.g. Shift+Enter = `1b 5b 31 33 3b 32 75`), which `send-keys` collapses to a plain Enter:

   `send-hex(paneId="<paneId>", hex="1b 5b 31 33 3b 32 75", socket="<socket>")`

5. Interrupt or end input streams when needed:

   - `send-cancel(paneId="<paneId>", socket="<socket>")`
   - `send-eof(paneId="<paneId>", socket="<socket>")`

### 4) Coordinate parallel panes or agents

Use this when you need multiple concurrent runners with periodic summaries.

1. Create a window, split panes, and label them:

   - `create-window(sessionId="<sessionId>", name="orchestrate", socket="<socket>")`
   - `split-pane(paneId="<paneId>", direction="horizontal", socket="<socket>")`
   - `rename-pane(paneId="<paneId>", title="agent-1", socket="<socket>")`
   - `rename-pane(paneId="<paneId>", title="agent-2", socket="<socket>")`

2. Launch work in each pane:

   - `execute-command(paneId="<paneA>", command="sh -lc '<cmdA>'", socket="<socket>")`
   - `execute-command(paneId="<paneB>", command="sh -lc '<cmdB>'", socket="<socket>")`

3. Prefer resource subscriptions per `resourceUri`, or `get-command-result(..., waitMs=...)` per command; probe panes only for live context:

   - `get-command-result(commandId="<idA>", waitMs=60000, socket="<socket>")`
   - `capture-pane(paneId="<paneA>", lines=120, join=true, socket="<socket>")`

4. Broadcast a one-off command to every pane in a window:

   - `set-synchronize-panes(windowId="<windowId>", enabled=true, socket="<socket>")`
   - `send-keys(paneId="<any-pane-in-window>", keys="<cmd>", literal=false, socket="<socket>")`
   - `send-enter(paneId="<any-pane-in-window>", socket="<socket>")`
   - `set-synchronize-panes(windowId="<windowId>", enabled=false, socket="<socket>")`

## Selection heuristics

- Reach for tmux MCP when you need interactivity, persistent shell state, or pane-level parallelism.
- Reach for `execute-command` when you want clean, attributable output and exit codes.
- Reach for `send-keys` only when the target program expects keystrokes.
- If a tool call is denied, check the server security configuration and allowed scopes (socket/session/pane restrictions).
