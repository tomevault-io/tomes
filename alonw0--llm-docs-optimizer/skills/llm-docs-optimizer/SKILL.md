# LLM Docs Optimizer

This skill optimizes project documentation and README files for AI coding assistants and LLMs like Claude, GitHub Copilot, and others. It improves documentation quality through multiple approaches: c7score optimization (Context7's quality benchmark), llms.txt file generation for LLM navigation, question-driven content restructuring, and automated quality scoring across 5 key metrics.

**Version:** 1.3.0

## Understanding C7Score

C7score evaluates documentation using 5 metrics across two categories:

**LLM Analysis (85% of score):**
1. **Question-Snippet Comparison (80%)**: How well snippets answer common developer questions
2. **LLM Evaluation (5%)**: Relevancy, clarity, correctness, and uniqueness

**Text Analysis (15% of score):**
3. **Formatting (5%)**: Proper structure and language tags
4. **Project Metadata (5%)**: Absence of irrelevant content
5. **Initialization (5%)**: Not just imports/installations

For detailed information on each metric, read `references/c7score_metrics.md`.

## Core Workflow

### Step 0: Ask About llms.txt Generation (C7Score Optimization Only)

**IMPORTANT**: When the user requests c7score documentation optimization, ALWAYS ask if they also want an llms.txt file:

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool with this question:

```
Question: "Would you also like me to generate an llms.txt file for your project?"
Header: "llms.txt"
Options:
  - "Yes, create both optimized docs and llms.txt"
    Description: "Optimize documentation for c7score AND generate an llms.txt navigation file"
  - "No, just optimize the documentation"
    Description: "Only perform c7score optimization without llms.txt generation"
```

**If user chooses "Yes"**:
- Proceed with c7score optimization workflow (Steps 1-5)
- Then follow the llms.txt generation workflow
- Provide both optimized documentation AND llms.txt file

**If user chooses "No"**:
- Proceed with c7score optimization workflow only (Steps 1-5)

**Note**: If the user explicitly requests ONLY llms.txt generation (no c7score mention), skip this step and go directly to the llms.txt generation workflow.

### Step 1: Analyze Current Documentation

When given a project or documentation to optimize:

1. **Read the documentation files** (README.md, docs/*.md, etc.)
2. **Run the analysis script** (optional but recommended) to identify issues:
   ```bash
   python scripts/analyze_docs.py <path-to-readme.md>
   ```
   Note: The script requires Python 3.7+ and is optional. You can skip it if Python is unavailable.
3. **Review the analysis report** (if script was run) to understand current state:
   - Count of code snippets with issues
   - Breakdown by metric type
   - Duplicate snippets
   - Language distribution

### Step 2: Generate Developer Questions

Create a list of 15-20 questions that developers commonly ask about the project:

- Focus on "How do I..." questions
- Cover setup, configuration, basic usage, common operations
- Include authentication, error handling, advanced features
- Think about real-world use cases

**Example questions:**
- How do I install and set up [project]?
- How do I authenticate/configure [project]?
- How do I [main feature/operation]?
- How do I handle errors?
- How do I integrate with [common tools]?

### Step 3: Map Questions to Snippets

Evaluate which questions are well-answered by existing documentation:
- ✅ Questions with complete, working code examples
- ⚠️ Questions with partial or theoretical answers
- ❌ Questions with no answers

Prioritize filling gaps for unanswered questions.

### Step 4: Optimize Documentation

Apply optimizations based on priority:

**Priority 1: Question Coverage (80% of score)**
- Add complete code examples for unanswered questions
- Transform API references into usage examples
- Ensure each major snippet answers at least one common question
- Make examples self-contained and runnable

**Priority 2: Remove Duplicates**
- Identify similar or identical snippets
- Consolidate into comprehensive examples
- Ensure each snippet provides unique value

**Priority 3: Fix Formatting**
- Use proper language tags (python, javascript, typescript, bash, etc.)
- Follow TITLE / DESCRIPTION / CODE structure
- Avoid very short (<3 lines) or very long (>100 lines) snippets
- Don't use descriptive strings as language tags

**Priority 4: Remove Metadata**
- Remove or minimize licensing snippets
- Remove directory structure listings
- Remove citations and BibTeX entries
- Keep only usage-relevant content

**Priority 5: Enhance Initialization Snippets**
- Combine import-only snippets with usage examples
- Add context to installation commands
- Always show what comes after setup

For detailed transformation patterns, read `references/optimization_patterns.md`.

### Step 5: Validate Optimizations

Before finalizing, verify each optimized snippet:

✅ Can run standalone (copy-paste works)
✅ Answers a specific developer question
✅ Provides unique information
✅ Uses proper format and language tag
✅ Focuses on practical usage
✅ Includes necessary imports/setup
✅ No licensing, citations, or directory trees
✅ Syntactically correct code

### Step 6: Evaluate C7Score Impact

After optimization, provide a c7score evaluation comparing the original and optimized documentation:

**Evaluation Process:**

1. **Analyze Original Documentation** against c7score metrics:
   - Question-Snippet Matching (80%): How well do code examples answer developer questions?
   - LLM Evaluation (10%): Clarity, correctness, unique information
   - Formatting (5%): Proper markdown structure and language tags
   - Metadata Removal (2.5%): Absence of licenses, citations, directory trees
   - Initialization (2.5%): More than just imports/installation

2. **Analyze Optimized Documentation** using the same metrics

3. **Calculate Scores** (0-100 for each metric):
   - For Question-Snippet Matching:
     - 90-100: Excellent - Complete, practical answers with context
     - 70-89: Good - Most questions answered with working examples
     - 50-69: Fair - Partial answers, missing context
     - 30-49: Poor - Vague or incomplete answers
     - 0-29: Very Poor - Questions not addressed

   - For LLM Evaluation:
     - 90-100: Unique, clear, syntactically perfect
     - 70-89: Mostly unique and clear, minor issues
     - 50-69: Some duplicates or clarity issues
     - 30-49: Significant duplicates or syntax errors
     - 0-29: Major quality problems

   - For Formatting:
     - 100: All snippets properly formatted with language tags
     - 80-99: Minor formatting issues
     - 50-79: Multiple formatting problems
     - 0-49: Significant formatting issues

   - For Metadata Removal:
     - 100: No project metadata
     - 50-99: Some metadata present
     - 0-49: Significant metadata content

   - For Initialization:
     - 100: All examples show usage beyond setup
     - 50-99: Some initialization-only snippets
     - 0-49: Many initialization-only snippets

4. **Present Results** in this format:

```markdown
## C7Score Evaluation

### Original Documentation Score: XX/100

**Metric Breakdown:**
- Question-Snippet Matching: XX/100 (weight: 80%)
  - Analysis: [Brief explanation of score]
- LLM Evaluation: XX/100 (weight: 10%)
  - Analysis: [Brief explanation]
- Formatting: XX/100 (weight: 5%)

### Improvement Summary

**Overall Improvement:** +XX points (XX → XX)

**Key Improvements:**
- [Metric]: +XX points - [What specifically improved]
- [Metric]: +XX points - [What specifically improved]

**Impact Assessment:**
[Brief explanation of how optimizations improved the documentation quality]
```

5. **Scoring Guidelines:**
   - Be objective and consistent
   - Base scores on concrete evidence from the documentation
   - Explain reasoning for each score
   - Highlight specific improvements made
   - Final score is weighted average: (Q×0.8) + (L×0.1) + (F×0.05) + (M×0.025) + (I×0.025)

**Note:** These are estimated scores based on c7score methodology. For official scores, users can submit to Context7's benchmark.

## Common Transformation Patterns

### Transform API Reference → Complete Example

**Before:**
```
## authenticate(api_key)
Authenticates the client.
```

**After:**
```
## Authentication

```python
from library import Client

client = Client(api_key="your_key")
client.authenticate()

# Now ready to make requests
result = client.get_data()
```
```

### Transform Import-Only → Quick Start

**Before:**
```python
from library import Client, Config
```

**After:**
```python
# Install: pip install library
from library import Client, Config

# Initialize and use
config = Config(api_key="key")
client = Client(config)
result = client.query("SELECT * FROM data")
```

### Transform Multiple Small → One Comprehensive

Combine related small snippets into one complete workflow example.

## README Structure for High Scores

Organize documentation to prioritize question-answering:

1. **Quick Start** (High Priority)
   - Installation + immediate usage
   - Complete, working first example
   
2. **Common Use Cases** (High Priority)
   - Each major feature with full examples
   - Real-world scenarios
   
3. **Configuration** (Medium Priority)
   - Common configuration patterns with context
   
4. **Error Handling** (Medium Priority)
   - Practical error handling examples
   
5. **API Reference** (Lower Priority)
   - Include usage examples for each method
   
6. **Advanced Topics** (Lower Priority)
   - Complex scenarios with complete code

## Tips for High Scores

1. **Think "How would a developer use this?"** - Lead with usage, not theory
2. **Make examples copy-paste ready** - Include all imports and setup
3. **Answer questions, don't just document APIs** - Show solutions, not just signatures
4. **One snippet, one lesson** - Avoid duplicate information
5. **Format consistently** - Use proper language tags and structure
6. **Remove noise** - No licensing, directory trees, or pure imports in main docs
7. **Test your examples** - Ensure code is syntactically correct and runnable
8. **Focus on the 80%** - Question-answering dominates the score

## Skill Capabilities

This skill provides two main capabilities:

1. **C7Score Documentation Optimization** - Improve documentation quality for AI-assisted coding
2. **llms.txt File Generation** - Create LLM-friendly navigation files for projects

## When to Use This Skill

### For C7Score Optimization:
- User asks to optimize documentation for c7score

# Creating llms.txt Files

## What is llms.txt?

**llms.txt** is a standardized markdown file format designed to provide LLM-friendly content summaries and documentation navigation. It helps language models and AI agents quickly understand project structure and find relevant documentation.

Key purposes:
- Provides brief background information and guidance
- Links to detailed markdown documentation
- Optimized for consumption by language models
- Helps LLMs navigate documentation efficiently
- Used at inference time when users request information

Official specification: https://llmstxt.org/

For complete format details, read `references/llmstxt_format.md`.

## llms.txt Generation Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Project Structure

When asked to create an llms.txt file:

1. **Explore the project directory** to understand structure:
   - Identify documentation files (README.md, docs/, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.)
   - Find example files or tutorials
   - Locate API reference or configuration docs
   - Check for guides, blog posts, or additional resources

2. **Identify project type**:
   - Python library, CLI tool, web framework, Claude skill, etc.
   - This determines the appropriate section structure

3. **Assess documentation organization**:
   - Is documentation in a single README?
   - Multiple files in a docs/ directory?
   - Wiki, website, or external documentation?

### Step 2: Determine Project Category

Choose the appropriate template based on project type:

**Python Library / Package:**
- Documentation, API Reference, Examples, Development, Optional

**CLI Tool:**
- Getting Started, Commands, Configuration, Examples, Optional

**Web Framework:**
- Documentation, Guides, API Reference, Examples, Integrations, Optional

**Claude Skill:**
- Documentation, Reference Materials, Examples, Development, Optional

**General Project:**
- Documentation, Guides, Examples, Contributing, Optional

See `examples/sample_llmstxt.md` for complete examples of each type.

### Step 3: Create the Structure

Build the llms.txt file following this structure:

#### 1. H1 Title (Required)
```markdown
# Project Name
```

#### 2. Blockquote Summary (Highly Recommended)
```markdown
> Brief description of what the project does, its main purpose, and key value proposition.
> Should be 1-3 sentences that give LLMs essential context.
```

#### 3. Key Features/Principles (Optional but Helpful)
```markdown
Key features:
- Main feature or capability
- Another important aspect
- Third key point

Project follows these principles:
- Design principle 1
- Design principle 2
```

#### 4. Documentation Sections (Core Content)

Organize links into H2-headed sections:

```markdown
## Documentation

- [Link Title](https://full-url): Brief description of what this contains
- [Another Doc](https://full-url): What developers will find here

## API Reference

- [Core API](https://full-url): Main API documentation
- [Configuration](https://full-url): Configuration options

## Examples

- [Basic Usage](https://full-url): Simple getting-started examples
- [Advanced Patterns](https://full-url): Complex use cases

## Optional

- [Blog](https://full-url): Latest updates and tutorials
- [Community](https://full-url): Where to get help
```

### Step 4: Format Links Properly

Each link must follow this exact format:

```markdown
- [Descriptive Title](https://full-url): Optional helpful notes about the resource
```

**Requirements:**
- Use markdown bullet lists (`-`)
- Use markdown hyperlinks `[text](url)`
- Use **full URLs** with protocol (https://), not relative paths
- Add `:` followed by helpful description (optional but recommended)
- Prefer linking to `.md` files when possible

**Examples:**

✅ Good:
```markdown
- [Quick Start](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/docs/quickstart.md): Get running in 5 minutes
- [API Reference](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/docs/api.md): Complete function documentation
```

❌ Bad:
```markdown
- [Guide](../docs/guide.md): A guide
- Guide: docs/guide.md
- [Click here](guide)
```

### Step 5: Organize Sections by Priority

Order sections from most to least important:

**High Priority (First):**
- Documentation / Getting Started
- Core API / Commands
- Examples

**Medium Priority (Middle):**
- Guides / Tutorials
- Configuration
- Development / Contributing

**Low Priority (Last - Optional Section):**
- Blog posts
- Community links
- Changelog
- Extended tutorials
- Background reading

The **"Optional" section** has special meaning: LLMs can skip this when shorter context is needed.

### Step 6: Handle Different Repository Structures

#### GitHub Repository

For GitHub repos, construct URLs like:
```markdown
https://github.com/username/repo/blob/main/path/to/file.md
```

#### Local Files Only

If no remote repository exists yet, use placeholder URLs:
```markdown
https://github.com/username/repo/blob/main/README.md
```

And note in your response that URLs need to be updated when the repo is published.

#### Documentation Website

If project has a docs website, prefer linking to markdown versions:
```markdown
- [Guide](https://docs.example.com/guide.md): Getting started guide
```

Or link to HTML with `.md` suffix if markdown versions exist:
```markdown
- [Guide](https://docs.example.com/guide.html.md): Getting started guide
```

### Step 7: Validate the File

Before finalizing, check:

- ✅ File named exactly `llms.txt` (lowercase)
- ✅ Has H1 title as first element
- ✅ Has blockquote summary (highly recommended)
- ✅ Uses only H1 and H2 headings (no H3, H4, etc. in descriptive content)
- ✅ All links use full URLs with protocol
- ✅ Links use proper markdown format `[text](url)`
- ✅ Sections logically organized (essential → optional)
- ✅ Descriptive notes added after colons where helpful
- ✅ Content is concise and clear
- ✅ No complex markdown (tables, images, code blocks in the llms.txt itself)

## Tips for High-Quality llms.txt Files

1. **Be Concise**: Use clear, brief language in descriptions
2. **Think Like a New User**: What would they want to find first?
3. **Descriptive Links**: Use meaningful link text, not "click here"
4. **Add Context**: Notes after colons help LLMs understand what each link contains
5. **Stable URLs**: Link to versioned or permanent documentation
6. **Progressive Detail**: Start with essentials, end with optional resources
7. **Test Comprehension**: Read it yourself - does it make sense quickly?
8. **Keep Updated**: Update as documentation structure evolves

## Output Format for llms.txt Generation

When generating an llms.txt file, provide:

1. **Analysis summary** - Project type, documentation structure, identified resources
2. **Generated llms.txt file** - Complete, properly formatted file
3. **File placement instructions** - Where to save it (repository root)
4. **URL update notes** - If using placeholder URLs that need updating
5. **Suggestions** - Additional documentation that could improve the file

Save the file as `llms.txt` in the project root directory.

## Integration with C7Score Optimization

llms.txt generation can be combined with c7score optimization:

1. **Optimize documentation first** - Improve README and docs for c7score
2. **Then generate llms.txt** - Create navigation file pointing to optimized docs
3. **Result**: High-quality documentation with LLM-friendly navigation

Or generate them independently based on user needs.
