# Code Reviewing

Systematic code review skill based on industry best practices from Google Engineering, OWASP, and modern development standards. Designed to catch issues that casual review misses through structured, checklist-driven analysis.

**Core Principle (Google):** Approve code that improves overall code health, even if not perfect. Seek continuous improvement, not perfection. But NEVER approve code that degrades code health.

## When to Use This Skill

**Auto-activation triggers:**

- After completing significant implementation tasks
- Before committing changes
- When reviewing PRs or staged files

**Explicit activation triggers:**

- User asks to "review", "check", "audit", or "examine" code
- User mentions "code review", "PR review", "look at this code"
- User asks about code quality or standards compliance

## Interactive Review Scoping

Use AskUserQuestion to determine review depth and risk profile when not specified:

```yaml
# Question 1: Review Depth (MCP: Google Engineering code review, OWASP)
question: "What type of code review is needed?"
header: "Review Type"
options:
  - label: "Quick Review (Recommended)"
    description: "Surface issues, style, obvious bugs (~15 min, ~3.5K tokens)"
  - label: "Thorough Review"
    description: "Multi-pass: logic, design, tests (~45 min, ~14K tokens)"
  - label: "Security Review"
    description: "Threat-focused: auth, validation, crypto (~30 min)"
  - label: "Architecture Review"
    description: "Design patterns, dependencies, coupling (~60 min)"

# Question 2: Risk Profile (MCP: CLI best practices - scope selection)
question: "What is the risk profile of this change?"
header: "Risk"
options:
  - label: "Low Risk (Recommended)"
    description: "Isolated fix, well-tested area, no user impact"
  - label: "Medium Risk"
    description: "Feature change, moderate scope, reversible"
  - label: "High Risk"
    description: "Critical path, security-sensitive, wide impact"
  - label: "Unknown"
    description: "I'm not sure - analyze and recommend"
```

Use these responses to select the appropriate review profile (quick, thorough, security, strict, performance).

## Review Workflow

```text
Code Review Progress:
- [ ] Step 0: RESEARCH PHASE (MANDATORY - Run MCP queries for technology stack)
- [ ] Step 0b: LOAD REPO CONFIG (Check .claude/code-review.md, fallback to CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] Step 0e: Git History Analysis (coupling, hot spots, author context - thorough/strict only)
- [ ] Step 1: Count files to review (accurate file counting)
- [ ] Step 1b: Detect generated content (scan for markers, identify generators)
- [ ] Step 2: Identify scope (files to review, excluding generated files)
- [ ] Step 3: Load context (repo standards + MCP research results + repo config)
- [ ] Step 4: Run Universal Checks (Layer 1) - informed by MCP research
- [ ] Step 5: Run Repo-Specific Checks (Layer 2, applying repo config rules)
- [ ] Step 5b: Run Claude Code Validation (Tier 4b, if CC files detected)
- [ ] Step 6: Report ALL findings with severity, rule source, and MCP validation status
- [ ] Step 7: Propose specific fixes with rationale and MCP-backed recommendations
```

### Step 0: RESEARCH PHASE (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL: This step runs BEFORE any code analysis. It is NOT optional.**

Query MCP servers to understand current patterns and best practices BEFORE reviewing code. This prevents making claims based on stale training data.

**Load Reference:** [references/tier-0/research-phase.md](references/tier-0/research-phase.md)

**Quick Reference:**

1. **Detect Technology Stack** (from file extensions, imports, manifests)
2. **Query MCP Servers** (parallel queries based on detected technologies):
   - Microsoft tech (.NET, Azure, C#) → `microsoft-learn` + `perplexity` (ALWAYS dual-validate)
   - npm/PyPI packages → `context7` + `ref`
   - Security patterns → `perplexity` (OWASP)
   - Version claims → `perplexity` (ALWAYS validate)
3. **Build Current Truth Context** (store validated patterns for use during analysis)

**Core Rules:**

- **Research BEFORE analysis** - Know current best practices before making claims
- **Perplexity ALWAYS required** - Training data is stale; always cross-validate
- **Dual validation for Microsoft tech** - `microsoft-learn` can be stale, ALWAYS pair with `perplexity`
- **Every finding needs a source** - No finding without authoritative validation

**High-Risk Technologies (Extra Perplexity Validation Required):**

- .NET 10, .NET Aspire, Azure AI Foundry, HybridCache, Microsoft.Extensions.AI

### Step 0b: Load Repository Configuration

**Load repo-specific rules to customize the review.**

**Load Reference:** [references/tier-4/repo-config.md](references/tier-4/repo-config.md)

**Configuration Priority Chain:**

```text
1. .claude/code-review.md (PRIMARY)
   ├── Found: Parse config, apply rules, STOP
   └── Not found: Continue to fallback

1.5. .claude/rules/*.md (NATIVE - auto-loaded by Claude Code runtime)
     Always in context, supplements other config, path-scoped support

2. CLAUDE.md + @imports (FALLBACK)
   ├── Found: Read CLAUDE.md + follow @imports
   │   └── Extract rules from ## Critical Rules, ## Conventions sections
   └── Not found: Continue to fallback

3. No config found
   ├── Interactive mode: Use AskUserQuestion
   │   └── "No review configuration found. Review with default rules?"
   └── Non-interactive: Apply default rules only
```

**What Gets Loaded:**

| Source | What's Parsed |
| --- | --- |
| `.claude/code-review.md` | Tech Stack, Exclude Rules, Severity Overrides, Custom Checks |
| `.claude/rules/*.md` | Auto-injected by runtime; treat as additional review rules |
| CLAUDE.md + @imports | Text from ## Critical Rules, ## Conventions, ## Code Review sections |

**Config Effects:**

| Config Section | Effect on Review |
| --- | --- |
| Tech Stack | Override auto-detection, improve MCP query accuracy |
| Exclude Rules | Skip these rules entirely (no findings generated) |
| Severity Overrides | Change default severity for specific rules |
| Custom Checks | Add project-specific checks (file patterns, content rules) |

**Quick Reference:**

```bash
# Check if config exists
ls .claude/code-review.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No config, will use CLAUDE.md fallback"

# Preview what config will be loaded (via review command)
/code-quality:review --show-rules
```

**Agent Applicability:**

ALL agents loading the code-reviewing skill MUST execute Step 0b. This includes
code-reviewer, quality-reviewer, and security-reviewer. Each agent independently
loads and applies repo config within its own domain.

**Security Exclusion Advisory:**

When repo config excludes security-related rules, agents MUST emit an ADVISORY note:
"ADVISORY: Security rule '{rule}' excluded by repo config. Ensure intentional."
This is informational only -- not a finding, not blocking.

### Step 0e: Git History Analysis

**Triggered by:** `thorough` or `strict` profile (partial for `security`/`performance`)

**Load Reference:** [references/tier-1/git-history-context.md](references/tier-1/git-history-context.md)

Extract git history context to inform review priorities and catch coupling issues:

1. **Read Configuration** - Check `.claude/code-review.md` for history analysis settings
2. **Coupling Analysis** - Find files that frequently change together
3. **Hot Spot Detection** - Identify high-churn files (configurable threshold, default: 10+ changes in 3 months)
4. **Author Context** - Extract ownership patterns (`strict` profile only)
5. **Recent Patterns** - Detect bug fix, security, or refactoring history

**Quick Reference Commands:**

```bash
# Coupling analysis - files that change together
git log --name-only --pretty=format: -- <files> | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20

# Hot spot detection - change frequency
git log --since="3 months ago" --name-only --pretty=format: | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20

# Author context - ownership
git shortlog -sn -- <files>

# Recent patterns - commit messages
git log --oneline -10 -- <files>
```

**Profile Behavior:**

| Profile | Analysis Depth |
| --- | --- |
| quick | Skip entirely |
| security | Partial (security-related commits only) |
| thorough | Coupling + hot spots + recent patterns |
| strict | Full analysis including author context |
| performance | Partial (perf-related history only) |

### Step 1: Count Files (Accurate File Counting)

Before reviewing, count the files to ensure accurate reporting:

| Review Scope | Counting Command |
| --- | --- |
| Staged changes | `git diff --staged --name-only \| wc -l` |
| PR changes | `git diff --name-only main...HEAD \| wc -l` |
| Specific paths | Use Glob tool and count results |

**Important**:

- Track this count accurately - report it in **Files Reviewed** output
- Exclude binary files (images, compiled assets) from review count
- Exclude deleted files from review count (nothing to review)
- For renamed files: count as 1 file (the new name)

**Large Changeset Warnings**:

- 50+ files: Consider batched review or consensus mode
- 100+ files: Strongly recommend breaking into smaller chunks

### Step 1b: Detect Generated Content

Scan changed files for generation markers to identify files that were created by scripts/tools. Review the generator (source of truth) instead of generated output.

**Detection Markers** (scan first 20 + last 10 lines):

| File Type | Markers |
| --- | --- |
| Markdown | `Generated: YYYY-MM-DD`, `<!-- Generated by ScriptName -->` |
| JSON | Root `"timestamp"` or `"generator"` fields |
| Scripts | `Auto-generated from`, `DO NOT EDIT`, `Generated by` |
| Code | `// <auto-generated>`, `@generated`, `*.g.cs`, `*.generated.ts` |

**Workflow**:

1. Scan changed files for markers
2. If marker found: extract generator name, search for script, add to review scope
3. Mark generated files for skip/light review
4. Warn if only generated files changed (may indicate stale regeneration)

**Edge Cases**:

- Generator also changed → Review generator only, skip generated
- Only generated changed → Warn: stale regeneration or manual edit
- Generator not found → Review generated file anyway
- Security-sensitive generated file → Still review (credentials, config)

Load [references/tier-5/generated-content-detection.md](references/tier-5/generated-content-detection.md) for complete detection patterns and algorithm.

### Step 2: Identify Scope

- **Explicit request**: User-specified files or changes
- **Staged changes**: `git diff --staged` or `git status`
- **Recent work**: Files modified in current session
- **PR scope**: All files in a pull request

### Step 3: Load Context

Check for repo-specific standards. If found, load for Layer 2 checks.

### Review Profiles

When `--profile <name>` is specified, restrict tier loading to profile-specific subsets. This enables focused reviews for specific concerns.

**Available Profiles:**

| Profile | Tiers Loaded | Description | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `security` | 0, 1.3, 3-security | OWASP, secrets, auth, crypto | Fast security scan before merge |
| `quick` | 1.1-1.6, 1.12 | Design, logic, style basics | Pre-commit fast check |
| `thorough` | All tiers + 1.30-1.32 | Complete analysis + reference/pattern checks | PR review (default) |
| `strict` | All thorough + deep patterns | Full analysis + architectural pattern enforcement | Library releases, major changes |
| `performance` | 0, 1.5, 2-backend, 3-concurrency | N+1, complexity, memory, concurrency | Performance audit |

**Profile Tier Mappings:**

```text
security:
  - Tier 0: Research Phase (ALWAYS - detect auth/crypto libraries)
  - Tier 1.3: Security (OWASP-Based)
  - Tier 3: security-patterns.md (when auth/crypto patterns detected)
  - Skip: Design, readability, testing, documentation

quick:
  - Tier 1.1: Design and Architecture (basic structure)
  - Tier 1.2: Functionality and Logic (obvious errors)
  - Tier 1.3: Security (CRITICAL only - hardcoded secrets)
  - Tier 1.4: Concurrency (obvious race conditions)
  - Tier 1.5: Performance (N+1, obvious inefficiencies)
  - Tier 1.6: Complexity (extreme violations)
  - Tier 1.12: Style (consistency)
  - Skip: Tier 0 MCP research, Tier 2+, Clean Code deep-dives

thorough:
  - ALL tiers loaded based on file types/patterns
  - Complete analysis (default behavior)
  - Section 1.30: Reference Integrity (always when renames/deletions detected)
  - Section 1.31: Breaking Changes (always for public API changes)
  - Section 1.32: Pattern Compliance (basic pattern checks)
  - Sections 1.33-1.36: Git History Context (coupling, hot spots, recent patterns)

strict:
  - ALL 'thorough' checks
  - Section 1.32 Pattern Compliance (full analysis):
    - Architectural pattern deviation (CQRS, mediator, repository)
    - DI registration consistency
    - File organization enforcement
  - Section 1.35: Author Context (ownership patterns, bus factor)
  - Import/export hygiene (module boundaries, barrel pollution)
  - Test correlation (orphaned tests detection)
  - Dependency safety (migration verification)

performance:
  - Tier 0: Research Phase (performance best practices via MCP)
  - Tier 1.5: Performance and Efficiency
  - Tier 2: backend-checks.md (database, API performance)
  - Tier 3: concurrency-patterns.md (async, threading)
  - Skip: Style, documentation, clean code deep-dives
```

**Token Savings by Profile:**

| Profile | Est. Tokens | Savings vs Strict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| security | ~5,500 | 60%+ |
| quick | ~3,500 | 75%+ |
| thorough | ~14,000 | 15% |
| strict | ~17,000 | 0% (baseline) |
| performance | ~6,000 | 65%+ |

### Baseline Mode (Differential Analysis)

When `--baseline <branch>` is specified, attribute each finding as NEW or PRE-EXISTING.

**Why This Matters:**
This is the #1 adoption blocker for code review tools. Teams with tech debt get overwhelmed by 100+ findings when their PR only introduces 3 new issues. They give up on the tool.

**Baseline Mode Workflow:**

1. **Build attribution map** from git diff:

   ```bash
   git diff <baseline>...HEAD  # Three-dot for symmetric comparison
   ```

2. **Parse diff** to identify changed line ranges per file
3. **For each finding**: Check if `file:line` is in changed ranges
4. **Tag findings**: NEW (line added/modified) or PRE-EXISTING (unchanged)
5. **Separate output**: New issues prominent, pre-existing collapsed

**Finding Attribution Rules:**

| Line Status | Attribution | Output Section |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Added (`+` in diff) | NEW | "New Issues Introduced" |
| Modified (in hunk, changed) | NEW | "New Issues Introduced" |
| Context (in hunk, unchanged) | PRE-EXISTING | "Pre-existing Issues" (collapsed) |
| Not in any hunk | PRE-EXISTING | "Pre-existing Issues" (collapsed) |
| Deleted (`-` in diff) | SKIP | Not reviewed (doesn't exist) |

**Baseline Output Format:**

```markdown
## Review Summary (Baseline Mode)

**Baseline**: `main`
**New Issues (this changeset)**: 2 CRITICAL, 1 MAJOR ← FOCUS HERE
**Pre-existing Issues**: 47 (collapsed)
**Assessment**: Based on NEW issues only

## New Issues Introduced
[Detailed findings with Attribution: NEW]

<details>
<summary>Pre-existing Issues (47)</summary>
[Condensed findings]
</details>
```

**Quality Gates (CI/CD):**

- `--fail-on-new-critical`: Exit 1 if ANY new CRITICAL
- `--fail-on-new-major`: Exit 1 if ANY new MAJOR
- Pre-existing issues do NOT fail the build

**Edge Cases:**

- Baseline doesn't exist → Error with valid branch suggestions
- File renamed → Attribute based on content changes
- Merge commits → Use three-dot diff for correct comparison

### Complexity Thresholds

Use these concrete thresholds when evaluating code complexity:

| Metric | Warning | Error | Measurement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cyclomatic Complexity | > 10 | > 20 | Count decision points (if, while, for, case, &&, \|\|, ?) |
| Cognitive Complexity | > 15 | > 30 | SonarQube metric (nesting adds more weight) |
| Function Lines | > 30 | > 50 | Count non-blank, non-comment lines |
| Nesting Depth | > 3 | > 5 | Count nested braces/indentation levels |
| Parameter Count | > 4 | > 7 | Count function/method parameters |
| File Lines | > 300 | > 500 | Count total lines in file |

**When thresholds exceeded:**

- Warning → MINOR severity finding
- Error → MAJOR severity finding

**Suggested Fix Template:**

```markdown
### Complexity Threshold Exceeded

**File**: `src/services/order.ts:processOrder()`
**Severity**: MAJOR
**Metric**: Cyclomatic Complexity = 23 (threshold: 15, error: 20)

**Problem**: Function has 23 independent paths through the code.

**Impact**: Difficult to test (need 23+ test cases), hard to maintain, high bug risk.

**Fix**: Extract methods for logical branches. Consider:
- Extract validation logic → `validateOrder()`
- Extract pricing logic → `calculatePrice()`
- Extract notification logic → `notifyCustomer()`
```

### Progressive Loading (Token Optimization)

This skill uses **tiered progressive disclosure** to optimize token usage. Only load what's relevant to the files being reviewed.

**Tier 0 (MANDATORY - Always First):** Research Phase (~2,000 tokens)

- **ALWAYS load BEFORE analysis**: [references/tier-0/research-phase.md](references/tier-0/research-phase.md)
- Contains: Technology detection matrix, MCP query templates, "Build Truth Context" workflow
- Purpose: Query MCP servers to understand current patterns BEFORE making any claims
- **This tier is NOT optional** - skip only if code is purely internal with no external dependencies

**Tier 1 (Always Applied):** Universal checks in this file (~4,500 tokens)

- Sections 1.1-1.12: Design, Logic, Security, Concurrency, Performance, Readability, Testing, Error Handling, Documentation, Cross-Platform, Anti-Duplication, Style
- Sections 1.25-1.29: Clean Code (Names, Functions, Comments, Conditionals, Code Smells)
- Section 1.30: Reference Integrity - [references/tier-1/reference-integrity.md](references/tier-1/reference-integrity.md) (when renames/deletions detected)
- Section 1.31: Breaking Changes - [references/tier-1/breaking-changes.md](references/tier-1/breaking-changes.md) (for public API changes)

| Profile thorough/strict | [references/tier-4/pattern-compliance.md](references/tier-4/pattern-compliance.md) |

**Tier 4b (Claude Code Components):** Delegate to specialized auditors when CC files detected

| File Pattern | Component Type | Auditor Agent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.claude/agents/**/*.md`, `agents/*.md` | Agent | `claude-ecosystem:agent-auditor` |
| `.claude/skills/**`, `skills/*/SKILL.md` | Skill | `claude-ecosystem:skill-auditor` |
| `.claude/hooks/**`, `hooks.json` | Hook | `claude-ecosystem:hook-auditor` |
| `.claude/skills/**` | Skill | `claude-ecosystem:skill-auditor` |
| `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/memory/**` | Memory | `claude-ecosystem:memory-component-auditor` |
| `output-styles/*.md` | Output Style | `claude-ecosystem:output-style-auditor` |

| `plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/**` | Plugin | `claude-ecosystem:plugin-component-auditor` |
| Status line scripts | Status Line | `claude-ecosystem:statusline-auditor` |

Load the reference for complete detection and delegation patterns: [references/tier-4/claude-code-components.md](references/tier-4/claude-code-components.md)

**Note**: Tier 4b requires the `claude-ecosystem` plugin to be installed. If not installed, log a warning and skip CC-specific validation (continue with standard review).

> **Auditor Agent Verification:** Agent names may change between plugin releases. Run `/claude-ecosystem:list skills`
> to verify current auditor agent names if delegation fails. The table above reflects known agents as of this file's last update.

**Tier 5 (Generated Content & MCP Validation Details):** Load based on changeset characteristics

| Trigger | Load Reference |
| --- | --- |
| Large changeset (50+ files) | [references/tier-5/generated-content-detection.md](references/tier-5/generated-content-detection.md) |
| Generation markers found | [references/tier-5/generated-content-detection.md](references/tier-5/generated-content-detection.md) |
| Need advanced MCP query patterns | [references/tier-5/mcp-validation.md](references/tier-5/mcp-validation.md) |
| Complex technology stack | [references/tier-5/mcp-validation.md](references/tier-5/mcp-validation.md) |
| Security patterns require OWASP validation | [references/tier-5/mcp-validation.md](references/tier-5/mcp-validation.md) |

**Note:** Primary MCP validation happens in **Tier 0 (Research Phase)** which is MANDATORY. Tier 5 `mcp-validation.md` provides additional query templates and advanced patterns for complex scenarios.

**Token Budget Estimates:**

| Scenario | Tokens |
| --- | --- |
| Tier 0 Research Phase (MANDATORY) | ~2,000 (always included) |
| Simple Python file | ~8,500 (Tier 0 + Hub + backend) |
| React component | ~8,000 (Tier 0 + Hub + frontend) |
| Auth service | ~10,000 (Tier 0 + Hub + backend + security) |
| Full-stack PR | ~11,500 (Tier 0 + Hub + frontend + backend + API) |
| Documentation file (CLAUDE.md repo) | ~8,500 (Tier 0 + Hub + core-rules + documentation-rules) |
| Skill modification | ~8,000 (Tier 0 + Hub + core-rules + skill-rules) |
| Memory file update | ~7,500 (Tier 0 + Hub + core-rules + memory-rules) |
| With advanced MCP patterns | +~1,200 tokens (Tier 5 mcp-validation.md) |
| With CC auditor delegation | +~1,500 tokens (Tier 4b reference + auditor spawn overhead) |
| With generated content detection | +~1,200 tokens (Tier 5 generated-content-detection.md) |
| With git history context (thorough/strict) | +~1,500 tokens (Tier 1 git-history-context.md) |

**Note:** Token budgets increased by ~2,000 tokens due to MANDATORY Tier 0 Research Phase. This trade-off provides significantly more accurate reviews through MCP validation.

- [ ] **Tests maintainable** - Not overly complex, clear assertions
- [ ] **No flaky tests** - Deterministic, not timing-dependent

**Test Smell Detection:**

Review test code for common test smells that reduce test quality and maintainability:

| Smell | Detection | Severity | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Empty Test** | Test method with no assertions | CRITICAL | False confidence - test always passes |
| **Eager Test** | > 5 assertions in one test | WARNING | When it fails, unclear which behavior broke |
| **Mystery Guest** | External file/network access without mock | MAJOR | Flaky, slow, environment-dependent |
| **Assertion Roulette** | Multiple asserts without descriptive messages | MINOR | Hard to identify which assertion failed |
| **Sleep in Test** | `Thread.Sleep`, `await Task.Delay`, `setTimeout` | MAJOR | Slow, flaky, hides timing bugs |
| **Dead Test** | Test that never fails (always passes) | WARNING | Usually tests nothing meaningful |
| **Commented Test** | Disabled test cases (`[Ignore]`, `skip`, `xtest`) | WARNING | Technical debt, may hide real issues |
| **Test Code Duplication** | Same setup/teardown in multiple tests | MINOR | Maintenance burden, use fixtures |

**Example Findings:**

```markdown
### Test Smell: Eager Test

**File**: `tests/UserService.test.ts:45`
**Severity**: WARNING
**Confidence**: MEDIUM

**Problem**: Test "should handle user operations" has 12 assertions testing multiple behaviors.

**Impact**: When this test fails, you won't know which behavior broke without debugging.

**Suggested Fix**:
```typescript
// Before (Eager Test - 12 assertions, multiple behaviors)
test('should handle user operations', () => {
  const user = createUser();
  expect(user.name).toBe('John');
  expect(user.email).toContain('@');
  // ... 10 more assertions about different behaviors
});

// After (Focused Tests - one behavior each)
test('should create user with valid name', () => {
  const user = createUser();
  expect(user.name).toBe('John');
});

test('should validate email format', () => {
  const user = createUser();
  expect(user.email).toContain('@');
});
```

```text

```markdown
### Test Smell: Sleep in Test

**File**: `tests/api.test.ts:78`
**Severity**: MAJOR
**Confidence**: HIGH

**Problem**: Test uses `await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 2000))` to wait for async operation.

**Impact**: Test is slow (2 seconds), flaky (timing varies), and hides real async handling bugs.

**Suggested Fix**:
```typescript
// Before (Sleep - slow and flaky)
await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 2000));
expect(result).toBeDefined();

// After (Proper async handling)
await waitFor(() => expect(result).toBeDefined());
// Or
await expect(asyncOperation()).resolves.toBeDefined();
```

- [ ] **Model monitoring** - Drift detection for data and performance

### 1.25 Clean Code: Names (Robert C. Martin)

- [ ] **Intention-revealing names** - Name tells you why it exists, what it does, how it's used
- [ ] **No misleading names** - `accountList` should actually be a list; avoid false clues
- [ ] **Meaningful distinctions** - Not `data1`, `data2`, `dataInfo`, `theData`
- [ ] **Pronounceable names** - Can discuss code verbally without spelling variables
- [ ] **Searchable names** - Single-letter names only for small local scope
- [ ] **No encodings** - No Hungarian notation, no type prefixes (strName, intCount)
- [ ] **No mental mapping** - Reader shouldn't translate names to concepts they know
- [ ] **Class names are nouns** - Customer, Account, Parser (not verbs)
- [ ] **Method names are verbs** - postPayment, deletePage, save (not nouns)

### 1.26 Clean Code: Functions (Robert C. Martin)

- [ ] **Small** - 5-20 lines ideal; rarely exceed 30 lines
- [ ] **Do one thing** - Single level of abstraction; one reason to change
- [ ] **One abstraction level** - Don't mix getHtml() with .append("\n")
- [ ] **Descriptive names** - Long descriptive name better than short enigmatic one
- [ ] **Few arguments** - Zero ideal, one/two good, three questionable, never more than four
- [ ] **No flag arguments** - Split function into two instead of passing boolean
- [ ] **No side effects** - Don't modify unexpected state; function does what name says only
- [ ] **Command/Query separation** - Either do something OR answer something, never both
- [ ] **Prefer exceptions to error codes** - Don't return -1 or null for errors
- [ ] **Extract try/catch blocks** - Bodies of try/catch should be one-line function calls

### 1.27 Clean Code: Comments (Robert C. Martin)

- [ ] **Code explains itself first** - If you need a comment, try rewriting the code
- [ ] **Comments explain WHY** - Not what (code shows what) or how (code shows how)
- [ ] **Legal comments acceptable** - Copyright, license headers
- [ ] **Informative comments acceptable** - Regex explanation, return value meaning
- [ ] **TODO comments have tickets** - `// TODO: TICKET-123 - refactor after API v2`
- [ ] **No redundant comments** - `// Constructor` above a constructor is noise
- [ ] **No commented-out code** - Delete it; version control remembers
- [ ] **No closing brace comments** - `} // end if` means function is too long
- [ ] **No attribution comments** - `// Added by Bob` - use version control blame
- [ ] **No journal comments** - Change logs belong in VCS, not code

### 1.28 Clean Code: Conditionals (Pragmatic Programmer)

- [ ] **Positive conditions** - `if (isValid)` not `if (!isInvalid)`
- [ ] **No double negatives** - `if (!notFound)` should be `if (found)`
- [ ] **Guard clauses** - Early return for edge cases; avoid deep nesting
- [ ] **Explanatory variables** - Extract complex conditions to named booleans
- [ ] **Encapsulate conditionals** - `if (shouldBeDeleted(timer))` not `if (timer.hasExpired() && !timer.isRecurrent())`
- [ ] **Avoid negative conditionals** - `if (buffer.shouldCompact())` not `if (!buffer.shouldNotCompact())`
- [ ] **Polymorphism over switch** - Type-based switches often indicate missing polymorphism
- [ ] **No null checks everywhere** - Use Null Object pattern or Optional types

### 1.29 Code Smells Quick Reference

| Smell | Detection | Impact | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Long Method** | > 30 lines | Maintainability | Extract methods |
| **Long Parameter List** | > 4 parameters | Usability | Introduce parameter object |
| **Deep Nesting** | > 3-4 indent levels | Readability | Guard clauses, extract method |
| **Magic Numbers** | Hardcoded values | Maintainability | Named constants |
| **God Class** | Class does too much | Testability, coupling | Extract classes by responsibility |
| **Feature Envy** | Method uses other class's data | Coupling | Move method to data class |
| **Duplicate Code** | Same logic repeated | DRY violation | Extract to shared function |
| **Dead Code** | Unused code | Clutter, confusion | Delete it |
| **Primitive Obsession** | Overuse of primitives | Type safety | Value objects |
| **Shotgun Surgery** | One change touches many files | Fragility | Consolidate related code |
| **Divergent Change** | One class changed for many reasons | SRP violation | Split by reason for change |
| **Data Clumps** | Same data appears together | Missing abstraction | Create class for data group |
| **Comments** | Explaining bad code | Readability | Rewrite the code |
| **Speculative Generality** | Code for "future needs" | Complexity | Delete unused abstractions |

### 1.30 Reference Integrity (Rename/Cleanup Validation)

- [ ] **String literals checked** - Hardcoded references to old names (low confidence, profile-gated)

**Detection:**

```bash
# Detect renames and deletions from git diff
git diff --name-status HEAD~1 | grep -E '^[RD]'
```

**Severity:**

| Check | Severity | Always-On |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Broken imports after rename | CRITICAL | Yes |
| Stale documentation links | MAJOR | Yes |
| Orphaned config references | MAJOR | Yes |

**Detection:**

```bash
# Identify removed public members
git diff HEAD~1 | grep "^-.*public\s"
```

**Severity:**

| Check | Severity | Always-On |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public API removal | CRITICAL | Yes |
| Signature change | CRITICAL | Yes |

| **LOW** | Heuristic/stylistic, may be false positive | NO - Describe issue only |

**Confidence Assignment Logic:**

```text
1. Pattern match detected?
   ├── YES + MCP validates pattern → HIGH
   ├── YES + No MCP validation → MEDIUM
   └── NO → Continue to heuristics

2. Anti-pattern recognized?
   ├── YES + Clear remediation path → MEDIUM
   └── YES + Ambiguous remediation → LOW

3. Stylistic/subjective concern?
   └── Always → LOW
```

**Examples by Confidence Level:**

| Finding | Confidence | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SQL injection via string concat | HIGH | Exact pattern, OWASP-documented fix |
| Missing null check | MEDIUM | Recognized pattern, context-dependent fix |
| Method too long (35 lines) | LOW | Heuristic, may be acceptable in context |
| Variable naming suggestion | LOW | Stylistic preference |

### Suggested Fix Guidelines

**Include Suggested Fix when:**

1. **Confidence is HIGH** - Pattern match + MCP validated
2. **Fix is deterministic** - Only one correct way to fix
3. **MCP provides code pattern** - Fix based on authoritative source

**Suggested Fix Format:**

```markdown
**Suggested Fix**:
```csharp
// Before (vulnerable)
var query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Id = " + userId;

// After (parameterized - OWASP recommendation)
var query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Id = @userId";
cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@userId", userId);
```

```text

**Omit Suggested Fix when:**

1. **Confidence is LOW** - May be false positive
2. **Multiple valid approaches** - User should choose
3. **Context-dependent** - Requires understanding broader system
4. **MCP unavailable** - Cannot validate the fix pattern

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

- **"Looks good overall"** - Never without systematic checklist review
- **Benefit of the doubt** - If questionable, it IS a finding
- **Summarizing** - Critically analyze against checklist
- **Missing security issues** - Always check OWASP basics
- **Ignoring concurrency** - Think through race conditions
- **Skipping similar files** - Always diff files with similar purposes
- **Vague fixes** - "Fix this" vs "Replace lines X-Y with..."
- **Partial table verification** - Never verify only SOME items from a reference table; if you cite a table, verify ALL items with Glob or git status
- **Concluding files missing without Glob** - When uncertain if files exist, use `Glob pattern="path/**/*.md"` to verify rather than assuming based on what you haven't read

## Behavioral Rules

1. **Be skeptical, not charitable** - Assume problems until verified clean
2. **Every line matters** - Review ALL code assigned, understand it
3. **Think like an attacker** - What could go wrong? How could this be exploited?
4. **Think like a user** - Both end-user and developer-user
5. **Context matters** - View changes in context of whole file/system
6. **Report everything** - Every issue, with appropriate severity
7. **Propose specific fixes** - Concrete code, not vague suggestions
8. **Acknowledge good things** - Compliment well-done code

## Quick Reference Card

```text
ALWAYS CHECK:
[ ] Security: inputs validated, outputs encoded, no secrets
[ ] Concurrency: shared state protected, no race conditions
[ ] Design: SOLID principles, appropriate complexity
[ ] Tests: present, correct, useful
[ ] Platform: no hardcoded paths, portable detection
[ ] Duplicates: diff similar files
[ ] Accessibility: alt text, contrast, keyboard nav, semantic HTML
[ ] i18n: no hardcoded strings, locale-aware formatting
[ ] Observability: structured logs, metrics, traces, health checks
[ ] Privacy: PII protected, no PII in logs, consent tracked

CLEAN CODE (Robert C. Martin):
[ ] Names: intention-revealing, pronounceable, searchable, no encodings
[ ] Functions: small (5-20 lines), do one thing, few args (0-2), no side effects
[ ] Comments: explain WHY not WHAT, no commented-out code, no redundancy
[ ] Conditionals: positive conditions, guard clauses, no double negatives

DOMAIN-SPECIFIC (when applicable):
[ ] API: versioning, backward compat, error format
[ ] Database: N+1 avoided, indexes, migrations safe
[ ] Config: secrets in vault, feature flags, 12-factor
[ ] Frontend: component design, bundle size, web vitals
[ ] Mobile: battery/memory/network efficient, offline-first
[ ] AI/ML: model versioning, reproducibility, bias detection

CODE SMELLS (watch for):
- Long methods (> 30 lines)
- Long parameter lists (> 4 params)
- Deep nesting (> 3-4 levels)
- God classes (too many responsibilities)
- Feature envy (method uses other class's data)
- Primitive obsession (should use value objects)
- Shotgun surgery (one change touches many files)

RED FLAGS:
- Long if/else chains (OCP violation)
- Explicit type casting (LSP violation)
- new keyword overuse (DIP violation)
- String concatenation in queries (injection)
- Shared state without locks (race condition)
- Catch-all exception handlers (error hiding)
- Magic numbers/strings (maintainability)
- Platform-specific paths (portability)
- Missing alt text on images (accessibility)
- Hardcoded user-facing strings (i18n)
- console.log instead of structured logging (observability)
- PII in log statements (privacy violation)
```

## Version History

- v9.0.0 (2025-12-31): **MAJOR: Enhanced Validation Gaps** - Added 6 new validation capabilities: (1) Reference Integrity (section 1.30) - validates imports, docs links, config after renames/deletions; (2) Breaking Change Detection (section 1.31) - detects public API removals, signature changes; (3) Pattern Compliance (section 1.32) - verifies error handling, naming, architecture consistency; (4) Import/Export Hygiene - unused imports, circular deps, module boundaries; (5) Test Impact Correlation - code changes without test updates; (6) Dependency Update Safety - major version bumps, breaking changes. Added new `strict` profile for library releases. Token budget updated: thorough ~14K, strict ~17K.
- v8.0.0 (2025-12-29): **MAJOR: Research-First MCP Validation** - Added MANDATORY Step 0 (Research Phase) that runs BEFORE any code analysis; added Tier 0 to progressive loading (always first); MCP validation is now exhaustive and required, not conditional; all findings must include validation status; added Technology Research Summary and MCP Validation Summary to report format; perplexity ALWAYS required for Microsoft tech (dual-validation); token budgets increased ~2,000 tokens for accuracy trade-off
- v7.0.0 (2025-12-29): Added generated content detection (Step 1b); detects files created by scripts/tools via content-based markers; redirects review to generator scripts (source of truth); reduces review noise in large changesets; added Tier 5 reference for detection patterns and algorithm
