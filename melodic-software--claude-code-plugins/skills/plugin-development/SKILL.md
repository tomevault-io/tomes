## Topic Coverage

### Plugin Structure

- .claude-plugin/ directory
- plugin.json manifest file
- agents/ directory for subagents
- skills/ directory for skills
- hooks/ directory with hooks.json
- .mcp.json for MCP servers

### Component Auto-Discovery & Default Locations

Plugin components may be auto-discovered from default locations. Query docs-management for current behavior:

**Query Keywords:**

- "plugin auto-discovery", "default locations", "component discovery"
- "plugin default paths", "path behavior rules"
- "hooks default location", "commands default location"
- "plugin optional fields", "required vs optional"

**Key Principle:** Before flagging missing manifest fields, query docs-management to verify whether the component uses auto-discovery from a default location. Many manifest fields are optional when components exist at their default paths.

### Plugin Manifest (plugin.json)

- name field (required)
- description field
- version field (semantic versioning)
- author object
- Additional metadata fields

### Plugin Component Types

- Agents (markdown files in agents/)
- Skills (SKILL.md files in skills/)
- Hooks (hooks.json configuration)
- MCP servers (.mcp.json configuration)

### Plugin Installation Commands

- /plugin (interactive menu)
- /plugin install plugin-name@marketplace
- /plugin uninstall plugin-name@marketplace
- /plugin enable plugin-name@marketplace
- /plugin disable plugin-name@marketplace
- /plugin marketplace add

### Marketplace Configuration

- marketplace.json structure
- name and owner fields
- plugins array with source references
- Local vs remote marketplace sources
- Git repository marketplaces

### Team Plugin Workflows

- Repository-level configuration (.claude/settings.json)
- Automatic installation on trust
- Team-wide plugin consistency
- Rollout best practices

### Development Workflow

- Local marketplace setup
- Development directory structure
- Plugin iteration cycle (uninstall/reinstall)
- Testing components individually

### Debugging Techniques

- Structure verification
- Component isolation testing
- Validation tools
- Common issue resolution

### Distribution Strategies

- README documentation
- Semantic versioning
- Marketplace submission
- Team testing before release
- **Marketplace registration** (see below)

### Marketplace Registration (CRITICAL)

**⚠️ ALWAYS register new plugins in marketplace.json** - plugins are NOT discoverable until registered.

**When creating a new plugin, you MUST:**

1. Create the plugin structure (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, components)
2. Register the plugin in `marketplace.json` with proper entry format
3. Verify registration by checking `/plugin` command lists the new plugin

**Query docs-management for current marketplace.json schema:**

- Keywords: "marketplace.json", "marketplace plugins array", "plugin entry schema"
- This ensures you use the current format (schema may evolve)

**Common oversight:** Creating a plugin but forgetting to add it to marketplace.json - the plugin will exist but be invisible to users.

### Component Registration in plugin.json (CRITICAL)

**⚠️ ALWAYS check plugin.json when adding new agents, commands, or skills** - the manifest may use explicit arrays instead of directory auto-discovery.

**Two Registration Modes:**

| Mode | plugin.json Syntax | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Directory (auto-discovery)** | `"agents": "./agents"` | All `.md` files in directory are loaded automatically |
| **Explicit array** | `"agents": ["./agents/foo.md", "./agents/bar.md"]` | ONLY listed files are loaded - new files IGNORED |

**When to register manually:**

1. Check `plugin.json` for the component type you're adding
2. If it's an **explicit array** → Add your new file to the array
3. If it's a **directory path** → No action needed (auto-discovered)

**Common oversight:** Creating a new agent file but forgetting to add it to the `agents` array in `plugin.json` - the file will exist but the agent won't load (silent failure, no error message).

**Example (explicit array):**

```json
{
  "agents": [
    "./agents/existing-agent.md",
    "./agents/new-agent.md"  // <-- ADD THIS LINE
  ]
}
```

**Why this matters:** Claude Code v2.1.x doesn't provide error messages when agents aren't registered - they simply don't appear in the available agents list.

### Plugin Data Locations (Two-Location Architecture)

> **Documentation Verification:** Query `docs-management: "plugin cache plugin storage locations"` for current
> Claude Code plugin data locations. The paths below were accurate at time of writing but may change between releases.

**IMPORTANT:** Plugin data is stored in TWO locations. Both must be cleared for a complete reset:

| Location | Contains | Cleared By |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `~/.claude/plugins/` | Plugin cache, registry, marketplace cache | `/clear-plugin-cache` (partial), `/user-config:reset-plugins` (complete) |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` → `enabledPlugins` | Plugin enable/disable state | `/user-config:reset-plugins` only |

**Common Confusion:** `/clear-plugin-cache` only clears the cache directory, preserving the registry. If you see "Plugin not found in marketplace" errors after cache clearing, the `enabledPlugins` in settings.json still references the old plugins.

**Solution:** Use `/user-config:reset-plugins` for complete plugin reset.

### Settings Integration

- enabledPlugins configuration
- extraKnownMarketplaces configuration
- Plugin-related settings in settings.json

### Plugin Hook Configuration (Repository-Specific)

Plugin hooks are automatically merged when a plugin is enabled. Unlike local hooks (`.claude/hooks/`), plugin hooks use **environment variables** for consumer control:

**Environment Variable Convention:**

| Variable | Values | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CLAUDE_HOOK_{NAME}_ENABLED` | `1`/`true` (enabled), `0`/`false` (disabled) | Enable/disable hook |
| `CLAUDE_HOOK_ENFORCEMENT_{NAME}` | `block`, `warn`, `log` | Control enforcement behavior |
| `CLAUDE_HOOK_LOG_LEVEL` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` | Logging verbosity |

**Consumer Configuration via settings.json:**

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_HOOK_MARKDOWN_LINT_ENABLED": "1",
    "CLAUDE_HOOK_ENFORCEMENT_SECRET_SCAN": "warn"
  }
}
```

**For Plugin Authors:** See [Plugin Hook Utilities Reference](references/plugin-hook-utilities.md)
**For Plugin Consumers:** See [Consumer Configuration Reference](references/plugin-hook-consumer-config.md)

## Delegation Patterns

### Standard Query Pattern

```text
User asks: "How do I create a plugin?"

1. Invoke docs-management skill
2. Use keywords: "plugin quickstart", "create plugin"
3. Load official documentation
4. Provide guidance based EXCLUSIVELY on official docs
```

### Multi-Topic Query Pattern

```text
User asks: "I want to create a plugin with commands, hooks, and MCP servers"

1. Invoke docs-management skill with multiple queries:
   - "plugin structure", "plugin.json"
   - "plugin commands", "commands directory plugins"
   - "plugin hooks", "hooks.json plugins"
   - "MCP servers plugins", ".mcp.json plugins"
2. Synthesize guidance from official documentation
```

### Troubleshooting Pattern

```text
User reports: "My plugin commands aren't showing up"

1. Invoke docs-management skill
2. Use keywords: "debug plugin issues", "verify plugin installation"
3. Check official docs for plugin structure requirements
4. Guide user through debugging based on official docs
```

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Issue | Keywords for docs-management |
| --- | --- |
| Plugin not installing | "/plugin command", "plugin install" |
| Commands not appearing | "plugin commands", "verify plugin installation" |
| Agents not available | "plugin agents", "agents directory plugins" |
| Hooks not triggering | "plugin hooks", "hooks.json plugins" |
| Marketplace not found | "marketplace add", "plugin marketplaces" |
| Team plugins not syncing | "team plugin workflows", "automatic plugin installation" |
| Plugin structure invalid | "plugin structure", "debug plugin issues" |
| MCP server not starting | "MCP servers plugins", "CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT" |
| Custom paths not loading | "component path fields", "path behavior rules" |
| Plugin validation errors | "claude plugin validate", "plugin validation" |
| Hook not running | Check CLAUDE_HOOK_{NAME}_ENABLED env var in settings.json |
| Hook enforcement wrong | Check CLAUDE_HOOK_ENFORCEMENT_{NAME} env var in settings.json |
| "hooks: must end with .json" | hooks field must be file path (e.g., "./hooks.json"), not directory |
| "Name is reserved" error | See [Reserved Marketplace Names Reference](references/reserved-marketplace-names.md) |
| Plugin not showing in /plugin | Check if registered in marketplace.json - see [Marketplace Registration](#marketplace-registration-critical) |
| Plugin errors after clearing cache | Plugin data in TWO locations: `~/.claude/plugins/` AND `enabledPlugins` in `~/.claude/settings.json` - use `/user-config:reset-plugins` for complete reset |

## Repository-Specific Notes

This repository does not currently use plugins. Plugin documentation is relevant for:

- Understanding how plugins extend Claude Code functionality
- Potential future plugin development for this repository
- Understanding plugin-based distribution of commands, agents, skills, and hooks

When working with plugin topics, always use the docs-management skill to access official documentation.

### Reserved Marketplace Names

See [Reserved Marketplace Names Reference](references/reserved-marketplace-names.md) for:

- Known reserved names that cause "Name is reserved" errors
- How to fix marketplace.json when encountering this error
- Migration guidance for existing installations

## Auditing Plugins

This skill provides the validation criteria used by the `plugin-component-auditor` agent for formal audits.

### Audit Resources

| Resource | Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Audit Framework | `references/audit-framework.md` | Query guides and scoring criteria |

### Scoring Categories

| Category | Points | Key Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manifest Structure | 25 | Valid plugin.json, required fields |
| Component Organization | 25 | Proper directories for all components |
| Namespace Compliance | 20 | Consistent naming, no conflicts |
| Documentation | 15 | README, descriptions, examples |
| Distribution Readiness | 15 | Version, marketplace requirements |

**Thresholds:** 85+ = PASS, 70-84 = PASS WITH WARNINGS, <70 = FAIL

### Related Agent

The `plugin-component-auditor` agent (Haiku model) performs formal audits using this skill:

- Auto-loads this skill via `skills: plugin-development`
- Uses audit framework and docs-management for rules
- Generates structured audit reports
- Invoked by `/audit-plugins` command

### External Technology Validation

When auditing plugins that use external technologies (scripts, packages, runtimes), the auditor MUST validate claims using MCP servers before flagging findings.

**Technologies Requiring MCP Validation:**

- .NET/C# scripts: Validate with microsoft-learn + perplexity
- Node.js/npm packages: Validate with context7 + perplexity
- Python scripts/packages: Validate with context7 + perplexity
- Shell scripts: Validate with perplexity
- Any version-specific claims: ALWAYS validate with perplexity

**Validation Rule:**

Never flag a technology usage as incorrect without first:

1. Querying appropriate MCP server(s) for current documentation
2. Verifying with perplexity for recent changes (especially .NET 10+)
3. Documenting MCP sources in the finding

**Stale Data Warning:**

- microsoft-learn can return cached/outdated documentation
- ALWAYS pair microsoft-learn with perplexity for version verification
- Trust perplexity for version numbers and recently-released features
