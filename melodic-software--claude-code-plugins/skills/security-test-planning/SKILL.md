# Security Test Planning

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- **Security Test Planning tasks** - Planning security testing strategies for applications
- **Planning or design** - Need guidance on OWASP testing, pen test scoping, SAST/DAST
- **Best practices** - Want to follow established security testing standards

## Overview

Security testing validates that applications are protected against threats and vulnerabilities. A comprehensive security test strategy combines automated scanning, manual testing, and threat-based test case design.

## Quick Reference: Testing Layers

| Layer | Tools | Frequency | Gate |
|-------|-------|-----------|------|
| Layer 1 (CI/CD) | Gitleaks, SonarQube, Snyk, Trivy | Every commit | Block Critical |
| Layer 2 (Periodic) | OWASP ZAP, Burp, 42Crunch | Weekly/Release | Block High+ |
| Layer 3 (Manual) | Penetration testing, Code review | Quarterly | Block All |

## OWASP Top 10 Quick Coverage

| Category | Testing Approach |
|----------|------------------|
| A01: Broken Access Control | Manual + Automated |
| A02: Cryptographic Failures | Code review + SAST |
| A03: Injection | SAST + DAST + Manual |
| A04: Insecure Design | Threat modeling |
| A05: Security Misconfiguration | Config scanning |
| A06: Vulnerable Components | SCA |
| A07: Auth Failures | Manual + Automated |
| A08: Data Integrity | Manual testing |
| A09: Logging Failures | Log review |
| A10: SSRF | DAST + Manual |

## Remediation SLAs

| Severity | SLA | Verification |
|----------|-----|--------------|
| Critical | 24 hours | Immediate retest |
| High | 7 days | Next sprint retest |
| Medium | 30 days | Quarterly scan |
| Low | 90 days | Annual review |

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Planning security test strategy

**Query:** "Help me create a security test plan for our web application"

**Expected:** Skill activates, provides strategy template, guides through scope and layers

### Scenario 2: OWASP-aligned testing

**Query:** "What OWASP tests should I run for authentication?"

**Expected:** Skill activates, loads owasp-testing.md reference, provides WSTG-ATHN tests

### Scenario 3: .NET security tests

**Query:** "Show me how to test for SQL injection in .NET"

**Expected:** Skill activates, loads dotnet-security-tests.md reference, provides code examples
