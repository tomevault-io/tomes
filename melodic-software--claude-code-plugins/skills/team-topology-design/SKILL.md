# Team Topologies Design

A modern approach to team organization that optimizes for fast flow of change while managing cognitive load.

## When to Use This Skill

**Keywords:** team topologies, stream-aligned, platform, enabling, complicated subsystem, interaction mode, collaboration, x-as-a-service, facilitating, cognitive load, Inverse Conway, Conway's Law, team API, team boundaries, fast flow

**Use this skill when:**

- Designing or reorganizing team structures
- Aligning teams with software architecture
- Reducing cognitive load on teams
- Improving flow of change delivery
- Applying Inverse Conway Maneuver
- Defining team interactions and boundaries
- Planning organizational evolution

## Conway's Law

> "Any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure."
> — Melvin Conway, 1968

### Implications

```yaml
conways_law:
  observation: "Architecture mirrors communication structures"

  implications:
    - "Team structure shapes system architecture"
    - "Siloed teams create siloed systems"
    - "Cross-functional teams create integrated systems"
    - "Team boundaries become system boundaries"

  inverse_conway:
    principle: "Design the organization to match the desired architecture"
    approach: "If you want a certain system architecture, structure teams accordingly"
    warning: "Architecture and team structure will drift back together over time"
```

## The Four Team Types

### 1. Stream-Aligned Team

```yaml
stream_aligned:
  definition: "Team aligned to a single, valuable stream of work"

  characteristics:
    - "End-to-end responsibility for a flow of value"
    - "Cross-functional (dev, ops, test, UX, etc.)"
    - "Long-lived, product-focused"
    - "Owns one or more bounded contexts"
    - "Primary team type (majority of teams)"

  size: "5-9 members"

  examples:
    - "Customer onboarding team"
    - "Checkout experience team"
    - "Mobile app team"
    - "B2B integration team"

  owns:
    - "Customer-facing features"
    - "Specific user journeys"
    - "Bounded context(s)"
    - "Full software lifecycle"

  does_not_own:
    - "Shared infrastructure"
    - "Complex specialist components"
    - "Cross-cutting capabilities"

  success_metrics:
    - "Lead time for changes"
    - "Deployment frequency"
    - "Customer satisfaction"
    - "Time to restore service"
```

### 2. Platform Team

```yaml
platform_team:
  definition: "Team providing internal services to reduce cognitive load on stream-aligned teams"

  characteristics:
    - "Treats internal teams as customers"
    - "Provides self-service capabilities"
    - "Focuses on developer experience"
    - "Operates as internal product team"
    - "Reduces duplication across teams"

  size: "5-9 members (can scale with platform size)"

```

### 3. Enabling Team

```yaml
enabling_team:
  definition: "Team helping stream-aligned teams adopt new capabilities"

  characteristics:
    - "Temporary engagement with other teams"
    - "Upskills rather than builds"
    - "Identifies patterns and best practices"

    follow_up: "Periodic check-ins"

  success_metrics:
    - "Capability adoption rate"
    - "Time to team independence"
    - "Practice spread across org"
```

### 4. Complicated Subsystem Team

```yaml

## The Three Interaction Modes

### Collaboration

  characteristics:
    - "Clear API/contract"
    - "Minimal coordination needed"
    - "Provider team owns service evolution"

  engagement_cycle:
    assess: "Understand team needs"
    teach: "Active coaching/training"
    support: "Available for questions"
    exit: "Team is self-sufficient"

  anti_patterns:
    - "Permanent dependency"
    - "Doing work for them"
    - "Gatekeeping knowledge"
```

## Cognitive Load

### Types of Cognitive Load

```yaml
cognitive_load_types:
  intrinsic:
    definition: "Load from the problem space itself"
    examples:
      - "Business domain complexity"
      - "Technical complexity of task"
      - "Regulatory requirements"
    strategy: "Can't eliminate, but can train for it"

  extraneous:
    definition: "Load from environment/process"
    examples:
      - "Legacy system quirks"
      - "Poor tooling"
      - "Unclear requirements"
    strategy: "Minimize through platforms, automation"

  germane:
    definition: "Load from learning and growing"
    examples:
      - "Learning new technologies"
      - "Exploring new domains"
      - "Building mental models"
    strategy: "Invest in this - it builds capability"
```

### Cognitive Load Assessment

```yaml
cognitive_load_assessment:
  questions:
    domain_complexity:
      - "How many domains does the team own?"
      - "How deep is the domain knowledge required?"
      - "How often do domain rules change?"

    technical_complexity:
      - "How many systems does the team maintain?"
      - "What's the technology diversity?"
      - "How much legacy code exists?"

    environmental_friction:
      - "How much time spent on non-value work?"
      - "How many other teams must be coordinated with?"
      - "How painful is the deployment process?"

  scoring:
    1_3: "Manageable - team can focus on value"
    4_6: "Elevated - some overhead impacting flow"
    7_9: "Overloaded - need to reduce scope"
    10: "Critical - team cannot function effectively"

  red_flags:
    - "Team owns more than 3 bounded contexts"
    - "More than 50% time on coordination"
    - "High defect rate from context switching"
    - "Burnout indicators"
```

### Team Size Heuristics

```yaml
team_sizing:
  dunbar_numbers:
    5: "Core working group"
    15: "Extended team with coordination"
    50: "Department boundary"
    150: "Organization boundary"

  two_pizza_rule:
    description: "Team should be fed by two pizzas"
    practical_size: "5-9 members"
    rationale: "Communication overhead grows exponentially"

  brooks_law:
    statement: "Adding people to late project makes it later"
    implication: "Teams should be right-sized from start"
```

## Inverse Conway Maneuver

### Principle

```yaml
inverse_conway:
  definition: "Design organization to achieve desired architecture"

  process:
    1: "Define desired target architecture"
    2: "Identify bounded contexts and their relationships"
    3: "Design team structure to mirror desired architecture"
    4: "Allow teams to evolve the architecture they own"

  example:
    desired_architecture: "Independent microservices with clear boundaries"
    team_design: "Stream-aligned teams owning 1-2 services each"
    platform: "Shared infrastructure as platform team"
    result: "Architecture naturally evolves to match team structure"
```

### Implementation Steps

|---------|-------------|----------------|-----|
| {Service} | {What it does} | {Channel} | {Response time} |

## What We Own
- {Bounded context(s)}
- {Systems/repos}
- {Documentation location}

## Interaction Preferences
- **Preferred contact:** {Slack channel, email, etc.}
- **Office hours:** {When available for synchronous discussion}
- **Request process:** {How to make requests}

```

## Team Evolution Patterns

### Evolution Triggers

```yaml
evolution_triggers:
  growing_load:
    signal: "Team cognitive load increasing"
    options:
      - "Split team along bounded contexts"
      - "Create platform team for shared concerns"
      - "Spin off complicated subsystem"

  maturing_collaboration:
    signal: "Collaboration mode lasting too long"
    action: "Transition to X-as-a-Service"

  repeated_enablement:
    signal: "Same capability needed by multiple teams"
    action: "Move to platform team"

  specialist_bottleneck:
    signal: "Specialist knowledge creating bottleneck"
    options:
      - "Create complicated subsystem team"
      - "Enable teams to build capability"
```

```yaml
team_splitting:
  when_to_split:
    - "Team owns too many bounded contexts (>3)"
    - "Cognitive load consistently high"
    - "Team size exceeding 9"
    - "Clear domain boundary exists"

  how_to_split:
    identify_boundary: "Find natural seam in domain/code"
    ensure_viability: "Each new team must be viable alone"
    plan_transition: "Gradual handoff, not big bang"
    maintain_interfaces: "Keep X-as-a-Service with old team"

  anti_patterns:
    - "Splitting by technology layer (UI team, API team)"
    - "Splitting without clear ownership"
    - "Creating too many tiny teams"
```

### Team Merging

```yaml
team_merging:
  when_to_merge:
    - "Too much collaboration overhead"
    - "Teams too small to be effective"
    - "Bounded contexts closely related"
    - "Artificial boundaries causing friction"

  how_to_merge:
    assess_fit: "Will combined load be manageable?"
    plan_integration: "How will skills combine?"
    redefine_scope: "New team's bounded context(s)"
    update_interactions: "Revise team API"
```
