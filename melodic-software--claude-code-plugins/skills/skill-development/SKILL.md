# Skills Meta

## 🚨 MANDATORY: Invoke docs-management First

> **STOP - Before providing ANY response about Claude Code skills or slash commands:**
>
> 1. **INVOKE** `docs-management` skill
> 2. **QUERY** using keywords: skills, skill creation, YAML frontmatter, progressive disclosure, skill best practices, slash commands, command frontmatter, or related topics
> 3. **BASE** all responses EXCLUSIVELY on official documentation loaded
>
> **Skipping this step results in outdated or incorrect information.**

### Verification Checkpoint

Before responding, verify:

- [ ] Did I invoke docs-management skill?
- [ ] Did official documentation load?
- [ ] Is my response based EXCLUSIVELY on official docs?

If ANY checkbox is unchecked, STOP and invoke docs-management first.

## Overview

This meta-skill provides workflows, templates, keyword registries, and patterns for working with Claude Code skills and slash commands. Since v2.1.3+, slash commands and skills are unified -- both are invoked via the `Skill` tool. This skill covers both. It does NOT duplicate official documentation - instead, it teaches you how to efficiently query the `docs-management` skill for any skills or commands-related information you need.

**What this skill provides:**

- Skill template (5 structural patterns to choose from)
- Creation and validation workflows
- Keyword registry for efficient documentation lookups (skills and commands)
- Naming conventions and common patterns
- Quick decision trees for navigation
- Slash command keyword registry, decision tree, and troubleshooting

**What this skill does NOT provide:**

- Duplicated official documentation (use `docs-management` skill instead)
- YAML frontmatter specifications (query `docs-management`)
- Progressive disclosure details (query `docs-management`)
- Complete best practices lists (query `docs-management`)

2. **Query Official Docs:** Load current requirements from docs-management
3. **Complete TODOs:** Fill in frontmatter, content, examples
4. **Validate:** Check frontmatter, naming, structure, activation

**Full workflow:** [references/workflows/creating-skills-workflow.md](references/workflows/creating-skills-workflow.md)

## Validating Skills Workflow (Quick Reference)

**YAML Frontmatter:**

- `name`: Lowercase, hyphens only, max 64 chars, matches directory
- `description`: Max 1024 chars, includes what + when to use

**Naming Convention:** Use "The Sentence Test" - "I'm going to reach for the [skill-name] skill" should sound natural

**Activation Testing:** Test with direct mention, domain mention, task mention, file type mention

**Full workflow:** [references/workflows/validating-skills-workflow.md](references/workflows/validating-skills-workflow.md)

## Auditing Skills Workflow (Quick Reference)

**Use `/audit-skills` command for automated auditing:**

- Single skill: `/audit-skills skill-name`
- Multiple skills: `/audit-skills skill-1 skill-2`
- All skills: `/audit-skills --all`
- Smart prioritization: `/audit-skills --smart`

**Manual audit checklist:** [references/quality/skill-audit-guide.md](references/quality/skill-audit-guide.md)

### External Technology Validation

When auditing skills that reference external technologies (scripts, packages, runtimes), the auditor MUST validate claims using MCP servers before flagging findings.

**Technologies Requiring MCP Validation:**

- .NET/C# scripts: Validate with microsoft-learn + perplexity
- Node.js/npm packages: Validate with context7 + perplexity
- Python scripts/packages: Validate with context7 + perplexity
- Shell scripts: Validate with perplexity
- Any version-specific claims: ALWAYS validate with perplexity

**Validation Rule:**

Never flag a technology usage as incorrect without first:

1. Querying appropriate MCP server(s) for current documentation
2. Verifying with perplexity for recent changes (especially .NET 10+)
3. Documenting MCP sources in the finding

**Stale Data Warning:**

- microsoft-learn can return cached/outdated documentation
- ALWAYS pair microsoft-learn with perplexity for version verification
- Trust perplexity for version numbers and recently-released features

## SKILL.md Length Guidance

**Official Recommendation:** Keep SKILL.md body under 500 lines for optimal performance.

**This is GUIDANCE, not a hard rule.** The 500-line recommendation exists because:

1. Context window is a shared resource (competes with conversation history, other skills)
2. Concise skills load faster and use fewer tokens
3. Progressive disclosure prevents token bloat

**When exceeding 500 lines may be acceptable:**

- Complex skills with genuinely essential content (no fluff)
- Domain-specific skills where core workflows require detail
- Skills where splitting would harm usability or add navigation overhead

**Tradeoff Framework:**

| Factor | Stay Under 500 | Exceed If Necessary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Content type | Platform-specific, examples, troubleshooting | Core workflows, critical requirements |
| Loading frequency | Rarely used sections | Always needed on every invocation |
| Alternative | Can extract to references/ | Extraction would harm usability |
| Token cost | High (verbose explanations) | Low (essential, concise content) |

**Decision Rule:** If content is needed on EVERY skill invocation AND cannot be made more concise, it may stay in SKILL.md even if it exceeds 500 lines. Conditional content should ALWAYS go to references/.

**Query docs-management for current official guidance:**

```text
Find SKILL.md size recommendations and token budget guidance
```

## Common Patterns

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern

Load content in layers: Metadata → SKILL.md body → references/ files

**Key Context Clues for Good Progressive Disclosure:**

1. **Clear reference links**: Each reference file should have explicit pointers from SKILL.md
2. **Descriptive filenames**: Use names like `troubleshooting.md`, `platform-windows.md` (not `doc1.md`)
3. **When-to-load guidance**: SKILL.md should indicate when each reference is needed
4. **One level deep**: References should NOT link to other references (Claude may use `head -100` for nested files)
5. **Table of contents**: Reference files over 100 lines should have a TOC at the top

**Example of good context clues:**

```markdown
## Advanced Features

**For form filling workflows**: See [FORMS.md](FORMS.md) - load when user mentions forms, fillable PDFs
**For API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) - load for method signatures, parameters
**For troubleshooting**: See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) - load on errors, failures
```

**Query docs-management for complete guidance:**

```text
Find documentation about progressive disclosure patterns for skills
```

### Skill Composition Pattern

Skills can invoke other skills for modular architectures.

**Example:** "Find and use the current-date skill to get today's date"

**Query docs-management for composition details:**

```text
Find documentation about skill composition and skills invoking other skills
```

### Tool Restriction Pattern

Use `allowed-tools` to limit Claude's capabilities within a skill (read-only analysis, audit workflows, safety-critical operations).

**Example:**

```yaml
---
name: readonly-analyzer
description: Analyze code without modifications
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---
```

**Query docs-management for complete specification:**

```text
Find documentation about allowed-tools configuration and tool restrictions
```

## Troubleshooting Activation

**Skill doesn't activate:**

1. Check description specificity (add trigger keywords)
2. Verify YAML syntax (opening/closing `---`, valid YAML)
3. Confirm file paths (correct directory structure)
4. Test with direct invocation ("Use the [skill-name] skill to...")
5. Check for conflicts (make descriptions distinct)

**Query docs-management for troubleshooting:**

```text
Find documentation about skill activation issues and troubleshooting
```

## Skill Template

**Location:** `assets/skill-template/`

**5 Structural Patterns:**

1. **Workflow-Based** - Sequential processes
2. **Task-Based** - Collections of operations
3. **Reference-Based** - Guidelines and standards
4. **Capabilities-Based** - Integrated features
5. **Validation Feedback Loop** - Operations requiring correctness

**Usage:**

```bash
cp -r .claude/skills/skill-development/assets/skill-template .claude/skills/[new-skill-name]
```

## Best Practices Summary

**DO:**

- ✅ Query `docs-management` skill for all official documentation
- ✅ Use the skill template for new skills
- ✅ Write specific descriptions with trigger keywords
- ✅ Test activation with varied phrasings
- ✅ Use progressive disclosure (SKILL.md → references/)
- ✅ Follow naming conventions (gerund or noun, avoid agent nouns)

**DON'T:**

- ❌ Duplicate official documentation
- ❌ Create mega-skills that do too much
- ❌ Use vague descriptions
- ❌ Skip activation testing
- ❌ Use uppercase or special characters in skill names

**For complete best practices:**

Query `docs-management`:

```text
Find the complete skill authoring best practices documentation
```
