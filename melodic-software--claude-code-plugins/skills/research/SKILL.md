# Research Command

Research domain knowledge using MCP servers to enrich requirements elicitation.

## Usage

```bash
/requirements-elicitation:research "e-commerce checkout best practices"
/requirements-elicitation:research "GDPR compliance" --domain "user-data" --depth deep
/requirements-elicitation:research "authentication patterns" --focus regulatory
/requirements-elicitation:research "competitor features" --focus competitive
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| topic | Yes | The topic to research |
| --domain | No | Domain name for organizing output |
| --depth | No | Research depth: `shallow`, `moderate`, `deep` (default: `moderate`) |
| --focus | No | Research focus: `best-practices`, `regulatory`, `competitive`, `technical`, `all` |

## Research Capabilities

### Best Practices Research

- Industry standards
- Common patterns
- Recommended approaches
- Lessons learned

### Regulatory Research

- Compliance requirements
- Legal obligations
- Industry regulations
- Audit requirements

### Competitive Research

- Competitor features
- Market standards
- Differentiation opportunities
- Feature gaps

### Technical Research

- Library capabilities
- Framework requirements
- Integration patterns
- Technology constraints

## Workflow

### Step 1: Parse Research Request

```yaml
research_request:
  topic: "{from argument}"
  domain: "{from --domain}"
  depth: shallow|moderate|deep
  focus: "{from --focus or all}"
```

### Step 2: Load Domain Research Skill

Invoke the `requirements-elicitation:domain-research` skill to load MCP patterns.

### Step 3: Execute MCP Queries

Based on focus area:

**Best Practices:**

```yaml
queries:
  - server: perplexity
    query: "{topic} best practices 2025"
  - server: perplexity
    query: "{topic} common patterns recommendations"
```

**Regulatory:**

```yaml
queries:
  - server: perplexity
    query: "{regulation} requirements {industry}"
  - server: firecrawl
    action: scrape regulatory documentation
```

**Competitive:**

```yaml
queries:
  - server: firecrawl
    action: search competitor features
  - server: perplexity
    query: "{industry} market leaders features"
```

**Technical:**

```yaml
queries:
  - server: context7
    action: resolve library, get docs
  - server: perplexity
    query: "{technology} integration requirements"
```

### Step 4: Synthesize Findings

Combine research results:

- Extract key findings
- Identify requirements implications
- Note confidence levels
- Flag items needing validation

### Step 5: Save and Report

Save to `.requirements/{domain}/research/`
Display summary of findings.
