# Spec Kit Workflow

GitHub Spec Kit 5-phase specification-driven development workflow.

## When to Use This Skill

**Keywords:** Spec Kit, 5-phase workflow, constitution, specify, plan, tasks, implement, feature.md, design.md, tasks.md, specification workflow, GitHub Spec Kit, constitution.md, phased development

**Use this skill when:**

- Implementing specification-driven development workflows
- Creating or updating project constitution files
- Generating feature specifications from requirements
- Creating implementation plans from specifications
- Breaking down plans into task lists
- Following the full Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement cycle

## Workflow Overview

```text
Phase 0: Constitution (One-time setup)
    ↓
Phase 1: Specify (Generate feature.md)
    ↓
Phase 2: Plan (Generate design.md)
    ↓
Phase 3: Tasks (Generate tasks.md)
    ↓
Phase 4: Implement (Code with guidance)
```

## Phase 0: Constitution

### Purpose

Establish project-wide principles, constraints, and non-functional requirements that guide ALL specifications.

### File: `.constitution.md`

```markdown
# Project Constitution

## Core Principles
- <principle 1>
- <principle 2>

## Technical Constraints
- <constraint 1>
- <constraint 2>

## Quality Standards
- <standard 1>
- <standard 2>

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: <requirement>
- Security: <requirement>
- Accessibility: <requirement>
```

### Constitution Checklist

- [ ] Core development principles defined
- [ ] Technical constraints documented
- [ ] Quality standards specified
- [ ] Non-functional requirements listed
- [ ] Team conventions captured
- [ ] Dependencies and integration requirements noted

### When to Update

Update the constitution when:

- New non-functional requirements emerge
- Team conventions change
- Architectural decisions impact all features
- Project-wide constraints are added

## Phase 1: Specify

### Purpose

Transform a feature request or user story into a structured specification with EARS requirements and acceptance criteria.

### Input

- Feature request (natural language)
- User story (As a... I want... So that...)
- Problem statement

### Output: `feature.md`

```markdown
# Feature: <Feature Name>

## Context
### Problem Statement
<What problem does this solve?>

### Motivation
<Why is this important?>

### Scope
<What's in/out of scope?>

## Requirements

### REQ-001: <Requirement Title>
**EARS Pattern:** <ubiquitous|state-driven|event-driven|unwanted|optional>
**Priority:** <must|should|could>
**Text:** <EARS-formatted requirement>

#### Acceptance Criteria
- **AC-001:**
  - Given: <precondition>
  - When: <action>
  - Then: <outcome>

### REQ-002: ...

## Dependencies
- <dependency 1>
- <dependency 2>

## Risks
- <risk 1>

## Phase 2: Plan

### Purpose

Design the technical implementation approach for the specified feature.

### Data Model
<Entities, relationships, schema changes>

### API Design
<Endpoints, contracts, interfaces>

## Technical Approach

### Approach Selected
<Chosen approach with rationale>

### Alternatives Considered
| Alternative | Pros | Cons | Why Not |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <alt 1> | ... | ... | ... |

## Integration Points
- <integration 1>
- <integration 2>

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: <approach>
- Integration tests: <approach>
- E2E tests: <approach>

## Rollout Plan
<How will this be deployed?>
```

### Plan Phase Checklist

## Phase 3: Tasks

### Purpose

Break down the design into implementable tasks with clear deliverables.

### Input

- `design.md` from Phase 2
- `feature.md` requirements for traceability

### Output: `tasks.md`

````markdown
# Tasks: <Feature Name>

## Task List

### TSK-001: <Task Title>
**Status:** pending
**Requirement:** REQ-001
**Estimated Effort:** <S|M|L|XL>

**Description:**
<What needs to be done>

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] <deliverable 1>
- [ ] <deliverable 2>

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] <criterion 1>
- [ ] <criterion 2>

### TSK-002: ...

## Dependency Graph

```text
TSK-001 → TSK-003
TSK-002 → TSK-003
TSK-003 → TSK-004
```
