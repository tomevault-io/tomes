# GameDay Planning

Comprehensive guide for planning and executing GameDay exercises - organized chaos drills that test system resilience and incident response.

## When to Use This Skill

- Planning GameDay exercises
- Designing failure scenarios
- Preparing teams for chaos experiments
- Running disaster recovery drills
- Improving incident response readiness

## What is a GameDay?

```text
GameDay = Planned chaos exercise for your systems

Like a fire drill, but for infrastructure:
- Scheduled in advance
- Controlled environment
- Practice for real incidents
- Learn and improve

Not chaos engineering:
- GameDay: Scheduled team exercise
- Chaos engineering: Continuous experiments

GameDays include:
- Failure injection
- Incident response practice
- Team coordination
- Runbook validation
```

## GameDay Types

### By Scope

```text
1. Component GameDay
   └── Single service or component
   └── Focused scenarios
   └── 2-4 hours

2. Service GameDay
   └── Multiple related services
   └── Integration scenarios
   └── Half day

3. Full System GameDay
   └── Complete system
   └── Disaster scenarios
   └── Full day

4. Cross-Team GameDay
   └── Multiple teams involved
   └── Complex scenarios
   └── 1-2 days
```

### By Objective

```text
1. Resilience validation
   └── Does the system handle failures?

2. Recovery practice
   └── Can we restore from backup?

3. Incident response training
   └── How well do we coordinate?

4. Runbook validation
   └── Do our runbooks work?

5. Capacity testing
   └── What happens under load?
```

### Objective Setting

```text
Good objectives:
- "Validate failover to secondary region works < 5 minutes"
- "Confirm team can diagnose database issues using runbooks"
- "Test load balancer behavior when 50% of nodes fail"

Bad objectives:

```

### Handling Real Incidents

```text
If real incident occurs during GameDay:

1. STOP GameDay immediately
   "GameDay paused - real incident"

2. Assess the real incident
   Is it related to GameDay?

3. Revert any GameDay changes
   If potentially contributing

4. Handle real incident
   Normal incident process

5. Decide on continuation
   Resume or reschedule GameDay?

Always prioritize real incidents over GameDay.
```

## Follow-Up Phase

### Hot Debrief

```text
Immediately after GameDay:

Duration: 30-60 minutes
Participants: All GameDay participants

Agenda:
1. What happened? (5 min per scenario)
   - Timeline walk-through
   - Key observations

2. What worked well?
   - Celebrate successes
   - Note effective practices

3. What didn't work?
   - Issues discovered
   - Gaps in tools/process

4. Initial action items
   - Quick fixes
   - Further investigation needed

5. Next steps
   - Postmortem schedule
   - Owner assignments
```

### Formal Postmortem

```text
Within 1 week of GameDay:

   First GameDay should be simple

2. Clear objectives
   Know what you're testing

3. Stakeholder buy-in
   Get approval and support

4. Thorough preparation
   Don't rush the prep work

5. Documented scenarios
   Written plans, not in heads
```

### Execution

```text
1. Safety first
   Kill switches ready

2. Communicate constantly
   Everyone knows what's happening

3. Document everything
   You'll forget otherwise

4. Stay on schedule
   Don't let scenarios run over

5. Be flexible
   Adapt to unexpected situations
```

### Follow-Up

```text
1. Debrief immediately
   Hot debrief same day

2. Formal postmortem
   Within a week

3. Track action items
   Don't let them die

4. Share learnings
   Spread knowledge broadly

5. Plan the next one
   Make it a regular practice
```
