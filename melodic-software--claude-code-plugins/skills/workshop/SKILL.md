# Workshop Command

Facilitate structured requirements workshops following Joint Application Development (JAD) patterns.

## Interactive Workshop Configuration

Use AskUserQuestion to configure the workshop session:

```yaml
# Question 1: Workshop Format (MCP: JAD methodology patterns)
question: "What type of requirements workshop do you need?"
header: "Format"
options:
  - label: "Discovery (Recommended)"
    description: "Explore and understand the problem space"
  - label: "JAD (Full)"
    description: "Comprehensive requirements definition with all stakeholders"

## Example Session

```text
/requirements-elicitation:workshop --domain "expense-management" --format discovery

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
REQUIREMENTS WORKSHOP: expense-management
Format: Discovery Workshop
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

📋 AGENDA
1. Problem Statement (20 min)
2. Stakeholder Mapping (20 min)
3. Current State Analysis (30 min)
4. Desired State Vision (30 min)
5. Gap Analysis (20 min)

─────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 1: PROBLEM STATEMENT
─────────────────────────────────────────────

Facilitator: "What problem are we solving?"

Captured problem statement:
"Employees spend excessive time on expense reporting,
finance struggles with policy compliance, and managers
lack visibility into team spending."

Impact of not solving:
• 4+ hours/month per employee on expense admin
• 15% of expense reports require rework
• Late reimbursements affect employee satisfaction
• Limited spend visibility for budgeting

─────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 2: STAKEHOLDER MAPPING
─────────────────────────────────────────────

Stakeholders identified:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ HIGH INFLUENCE                          │
│   CFO - Budget control, policy owner    │
│   Finance Team - Processing, compliance │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ HIGH INTEREST                           │
│   Employees - Submit expenses           │
│   Managers - Approve, budget visibility │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Conflicting interests noted:
• Finance wants stricter controls
• Employees want faster approval
• Managers want flexibility within budget

─────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 3: CURRENT STATE
─────────────────────────────────────────────

Current process:
1. Employee collects paper receipts
2. Fills Excel template
3. Emails to manager
4. Manager reviews, forwards to finance
5. Finance validates against policy
6. Finance processes reimbursement

Pain points:
❌ Paper receipts get lost (35% of claims)
❌ No mobile capture option
❌ Manual policy checking (error-prone)
❌ No real-time spending visibility
❌ Reimbursement takes 2-3 weeks

What works:
✓ Familiar Excel format
✓ Manager approval chain

─────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 4: DESIRED STATE
─────────────────────────────────────────────

Success vision:
"One-tap expense capture from mobile, automatic
policy validation, real-time approval workflow,
and same-week reimbursement."

Key outcomes:
• <5 min per expense report
• 0% policy violations at submission
• <3 days to reimbursement
• Real-time budget visibility

─────────────────────────────────────────────
PHASE 5: GAP ANALYSIS
─────────────────────────────────────────────

Critical gaps:
1. No mobile capture → Need mobile app
2. Manual validation → Need policy engine
3. Email workflow → Need approval system
4. No visibility → Need dashboard

Requirements emerging:
• Mobile receipt capture with OCR
• Automated policy validation
• Multi-level approval workflow
• Real-time budget dashboard
• Integration with payroll

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
WORKSHOP COMPLETE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

Summary:

• 5 desired outcomes defined ✓
• 12 requirement candidates generated ✓

Saved to: .requirements/expense-management/workshop/WS-20251226-170000.yaml

Next steps:
1. Run /simulate to validate from stakeholder perspectives
2. Run /brainstorm for additional feature ideas
3. Run /discover to formalize requirements
```

## Output Locations

```yaml
output_locations:
  report: ".requirements/{domain}/workshop/WS-{timestamp}.yaml"
  requirements: ".requirements/{domain}/workshop/requirements-{timestamp}.yaml"
  decisions: ".requirements/{domain}/workshop/decisions-{timestamp}.yaml"
```

## Integration with Other Commands

### Before Workshop

```bash
# Gather context
/requirements-elicitation:research --domain "expenses"

# Review existing requirements
/requirements-elicitation:gaps --domain "expenses"
```

### After Workshop

```bash
# Validate with stakeholder simulation
/requirements-elicitation:simulate --domain "expenses"

# Prioritize captured requirements
/requirements-elicitation:prioritize --domain "expenses" --method moscow

# Export to formal format
/requirements-elicitation:export --domain "expenses" --format ears
```

## Error Handling

```yaml
error_handling:
  insufficient_context:
    message: "Not enough context for workshop"
    action: "Run /research or /discover first"

  no_stakeholders:
    message: "No stakeholder perspectives available"
    action: "Run /simulate to create personas first"
```
