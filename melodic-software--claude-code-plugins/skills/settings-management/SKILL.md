## Delegation Patterns

### Standard Query Pattern

```text
User asks: "How do I configure permissions?"

1. Invoke docs-management skill
2. Use keywords: "permission settings", "allow deny rules"
3. Load official documentation
4. Provide guidance based EXCLUSIVELY on official docs
```

### Multi-Topic Query Pattern

```text
User asks: "I want enterprise settings with sandbox and restricted permissions"

1. Invoke docs-management skill with multiple queries:
   - "managed-settings.json", "enterprise managed policy"
   - "sandbox settings", "bash sandboxing"
   - "permission settings", "deny rules"
2. Synthesize guidance from official documentation
```

### Troubleshooting Pattern

```text
User reports: "My settings aren't taking effect"

1. Invoke docs-management skill
2. Use keywords: "settings precedence", "configuration hierarchy"
3. Guide user through precedence rules from official docs
```

When modifying this repository's settings, ensure changes align with the hook-management skill guidance for hook configurations.

## Auditing Settings

This skill provides the validation criteria used by the `settings-auditor` agent for formal audits.

### Audit Resources

| Resource | Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Audit Framework | `references/audit-framework.md` | Query guides and scoring criteria |

### Scoring Categories

| Category | Points | Key Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JSON Validity | 20 | Valid syntax, well-formed |
| Schema Compliance | 25 | Only valid settings options |
| Permission Rules | 25 | Valid patterns, appropriate restrictions |
| Environment Config | 15 | Valid env vars, no secrets |
| Precedence Awareness | 15 | Correct scope usage |

**Thresholds:** 85+ = PASS, 70-84 = PASS WITH WARNINGS, <70 = FAIL

### Related Agent

The `settings-auditor` agent (Haiku model) performs formal audits using this skill:

- Auto-loads this skill via `skills: settings-management`
- Uses audit framework and docs-management for rules
- Generates structured audit reports
- Invoked by `/audit-settings` command

### External Technology Validation

When auditing settings that reference external technologies (scripts, packages, runtimes), the auditor MUST validate claims using MCP servers before flagging findings.

**Technologies Requiring MCP Validation:**

- .NET/C# scripts: Validate with microsoft-learn + perplexity
- Node.js/npm packages: Validate with context7 + perplexity
- Python scripts/packages: Validate with context7 + perplexity
- Shell scripts: Validate with perplexity
- Any version-specific claims: ALWAYS validate with perplexity

**Validation Rule:**

Never flag a technology usage as incorrect without first:

1. Querying appropriate MCP server(s) for current documentation
2. Verifying with perplexity for recent changes (especially .NET 10+)
3. Documenting MCP sources in the finding

**Stale Data Warning:**

- microsoft-learn can return cached/outdated documentation
- ALWAYS pair microsoft-learn with perplexity for version verification
- Trust perplexity for version numbers and recently-released features

## VS Code Integration

This plugin provides an extended JSON Schema for Claude Code settings that enables IntelliSense in VS Code.

### Schema Association Options

#### Option 1: Workspace Settings (Recommended)

Add to `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "json.schemas": [
    {
      "fileMatch": ["**/.claude/settings.json", "**/.claude/settings.local.json"],
      "url": "./plugins/claude-ecosystem/skills/settings-management/references/claude-code-settings.schema.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Option 2: In-File Schema Reference

Add at the top of your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melodic/claude-code-plugins/main/plugins/claude-ecosystem/skills/settings-management/references/claude-code-settings.schema.json"
}
```

**Note:** In-file `$schema` references override workspace settings. Use workspace settings for flexibility.

### Environment Variable IntelliSense

The schema includes 68+ environment variables with:

- Full autocomplete for all official env var names
- Descriptions and categories for each variable
- `enum: ["0", "1"]` for boolean flags (type safety)
- Deprecation markers for obsolete variables

**Try it:** In your `settings.json`, type `"env": { "A` and VS Code will autocomplete `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, etc.

### Schema Version

The schema tracks Claude Code versions and includes version history:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `x-schema-version` | Plugin schema version (e.g., 1.1.0) |
| `x-claude-code-version` | Claude Code version tracked |
| `x-env-var-count` | Number of env vars defined (68+) |
| `x-last-updated` | Last schema update date |

### Keeping Schema Updated

Run `/update-settings-schema` to sync the schema with latest canonical documentation. This extracts new env vars and settings from the official docs.
