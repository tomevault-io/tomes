description: Central authority for Claude Code sandboxing and isolation. Covers sandboxed bash tool, /sandbox command, filesystem isolation (blocked access, custom paths), network isolation (domain restrictions, proxy support), OS-level enforcement (bubblewrap on Linux, Seatbelt on macOS), sandbox configuration options, escape hatches (dangerouslyDisableSandbox, allowUnsandboxedCommands), and sandbox security limitations. Assists with configuring sandbox settings, understanding isolation mechanisms, and troubleshooting sandbox issues. Delegates 100% to docs-management skill for official documentation. Use when this capability is needed.

# Sandbox Configuration Skill

## MANDATORY: Invoke docs-management First

> **STOP - Before providing ANY response about Claude Code sandboxing:**
>
> 1. **INVOKE** `docs-management` skill
> 2. **QUERY** for the user's specific topic
> 3. **BASE** all responses EXCLUSIVELY on official documentation loaded
>
> **Skipping this step results in outdated or incorrect information.**

### Verification Checkpoint

Before responding, verify:

- [ ] Did I invoke docs-management skill?
- [ ] Did official documentation load?
- [ ] Is my response based EXCLUSIVELY on official docs?

If ANY checkbox is unchecked, STOP and invoke docs-management first.

## Overview

Central authority for Claude Code sandboxing and isolation. This skill uses **100% delegation to docs-management** - it contains NO duplicated official documentation.

**Architecture:** Pure delegation with keyword registry. All official documentation is accessed via docs-management skill queries.

## When to Use This Skill

**Keywords:** sandboxing, sandbox, /sandbox, filesystem isolation, network isolation, bubblewrap, Seatbelt, dangerouslyDisableSandbox, allowUnsandboxedCommands, excludedCommands, httpProxyPort, socksProxyPort, domain restrictions, sandbox configuration, blocked access

**Use this skill when:**

- Configuring sandbox settings
- Understanding filesystem isolation
- Setting up network isolation
- Troubleshooting sandbox blocking commands
- Understanding OS-level enforcement
- Configuring escape hatches
- Setting up proxy support
