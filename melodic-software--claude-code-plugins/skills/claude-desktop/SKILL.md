## Overview

Central authority for Claude Desktop - the native desktop application for running Claude Code sessions locally or on cloud infrastructure. This skill uses **100% delegation to docs-management** - it contains NO duplicated official documentation.

**Architecture:** Pure delegation with keyword registry. All official documentation is accessed via docs-management skill queries.

## When to Use This Skill

**Keywords:** Claude Desktop, desktop app, desktop application, worktree, worktrees, .worktreeinclude, parallel sessions, cloud session, cloud execution, remote environment, desktop extensions, .mcpb, MCP bundle, bundled version, claude.ai/download, Desktop vs CLI

**Use this skill when:**

- Installing or setting up Claude Desktop
- Configuring Git worktrees for parallel sessions
- Creating .worktreeinclude files
- Starting cloud sessions from Desktop
- Configuring environment variables in Desktop
- Installing Desktop Extensions (.mcpb)
- Understanding Desktop vs CLI differences
- Troubleshooting Desktop-specific issues
- Configuring worktree location

## Quick Decision Tree

**What do you want to do?**

1. **Install Claude Desktop** -> Query docs-management: "Claude Desktop download", "Desktop system requirements"
2. **Set up parallel sessions** -> Query docs-management: "parallel local sessions", "Git worktrees Desktop"
3. **Configure .worktreeinclude** -> Query docs-management: ".worktreeinclude file", ".worktreeinclude patterns"
4. **Start cloud sessions** -> Query docs-management: "cloud session launch", "remote environment Desktop"
5. **Configure environment variables** -> Query docs-management: "Desktop environment variables", "custom env vars"
6. **Install Desktop Extensions** -> Query docs-management: "Desktop extensions", ".mcpb files"
7. **Choose Desktop vs CLI** -> Query docs-management: "Desktop vs CLI", "Desktop use cases"
8. **Configure MCP in Desktop** -> Query docs-management: "claude_desktop_config.json", "Desktop MCP config"
9. **Troubleshoot issues** -> Query docs-management: "Desktop troubleshooting" + specific issue

## Topic Coverage

### Installation

- Download from claude.ai/download
- macOS Universal build (Intel + Apple Silicon)
- Windows x64 and ARM64 versions
- Windows ARM64 limitation (cloud-only)
- First launch bundled version download
- Automatic version management

### Git Worktrees for Parallel Sessions

- Run multiple Claude Code sessions simultaneously
- Isolated worktree per session
- Default location: ~/.claude-worktrees
- Configurable worktree location
- Git initialization requirement

### .worktreeinclude Configuration

- Copy .gitignored files to worktrees
- .gitignore-style pattern syntax
- Must match BOTH .worktreeinclude AND .gitignore
- Common patterns (.env, .env.local, .env.*, settings.local.json)

### Cloud Sessions

- Launch on Anthropic secure infrastructure
- Select remote environment on session creation
- /teleport command for cloud sessions
- /remote-env command for environment configuration
- claude.ai subscriber features

### Environment Configuration

- Automatic PATH extraction from shell
- Access to yarn, npm, node, development tools
- Custom environment variable configuration
- .env format for key-value pairs
- Multiline value support with quotes

### Desktop Extensions (.mcpb)

- One-click MCP server installation
- File format: .mcpb (MCP Bundle)
- No terminal or manual configuration
- Bundled Node.js runtime
- Drag-and-drop installation

### Desktop vs CLI Differences

- Desktop: Graphical interface, higher control, stability-focused
- CLI: Command-line, agentic behavior, newer features first
- Desktop: Beginners, non-coders, deliberate workflows
- CLI: Professional developers, automation, IDE integration
- Worktrees: Built-in GUI (Desktop) vs manual CLI

## Delegation Patterns

### Standard Query Pattern

```text
User asks: "How do I set up Claude Desktop?"

1. Invoke docs-management skill
2. Use keywords: "Claude Desktop download", "Desktop system requirements"
3. Load official documentation
4. Provide guidance based EXCLUSIVELY on official docs
```

### Multi-Topic Query Pattern

```text
User asks: "I want parallel sessions with my .env files copied"

1. Invoke docs-management skill with multiple queries:
   - "parallel local sessions", "Git worktrees Desktop"
   - ".worktreeinclude file", ".worktreeinclude patterns"
2. Synthesize guidance from official documentation
```

### Troubleshooting Pattern

```text
User reports: "Worktree isn't being created"

1. Invoke docs-management skill
2. Use keywords: "Git worktrees Desktop", "worktree requirements"
3. Check official docs for Git initialization requirement
4. Guide user through setup from official docs
```

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Issue | Keywords for docs-management |
| --- | --- |
| Worktree not created | "Git worktrees Desktop", "Git initialization" |
| Cloud sessions unavailable | "cloud session launch", "remote environment" |
| Extension won't install | "Desktop extensions", ".mcpb files" |
| Environment variables not working | "Desktop environment variables", "PATH extraction" |
| Windows ARM64 local sessions | "Windows ARM64", "Desktop limitations" |
| MCP config location | "claude_desktop_config.json" + platform |
