> ⚠️ **STALENESS WARNING:** Do NOT hardcode field names, valid values, or requirements here.
> ALWAYS query docs-management for the authoritative list of YAML frontmatter fields.

### Query Pattern for Official Fields

```text
docs-management: "sub-agents.md configuration fields"
docs-management: "agent YAML frontmatter required optional"
```

### Expected Field Categories

| Category | Query Pattern | What You'll Find |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Required fields | "agent required fields" | Fields that must be present |
| Optional fields | "agent optional fields" | Fields with default behavior |
| Model selection | "agent model selection" | Valid model values |
| Permission modes | "agent permissionMode values" | Valid permission mode values |
| Skills auto-load | "agent skills field" | Skills configuration syntax |

**Important:** The `color` property documented below is NOT in official Claude Code documentation.

## Color Property (Undocumented)

The `color` property is an undocumented feature that sets the UI color for subagents. It is NOT in official Claude Code documentation and may change without notice.

**Available Values:** red, blue, green, yellow, purple, orange, pink, cyan

**Placement:** Typically placed after `model` or at the bottom of YAML frontmatter.

**Example:**

```yaml
---
name: my-agent
description: Description of what this agent does
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
model: haiku
color: blue
---
```

**Warning:** As an undocumented feature, this property:

- May not work in all Claude Code versions
- May be removed or changed without notice
- Should not be relied upon for critical functionality

## Repository Color Standard

This repository uses a semantic color categorization for subagents to provide visual consistency:

### Category Assignments

| Category | Color | Purpose | Agents |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Documentation/Meta** | purple | Documentation, auditing, meta-skills | docs-researcher, docs-validator, skill-auditor |
| **Code Quality** | blue | Code analysis, review, debugging, testing | code-reviewer, codebase-analyst, debugger, test-generator |
| **Research** | green | Research, information gathering, web content | mcp-research, platform-docs-researcher, web-research |

### Reserved Colors (Future Use)

| Color | Reserved For |
| --- | --- |
| orange | Generation/Creation agents |
| red | Critical/Error handling agents |
| yellow | Warning/Attention agents |
| pink | User-facing/Communication agents |
| cyan | Utility agents |

### When to Assign Colors

When creating new agents for this repository:

1. **Identify the agent's primary purpose** (documentation, code quality, research, etc.)
2. **Match to existing category** if possible
3. **Use reserved colors** only for new categories that match the reserved purpose

## Known Issues

### CRLF Line Endings Cause Silent Loading Failures (v2.1.x)

**GitHub Issues:** [#16916](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16916), [#11205](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/11205)

**Symptoms:** Agent files exist but aren't available when spawning via Task tool. No error messages - agents silently fail to load.

**Cause:** Claude Code v2.1.x introduced stricter YAML parsing. Agent files with Windows-style CRLF line endings (`\r\n`) fail to parse correctly, causing the agent to be skipped during plugin loading.

**Detection:**

```bash
# Check if file has CRLF
file path/to/agent.md
# CRLF present: "ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators"
# LF only: "ASCII text" (no CRLF mention)
```

**Fix:**

```bash
# Convert CRLF to LF
sed -i 's/\r$//' path/to/agent.md

# Or using dos2unix
dos2unix path/to/agent.md
```

**Prevention:**

- Configure Git to use LF for `.md` files: `*.md text eol=lf` in `.gitattributes`
- Configure your editor to use LF for markdown files
- Run `file *.md` to check for CRLF before committing new agents

**After Fix:** Restart Claude Code session to pick up the corrected agent files.

### Plugin Agents Not Registered in plugin.json

**Symptoms:** Agent file exists in plugin's `agents/` directory but isn't available when spawning via Task tool. No error messages.

**Cause:** The plugin's `plugin.json` uses an **explicit agents array** instead of directory auto-discovery. New agent files must be manually added to the array.

**Detection:**

```bash
# Check if plugin.json uses explicit array vs directory
grep -A 5 '"agents"' .claude-plugin/plugin.json
# Array: "agents": ["./agents/foo.md", ...]  <- Manual registration required
# Directory: "agents": "./agents"  <- Auto-discovery
```

**Fix:** Add the new agent file to the `agents` array in `plugin.json`.

**Cross-reference:** See `plugin-development` skill → "Component Registration in plugin.json" for detailed guidance on explicit vs auto-discovery modes.

## Repository-Specific Notes

This repository uses subagents for:

- **Explore agents**: Codebase exploration and research
- **Plan agents**: Implementation planning
- **General-purpose agents**: Complex multi-step tasks

When creating agents for this repository, follow patterns in `.claude/settings.json` and existing agent configurations.

## Related Guidance

For comprehensive subagent usage guidance beyond configuration:

- **When to use subagents**: See `.claude/memory/operational-rules.md` → "Agent Usage Principles"
- **Parallelization strategies**: See `.claude/memory/performance-quick-start.md` → "Strategy 1: Parallelization"
- **Context preservation patterns**: See `.claude/memory/operational-rules.md` → "Agent Communication Pattern"
- **Proactive delegation rule**: See `CLAUDE.md` Quick Reference → "PROACTIVE DELEGATION"

## Auditing Agents

This skill provides the validation criteria used by the `agent-auditor` agent for formal audits.

### Audit Resources

| Resource | Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Validation Checklist | `references/validation-checklist.md` | Pre-creation verification checklist |
| Scoring Rubric | `references/validation-checklist.md#audit-scoring-rubric` | Formal audit scoring criteria |
| Undocumented Features | `references/undocumented-features.md` | Color, permissionMode, skills field details |

### Scoring Categories

| Category | Points | Key Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name Field | 20 | Lowercase, hyphens, max 64 chars, no reserved words |
| Description Field | 25 | Third person, delegation triggers, when-to-use guidance |
| Tools Configuration | 20 | Appropriate restrictions, not over/under restricted |
| Model Selection | 15 | Appropriate for task complexity |
| Additional Fields | 20 | Color, skills, permissionMode correctly configured |

**Thresholds:** 85+ = PASS, 70-84 = PASS WITH WARNINGS, <70 = FAIL

### Related Agent

The `agent-auditor` agent (Haiku model) performs formal audits using this skill:

- Auto-loads this skill via `skills: subagent-development`
- Uses validation checklist and scoring rubric
- Checks both official and undocumented features
- Generates structured audit reports
- Invoked by `/audit-agents` command

### External Technology Validation

When auditing agents that use external technologies (scripts, packages, runtimes), the auditor MUST validate claims using MCP servers before flagging findings.

**Technologies Requiring MCP Validation:**

- .NET/C# scripts: Validate with microsoft-learn + perplexity
- Node.js/npm packages: Validate with context7 + perplexity
- Python scripts/packages: Validate with context7 + perplexity
- Shell scripts: Validate with perplexity
- Any version-specific claims: ALWAYS validate with perplexity

**Validation Rule:**

Never flag a technology usage as incorrect without first:

1. Querying appropriate MCP server(s) for current documentation
2. Verifying with perplexity for recent changes (especially .NET 10+)
3. Documenting MCP sources in the finding

**Stale Data Warning:**

- microsoft-learn can return cached/outdated documentation
- ALWAYS pair microsoft-learn with perplexity for version verification
- Trust perplexity for version numbers and recently-released features
