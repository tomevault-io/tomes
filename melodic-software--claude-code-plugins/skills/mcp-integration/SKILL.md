## Delegation Patterns

### Standard Query Pattern

```text
User asks: "How do I add an MCP server?"

1. Invoke docs-management skill
2. Use keywords: "installing MCP servers", "claude mcp add"
3. Load official documentation
4. Provide guidance based EXCLUSIVELY on official docs
```

### Multi-Topic Query Pattern

```text
User asks: "I want to share MCP servers with my team and authenticate with OAuth"

1. Invoke docs-management skill with multiple queries:
   - "project scope MCP", ".mcp.json file"
   - "MCP OAuth", "/mcp authentication"
2. Synthesize guidance from official documentation
```

### Troubleshooting Pattern

```text
User reports: "My MCP server won't connect on Windows"

1. Invoke docs-management skill
2. Use keywords: "Windows MCP servers", "cmd /c npx"
3. Check official docs for Windows-specific requirements
4. Guide user through Windows setup from official docs
```

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Issue | Keywords for docs-management |
| --- | --- |
| Server won't connect | "installing MCP servers", specific transport type |
| Windows connection errors | "Windows MCP servers", "cmd /c" |
| Authentication failing | "MCP OAuth", "/mcp authentication" |
| Scope not working | "MCP installation scopes", "scope precedence" |
| Environment variables not expanding | "environment variable expansion", ".mcp.json variables" |
| Output too large | "MCP output limits", "MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS" |
| Plugin MCP not loading | "plugin-provided MCP servers", "plugin MCP lifecycle" |
| Enterprise restrictions | "allowedMcpServers", "deniedMcpServers" |

## Repository-Specific Notes

This repository uses MCP servers for:

- **context7 MCP**: Library documentation lookup
- **firecrawl MCP**: Web scraping and search
- **microsoft-learn MCP**: Microsoft/Azure documentation
- **perplexity MCP**: AI-powered search
- **Ref MCP**: Documentation reference lookup

MCP servers are configured in the project's settings and should follow the patterns documented in official Claude Code documentation.

## Auditing MCP Configurations

This skill provides the validation criteria used by the `mcp-auditor` agent for formal audits.

### CRITICAL: CLI-First Discovery (MANDATORY)

**ALWAYS run `claude mcp list` FIRST** before searching for configuration files. This is mandatory because:

1. **File locations can change** between Claude Code versions
2. **User config is in `~/.claude.json`** (NOT `~/.claude/.mcp.json` - this path does not exist)
3. **The `mcpServers` key may be deep** in the file (line 200+) - easy to miss with partial reads
4. **CLI shows runtime state** - files may not reflect what is actually running

```bash
# Step 1: Get authoritative list of configured servers
claude mcp list

# Step 2: Get details on specific server (shows scope and config)
claude mcp get <server-name>
```

**Common Discovery Mistakes:**

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Correct Approach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Only searching for `.mcp.json` files | User MCP is in `~/.claude.json`, not a separate file | Use CLI first, then verify files |
| Reading only first N lines of `~/.claude.json` | `mcpServers` may be deep in the file (line 200+) | Grep for `mcpServers` key first |
| Ignoring CLI discovery | Files may not reflect runtime state | Always start with `claude mcp list` |
| Wrong path `~/.claude/.mcp.json` | This path does not exist; user config is `~/.claude.json` | Check official docs for current paths |

### Audit Resources

| Resource | Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Audit Framework | `references/audit-framework.md` | Query guides and scoring criteria |

### Scoring Categories

| Category | Points | Key Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Configuration Structure | 25 | Valid JSON, required fields |
| Server Entries | 25 | Valid server configs, proper format |
| Transport Config | 20 | Valid transport types, correct settings |
| Authentication | 15 | Proper auth, no exposed secrets |
| Scope Compliance | 15 | Correct scope (project/user/plugin) |

**Thresholds:** 85+ = PASS, 70-84 = PASS WITH WARNINGS, <70 = FAIL

### Related Agent

The `mcp-auditor` agent (Haiku model) performs formal audits using this skill:

- Auto-loads this skill via `skills: mcp-integration`
- Uses audit framework and docs-management for rules
- Generates structured audit reports
- Invoked by `/audit-mcp` command

### External Technology Validation

When auditing MCP configurations that reference external technologies (scripts, packages, runtimes), the auditor MUST validate claims using MCP servers before flagging findings.

**Technologies Requiring MCP Validation:**

- .NET/C# scripts: Validate with microsoft-learn + perplexity
- Node.js/npm packages: Validate with context7 + perplexity
- Python scripts/packages: Validate with context7 + perplexity
- Shell scripts: Validate with perplexity
- Any version-specific claims: ALWAYS validate with perplexity

**Validation Rule:**

Never flag a technology usage as incorrect without first:

1. Querying appropriate MCP server(s) for current documentation
2. Verifying with perplexity for recent changes (especially .NET 10+)
3. Documenting MCP sources in the finding

**Stale Data Warning:**

- microsoft-learn can return cached/outdated documentation
- ALWAYS pair microsoft-learn with perplexity for version verification
- Trust perplexity for version numbers and recently-released features
