Then ask: "What do colleagues consistently ask you for help with?"

### Step 2: Find the Overlap

Analyze responses to identify niche:

```text
        ┌─────────────────┐
        │     SKILLS      │
        │  [User's tech   │
        │   strengths]    │
        └────────┬────────┘
                 │
      ┌──────────┼──────────┐
      ▼          ▼          ▼
  ┌───────┐  ┌───────┐  ┌───────┐
  │       │  │ YOUR  │  │       │
  │       │◄─┤ NICHE ├─►│       │
  │       │  │       │  │       │
  └───┬───┘  └───────┘  └───┬───┘
      │                     │
      ▼                     ▼
┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐
│  INTERESTS  │   │   MARKET    │
│ [What they  │   │   NEEDS     │
│   enjoy]    │   │ [Demand]    │
└─────────────┘   └─────────────┘
```

Identify 2-3 potential niches where circles overlap.

### Step 3: Craft the Brand Statement

Use the formula:

> "I help **[target audience]** achieve **[specific outcome]** by **[your unique approach]**"

**Components:**

| Component | What to Include |
| --- | --- |
| **Target audience** | Be specific: role + context |
| **Specific outcome** | Concrete result they want |
| **Unique approach** | Your methodology, perspective, or experience |

### Step 4: Generate Statement Options

Produce 3-5 variations:

```markdown
## Personal Brand Statement Options

### Option 1: The Educator
> "I help [audience] understand [complex topic] by breaking it down into practical, actionable steps."

### Option 2: The Problem Solver
> "I help [audience] overcome [specific challenge] through [your methodology]."

### Option 3: The Translator
> "I help [technical audience] and [non-technical audience] work better together by [bridging method]."

### Option 4: The Builder
> "I help [audience] ship [outcome] faster by creating [tools/processes/systems]."

### Option 5: The Guide
> "I help [audience] navigate [transition/challenge] based on lessons from [your experience]."
```

### Step 5: Context-Specific Variations

Generate versions for different contexts:

```markdown
## Brand Statement Variants

### LinkedIn Headline (120 characters max)
[Role] | [Specialization] | [Value hook]

### Twitter/X Bio (160 characters max)
[Concise version with personality]

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
"I'm a [role] who specializes in [niche]. I help [audience] by [approach]. Recently, I [credibility example]."

### Full Bio (100 words)
[Expanded version for conference submissions, about pages]

### One-Liner (10 words)
[The most distilled version]
```

### Step 6: Validation Questions

Before finalizing, check:

```markdown
## Validation Checklist

Test your statement against these criteria:

- [ ] **Natural:** Can you say it in conversation without feeling awkward?
- [ ] **Memorable:** Would someone remember this after meeting you?
- [ ] **Differentiated:** Does this distinguish you from others in your field?
- [ ] **Authentic:** Does this reflect who you actually are?
- [ ] **Actionable:** Does it suggest what you can do for someone?
- [ ] **Believable:** Can you back this up with evidence?
```

## Example Output
