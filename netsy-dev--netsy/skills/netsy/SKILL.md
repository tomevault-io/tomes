name: check-dev
description: Checks the status and diagnoses the health of the Netsy dev environment (make dev). Checks overmind processes, dev-s3, health endpoints, log files for errors, heartbeat and election state, and primary election status. Use when asked to check, verify, or debug the dev environment. Use when this capability is needed.

# Checking Dev Health

Runs diagnostics on a running Netsy dev environment (`make dev`).

## What It Checks

1. **Processes** — overmind socket, dev-s3, and netsy instance(s) must be running
2. **Health endpoints** — HTTP health check on `:8080/health`, TCP checks on client/peer gRPC ports, dev-s3 port
3. **Log files** — scans `temp/logs/` for panics, fatals, and error-level logs
4. **Election status** — confirms elector leadership was acquired and a primary was elected
5. **Heartbeat health** — checks for degradation, self-degradation, and heartbeat failures

## Usage

Run the diagnostic script:

```bash
./scripts/check-dev.sh
```

The script exits 0 if healthy (including warnings only), exits 1 if any failures are found.

### Investigating Failures

If the script reports failures or warnings, follow up:

1. **Check dev logs** in `temp/logs/` for context:
   - `temp/logs/dev-s3.log` — fake S3 storage issues
   - `temp/logs/netsy-1.log` (and `netsy-2.log`, etc.) — node startup, election, heartbeat, replication
   - Filter with `grep -i -E "error|warn|panic" temp/logs/netsy-1.log | tail -20`

2. **Correlate with design docs** under `docs/design/` for expected behavior:
   - `docs/design/leader-election.md` — two-tier election, heartbeat mechanism, degradation rules
   - `docs/design/loading-startup.md` — bootstrap sequence, registration, backfill
   - `docs/design/storage-replication.md` — quorum config, primary/replica roles
   - `docs/design/failure-scenarios.md` — expected failure modes and recovery

3. **Common failure patterns**:
   - `"no registered nodes"` — election ran before node registration completed (normal on first attempt)
   - `"no healthy candidates"` — node marked degraded due to missed heartbeats; check heartbeat sender logs
   - `"non-degraded node X has primary state "` — node map entry missing `PrimaryState` initialization
   - `"election_failed"` looping indefinitely — check that heartbeats are reaching the elector

## Prerequisites

The user should already have `make dev` running. Use `make clean-dev` then `make dev` to restart from a clean state.
