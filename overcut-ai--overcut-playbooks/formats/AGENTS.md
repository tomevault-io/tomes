# AGENTS.md

This file provides instructions for AI agents working with the Overcut Playbooks repository. It contains essential information for creating, updating, and maintaining playbooks (workflow templates).

## 📋 Project Overview

This repository contains **Overcut Playbooks** - pre-built, customizable AI agent workflows for software development automation. Each playbook is a complete workflow that can be imported into [Overcut](https://overcut.ai) and customized for specific needs.

**Key Technologies:**

- Overcut Workflow JSON format (version 1.0.0)
- Markdown for prompts and documentation
- Git for version control

**Detailed Reference Skills:** The `.agents/skills/` directory contains deep-dive reference skills for triggers, step actions, agent sessions, template variables, prompt engineering, and agent tools. These are symlinked into each agent's config folder (`.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.codex/`, `.gemini/`, `.agent/`) and activate automatically when relevant.

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

Each playbook must follow this structure:

```
playbook-name/
├── workflow.json          # Complete workflow definition (REQUIRED)
├── README.md              # Documentation following standard template (REQUIRED)
├── step-id-name.md        # Prompt file for each step (REQUIRED - one per step)
├── another-step-id.md     # Additional step prompts as needed
├── special-agents/        # (OPTIONAL) Specialized agent instructions
│   └── agent-name.md      # Instructions for configuring custom agents
└── ...                    # More steps as needed
```

## 🎯 Creating New Playbooks

Follow this **design-first approach** to ensure the workflow is well-planned before implementation:

### Step 1: Create Playbook Folder

- **Naming**: Use `lowercase-with-hyphens` (e.g., `auto-code-review`, `migration-assistant`)
- **Location**: Root of repository
- **Command**: `mkdir playbook-name && cd playbook-name`

### Step 2: Create README.md with High-Level Flow

**Start with the design and documentation first.** This helps clarify the workflow structure before implementation.

Use this template structure:

```markdown
# [Workflow Name]

## 📋 Overview

[2-3 sentences about what it does and outputs]

## ⚡ Triggers

[Automatic and manual triggers]

## 🎯 Use Cases

[When to use this workflow]

## 🔧 Prerequisites

[Required setup, agents needed]

## 🏗️ Workflow Steps

[Step-by-step breakdown with agent assignments and durations]

- List each step with its purpose, agent type, and estimated duration
- Describe the flow between steps
- Identify what data passes between steps

## 🎨 Customization

[How to adapt the workflow, which prompts to edit]

## 🔗 Related Workflows

[Links to related playbooks]
```

**README Requirements:**

- Complete all sections, especially the "Workflow Steps" section
- Define the high-level flow and step sequence
- Document what each step does and which agents are needed
- Include customization guide
- Document prerequisites clearly
- Add related workflow links
- Grammar and spelling checked

**Purpose**: The README serves as the design document. It should clearly describe:

- What the workflow does
- How it flows from step to step
- What each step accomplishes
- What data/context flows between steps

### Step 3: Create Step Prompt Files

**After the README is approved, create the prompt files.** This ensures the prompts align with the design and makes sense before creating the JSON structure.

**CRITICAL NAMING RULE**: Prompt filenames **MUST** match the step IDs you'll use in workflow.json (use kebab-case).

**Process:**

1. **Identify steps from README**: Based on the "Workflow Steps" section, list all steps
2. **Name each step**: Use descriptive kebab-case names (e.g., `prepare-review-plan`, `code-review`, `submit-review`)
3. **Create prompt files**: For each step, create `{step-id}.md` with detailed instructions

**Example:**

- Planned step: "Prepare Review Plan"
- Step ID: `prepare-review-plan`
- Prompt filename: `prepare-review-plan.md` ✅
- **NOT**: `step-1-prepare-review-plan.md` ❌
- **NOT**: `prepareReviewPlan.md` ❌

**For each step:**

1. Create a `.md` file with the step ID as the filename
2. Write clear, detailed instructions for that step
3. Include:
   - What the step should accomplish
   - What inputs it receives (from previous steps or triggers)
   - What outputs it should produce
   - How to handle errors
   - Format requirements for outputs

**Prompt File Guidelines:**

- Use clear, specific instructions
- Include examples when helpful
- Handle error cases explicitly
- Specify output format requirements
- Pass complete context between steps using `{{outputs.step-id.message}}` for agent steps or `{{outputs.step-id}}` for infrastructure steps
- Reference the step's role in the overall workflow
- Ensure prompts align with the README design

**Purpose**: Creating prompts first helps validate:

- The workflow design makes sense
- Steps have clear responsibilities
- Data flow between steps is well-defined
- The prompts are complete and actionable

### Step 4: Create workflow.json

**Finally, create the workflow.json based on the approved README design and prompt files.** The JSON structure should implement exactly what was designed.

The `workflow.json` file must follow this structure:

```json
{
  "_formatVersion": "1.0.0",
  "workflow": {
    "name": "Workflow Display Name",
    "description": "Brief description of what the workflow does",
    "instructions": [...],
    "definition": {
      "flow": [...],
      "name": "Workflow Name",
      "steps": [...],
      "triggers": [...],
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "priority": 3,
      "timeoutMs": 3600000
    }
  },
  "refs": {
    "agents": [...]
  }
}
```

**Key Requirements:**

- **Step IDs must match prompt filenames exactly** (e.g., if you have `prepare-review-plan.md`, the step ID must be `"prepare-review-plan"`)
- Valid JSON syntax (validate before committing)
- Each step must have a unique `id` field
- Step IDs must be `kebab-case` (e.g., `prepare-review-plan`, `code-review`)
- Include appropriate `stepMaxDurationMinutes` for each step
- Define triggers (automatic events or manual slash commands)
- Include agent references in `refs.agents` array
- Flow connections must match the sequence described in README
- Set `instruction` to `null` for infrastructure steps (git.clone, repo.identify) — prompt content will be synced separately

**Implementation Process:**

1. **Create steps array**: For each prompt file, create a step object with:

   - `id`: Must match the prompt filename (without `.md`)
   - `name`: Human-readable step name
   - `action`: `agent.run`, `agent.session`, `git.clone`, etc.
   - `params`: Step-specific parameters
   - `instruction`: Set to `null` initially (will be synced from `.md` files)
   - `stepMaxDurationMinutes`: Based on README estimates

2. **Create flow array**: Define connections between steps based on README workflow sequence

3. **Create triggers**: Based on README trigger section

4. **Add agent references**: List all agents used in `refs.agents`

5. **Sync prompt content into workflow.json** using the sync script:

```bash
python3 scripts/sync-prompts.py <playbook-directory>
```

This automatically copies content from each `{step-id}.md` file into the matching step's `instruction` field in `workflow.json`, handling JSON escaping correctly.

**Validation:**

- Run `python3 scripts/sync-prompts.py <playbook-directory>` — it reports any mismatches
- Verify flow matches README sequence
- Verify triggers match README description

### Step 5: Special Agents (If Needed)

**When to use `special-agents/` folder:**

- ✅ Specialized roles requiring domain-specific knowledge (e.g., Security Engineer, Database Architect)
- ✅ Agents needing detailed behavioral guidelines or decision frameworks
- ✅ Custom agent personas unique to this workflow

**When NOT to use:**

- ❌ Generic roles (Backend Developer, Frontend Developer, Code Reviewer)
- ❌ Agents that work with default Overcut configurations
- ❌ Simple delegation without specialized expertise

**Special Agent File Structure:**

```markdown
# [Agent Name] Agent Instructions

## Role Identity

[Who the agent is and their expertise]

## Core Responsibilities

[What the agent does]

## Expertise

[Technical knowledge areas]

## Key Principles

[Behavioral guidelines]

## Analysis Framework

[Decision-making process]
```

## 🔄 Updating Existing Playbooks

### Updating Prompts

1. **Edit the prompt file** (e.g., `code-review.md`)
2. **Run the sync script** to update workflow.json automatically:

```bash
python3 scripts/sync-prompts.py <playbook-directory>
```

**Example:**

```bash
# Edit the prompt file
vim code-review/code-review.md

# Sync all prompts into workflow.json
python3 scripts/sync-prompts.py code-review
```

The script reads all `*.md` files in the playbook directory (excluding `README.md`), matches each to a step in `workflow.json` by filename == step ID, and updates the `instruction` field with the file content. It handles JSON escaping automatically and reports any mismatches between `.md` files and steps.

**Important:** Always use this script instead of manually copying prompt content into workflow.json. Manual copying is error-prone due to JSON string escaping (newlines, quotes, etc.).

### Adding New Steps

1. Add step to `workflow.json` with unique `id`
2. Create corresponding `{step-id}.md` file
3. Add flow connection in `workflow.definition.flow`
4. Update README.md workflow steps section

### Modifying Workflow Structure

- Update `workflow.definition.flow` for step connections
- Maintain valid JSON structure
- Update README.md to reflect changes
- Test workflow import in Overcut

## 🔧 Common Workflow Patterns

### Step Actions Quick Reference

| Action | Purpose | Has Instruction? | Key Params |
|--------|---------|-----------------|------------|
| `agent.run` | Single agent executes a prompt | Yes | `agentId`, `agentEngine` |
| `agent.session` | Coordinator orchestrates agents | Yes | `agentIds`, `goal`, `exitCriteria` |
| `git.clone` | Clone repositories | No | `repoFullName`, `branch`, `cloneOptions` |
| `repo.identify` | Identify relevant repos for a ticket | No | `maxResults`, `minConfidence` |
| `ci.executeWorkflow` | Trigger external CI pipeline | No | `repoFullName`, `workflowId`, `ref`, `inputs` |

> For complete parameter schemas, see the `step-actions` skill.

### Git Operations

```json
{
  "id": "git-clone",
  "name": "Clone Repo",
  "action": "git.clone",
  "params": {
    "branch": "{{trigger.pullRequest.headBranch}}",
    "repoFullName": "{{trigger.repository.fullName}}"
  }
}
```

### Agent Run (Single Agent)

Use `agent.run` for straightforward, single-pass tasks where one agent can complete the work without coordination or iteration.

```json
{
  "id": "step-id",
  "name": "Step Name",
  "action": "agent.run",
  "params": {
    "agentId": "agent-id-here"
  },
  "instruction": "[Content from step-id.md]"
}
```

### Agent Session (Coordinated Execution)

Use `agent.session` when a step needs a **coordinator** to oversee execution. This applies not only to multi-agent coordination, but also to:

- **Multi-step processes** that require sequencing, verification between steps, or iterative refinement
- **Error recovery** where a coordinator can detect failures, retry, or adjust course
- **Iterative loops** (e.g., draft → review → revise → approve cycles) that need supervision to track progress and enforce limits
- **Verification-heavy tasks** where each sub-task's output must be confirmed before proceeding to the next

The coordinator pattern ensures reliability by giving an orchestrating agent oversight of the process, rather than relying on a single agent to self-manage complex sequences.

```json
{
  "id": "step-id",
  "name": "Step Name",
  "action": "agent.session",
  "params": {
    "goal": "Goal description",
    "agentIds": ["agent-id-1", "agent-id-2"],
    "agentEngine": "overcut",
    "exitCriteria": {
      "timeLimit": {
        "maxDurationMinutes": 30
      }
    }
  },
  "instruction": "[Content from step-id.md]"
}
```

> For coordinator tools, delegation templates, and interactive session patterns, see the `agent-session-design` skill.

### Repository Identification (Issue-Triggered Workflows)

Use `repo.identify` → `git.clone` when a workflow starts from an issue/ticket and needs to determine which repos to work with:

```json
{
  "id": "identify-repos",
  "name": "Identify Repositories",
  "action": "repo.identify",
  "params": {
    "maxResults": 3,
    "minConfidence": 0.2
  },
  "instruction": null
}
```

Chain it with `git.clone` using template syntax:

```json
{
  "id": "clone-repo",
  "action": "git.clone",
  "params": {
    "repoFullName": "{{outputs.identify-repos}}",
    "cloneOptions": { "depth": 1 }
  }
}
```

### Flow Connections

```json
{
  "flow": [
    {
      "to": "step-2",
      "from": "step-1",
      "condition": null
    }
  ]
}
```

### Triggers

**Automatic (Event-based):**

```json
{
  "event": "pull_request_opened",
  "conditions": {
    "combinator": "and",
    "rules": [
      { "field": "context.pullRequest.draft", "operator": "equals", "value": "false" }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Manual (Slash Command):**

```json
{
  "event": "manual",
  "slashCommand": {
    "command": "review",
    "requireMention": false
  }
}
```

**CI Workflow (Event-based):**

```json
{
  "event": "ci_workflow_failed",
  "conditions": {
    "combinator": "and",
    "rules": [
      { "field": "context.ciWorkflow.branch", "operator": "equals", "value": "main" }
    ]
  }
}
```

> For all 28 event types, condition operators, schedule triggers, and real-world examples, see the `workflow-triggers` skill.

### Workflow Configuration

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `priority` | 5 | Execution priority (1-100, lower = higher priority) |
| `timeoutMs` | — | Abort workflow after this time (min: 30000ms) |
| `statusUpdateMethod` | `"comment"` | `"comment"`, `"reuse_comment"`, or `"static_comment"` |

## 🚨 Critical Rules

1. **Filename-ID Matching**: Prompt filenames MUST match step IDs exactly (case-sensitive, kebab-case)
2. **No Sensitive Data**: Never include API keys, tokens, credentials, or organization-specific agent IDs
3. **Valid JSON**: Always validate JSON syntax before committing
4. **Complete Documentation**: Every playbook must have a complete README.md
5. **Tested Workflows**: Only submit workflows that have been tested in Overcut

## 📝 Output Reference Syntax

When passing data between steps, use this syntax:

- `{{outputs.step-id}}` - Reference full output from infrastructure steps (git.clone, repo.identify)
- `{{outputs.step-id.message}}` - Reference text output from agent steps (agent.run, agent.session)
- `{{trigger.pullRequest.headBranch}}` - Reference PR branch
- `{{trigger.repository.fullName}}` - Reference repository name
- `{{trigger.issue.title}}` - Reference issue title
- `{{trigger.trigger.label}}` - Reference trigger-specific data (e.g., label that was added)

> For the complete list of trigger context fields and Handlebars helpers, see the `template-variables` skill.

## 🔍 Validation Checklist

Before submitting a playbook, verify:

- [ ] All prompt filenames match step IDs exactly
- [ ] workflow.json has valid JSON syntax

## 📚 Reference Examples

Study these playbooks for patterns, ordered by complexity:

**Simple** (good starting point):
- **Auto PR Description** (`auto-pr-description/`) — 3 steps, `agent.run` only, conditional skip pattern, idempotency markers

**Medium** (introduces coordination):
- **Remediate CVEs** (`remediate-cves/`) — 4 steps, `repo.identify` → `git.clone` chain, `agent.session`, label-based triggers, specialized agents
- **Code Review** (`code-review/`) — 5 steps, scratchpad tools + JSONL pattern, chunk processing, multi-agent delegation with tool constraints

**Complex** (full patterns):
- **Create PR from Design** (`create-pr-from-design/`) — 8 steps, blocking/gating, dependency resolution, phased implementation, progress tracking
