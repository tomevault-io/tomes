# Prompt Engineering for Overcut Workflows

This skill covers best practices for writing step prompt files (`.md`) that produce reliable, parseable results and work well within the Overcut workflow system.

## Core Principles

### 1. Structured Output for Downstream Parsing

Agent step outputs are passed to downstream steps via `{{outputs.step-id.message}}`. Use structured key:value formats so the next step can reliably parse the result:

```markdown
## Output Requirements

When the step completes, you MUST output:

status: ready
base_branch: main
total_findings: 12
```

**Not** free-form prose that's hard to parse.

### 2. Tool Constraint Tables

Always specify exactly which tools the agent may use. This prevents unnecessary API calls and keeps agents focused:

```markdown
### Allowed Tools
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `read_scratchpad` | ONLY for `review-findings` scratchpad |
| `write_scratchpad` | ONLY for `review-chunk-{N}` scratchpads |
| `task_completed` | Finish the task |

### Prohibited Tools
❌ `code_search` — no code searching needed
❌ `run_terminal_cmd` — no terminal commands
```

### 3. Context Preservation for Zero-Memory Agents

Sub-agents in `agent.session` have **no memory between delegations**. Every delegation must be self-contained:

- Include the complete schema/format requirements
- Include all file paths and references
- Include the full task description — don't say "continue from where you left off"
- Paste previous step output inline: `{{outputs.previous-step.message}}`

### 4. Max Iteration Limits

For iterative processes, always set explicit limits to prevent infinite loops:

```markdown
**Maximum 3 revision cycles.** If the review still finds issues after 3 revisions,
proceed with the current version and note remaining issues in the output.
```

### 5. File Path Conventions

- **Scratchpad tools for inter-agent data**: Prefer `write_scratchpad`/`read_scratchpad`/`append_scratchpad` over manual file operations for intermediate data shared between agents or steps
- **Workspace root files**: Use `.overcut/` prefix for any files that must be on disk (e.g., generated artifacts)
- **Paths are relative** to the workspace root — do NOT use absolute `/workspace/` paths
- **Cloned repos** appear under the workspace root at a path like `owner/repo/` — keep workspace files OUTSIDE cloned repo folders

## Output Format Conventions

### Simple Key:Value

For status and metadata that downstream steps need to parse:

```
status: ready
base_branch: main
chunks_created: yes
total_chunks: 3
chunk_names: review-chunk-1, review-chunk-2
```

### Structured Sections

For richer output with both parseable headers and detailed content:

```
status: ready
base_branch: feature/dependency-x

## Scope

### This Ticket
- #123: Implement user authentication

### Related Tickets (Out of Scope)
- #124: Add password reset — Status: in-progress
- #125: Add 2FA — Status: open
```

### JSONL for Large Data

When a step produces many structured items, use `append_scratchpad` to accumulate JSONL content in a named scratchpad rather than including it all in the output message:

```markdown
Append each finding as a JSON line to the `review-findings` scratchpad using `append_scratchpad`:

{"file": "src/auth.ts", "importance": "major", "title": "Missing validation", "message": "..."}
{"file": "src/api.ts", "importance": "minor", "title": "Unused import", "message": "..."}
```

`append_scratchpad` is safe for concurrent writes from parallel agents. Downstream steps read with `read_scratchpad`.

> **Legacy alternative**: File-based JSONL (e.g., `append_file` to `.overcut/review/scratchpad.jsonl`) is still supported but scratchpad tools are preferred for inter-agent data.

## Advanced Patterns

### Blocking/Gating Pattern

A step can block the entire workflow by outputting `status: blocked`:

```markdown
### If Blocked

status: blocked
blocker: #456 — dependency ticket has no PR yet

The downstream step checks: if status is "blocked", use `task_completed` and stop.
```

### Conditional Skipping

A step can signal that subsequent work should be skipped:

```markdown
If no changes are needed, output: `SKIP: [reason]`
If changes are needed, output: `PROCEED: [details]`
```

The next step checks the prefix to decide whether to execute.

### Progress Tracking via PR Comments

For long-running steps, use PR comment checkboxes to show progress:

```markdown
Post a PR comment with this checklist and update it as phases complete:

## Implementation Progress
- [x] Phase 1: Database schema changes
- [ ] Phase 2: API endpoint updates
- [ ] Phase 3: Frontend integration
```

### Idempotency Markers

When a step updates content that might already exist (e.g., PR descriptions), use HTML comment markers:

```markdown
Look for existing markers:
<!-- overcut:pr-description:start -->
...existing content...
<!-- overcut:pr-description:end -->

If markers exist, replace only the content between them.
If markers don't exist, append the new content.
```

### Cross-Workflow Triggering

A step can trigger another workflow by posting a slash command:

```markdown
After completing the remediation plan, post a comment with `/pr` to trigger
the Create PR from Design workflow to implement the fix.
```

### Delegation Templates

In coordinator prompts, use complete self-contained delegation blocks. See the `agent-session-design` skill for the template pattern.

## Prompt Structure Template

A well-structured step prompt follows this pattern:

```markdown
You are [role description].

## Mission
[What the agent should accomplish — 1-2 sentences]

## Context
[Input data, previous step output references, file locations]

## Process
### Step 0 — Acknowledge
Update status with `update_status` tool.

### Step 1 — [First action]
[Detailed instructions]

### Step 2 — [Second action]
[Detailed instructions]

## Output Requirements
[Structured key:value format for downstream parsing]

## Behavior Rules
• [Specific constraints]
• [What NOT to do]
• [Error handling instructions]
```
