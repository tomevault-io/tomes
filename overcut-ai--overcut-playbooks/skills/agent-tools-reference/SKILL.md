# Agent Tools Reference

This skill covers the tools available to Overcut agents, built-in agent type presets, and the persistent memory system.

## Tool Categories Overview

Overcut provides 40 user-configurable tools plus 10 system tools, organized by category:

| Category | Tools | Count |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **File System** | CreateDirectory, ListDirectory, ReadFile, WriteFile, DeleteFile, EditFile, AppendFile | 7 |
| **Code Utilities** | ListCodeDefinitionNames, CodeSearch, SemanticCodeSearch, RunTerminalCmd, GetDiagnostics | 5 |
| **Tickets/Issues** | CreateTicket, UpdateTicket, ListTickets, ReadTicket, AddCommentToTicket, UpdateCommentOnTicket | 6 |
| **Pull Requests** | CreatePullRequest, ReadPullRequest, UpdatePullRequest, ListPullRequests, MergePullRequest, AddCommentToPullRequest, UpdateCommentOnPullRequest, ClosePullRequest | 8 |
| **Code Review** | AddPullRequestReviewThread, SubmitReview, AddPullRequestReviewThreadReply, GetPullRequestDiff, GetPullRequestDiffLineNumbers | 5 |
| **CI/CD** | GetCiRunDetails, GetCiRunLogs, ListPrCiRuns, GetCiJobLogs, RetryCiWorkflow | 5 |
| **Attachments** | GetTicketAttachments, GetPullRequestAttachments | 2 |
| **Exploration** | ExploreCodebase | 1 |
| **Memory** (auto-injected) | MemoryWrite, MemoryRead | 2 |
| **Scratchpad** (auto-injected) | WriteScratchpad, ReadScratchpad, ListScratchpads, AppendScratchpad | 4 |
| **Coordinator-only** (auto-injected) | DelegateToSubAgent, UpdateStatus, TaskCompletedTool | 3 |

## Built-in Agent Types

When creating agents in Overcut, you select a base type that determines the default tool set:

| Agent Type | Tools | Focus |
|------------|-------|-------|
| **SeniorDeveloper** | 31 tools | Full-stack development: all file, code, ticket, PR, CI/CD, and exploration tools |
| **CodeReview** | 26 tools | Code review: read-only file access + append, code search, review tools, PR read/update, CI read tools |
| **TechWriter** | 25 tools | Documentation: full file access, code search, ticket and PR tools |
| **ProductManager** | 20 tools | Planning: read-only file access, code search, ticket CRUD, PR read/update |
| **ExploreAgent** | 5 tools | Exploration: ReadFile, ListDirectory, CodeSearch, SemanticCodeSearch, RunTerminalCmd |

**Key differences:**
- **SeniorDeveloper** can create PRs, merge PRs, delete files — full write access
- **CodeReview** cannot create PRs or delete files, but can submit reviews and append to files
- **TechWriter** has nearly the same tools as SeniorDeveloper (full write access for docs)
- **ProductManager** cannot create PRs, write files, or delete files — primarily read + ticket management
- **ExploreAgent** is minimal — read-only code exploration only

### Automatic Tool Injection

Regardless of base type, these tools are **automatically added** at runtime:
- **Memory tools** (`memory_write`, `memory_read`) — added to all agents (coordinator and sub-agents)
- **Scratchpad tools** (`write_scratchpad`, `read_scratchpad`, `list_scratchpads`, `append_scratchpad`) — added to all agents (coordinator and sub-agents)
- **Coordinator tools** (`delegate_to_sub_agent`, `update_status`, `task_completed`) — added only to coordinator agents in `agent.session` steps

## Memory System

The memory system allows agents to persist and retrieve learnings across workflow executions.

### memory_write

```json
{
  "title": "Short summary of the learning (1 line)",
  "content": "Full details of the learning"
}
```

- `title`: Short summary used as the identifier (1 line)
- `content`: Full details of the learning

### memory_read

```json
{
  "title": "Memory title to retrieve"
}
```

- `title`: Case-insensitive match against stored memory titles

### Memory Behavior

- Memories persist across workflow executions for the same agent
- Auto-injected into agent context at the start of each execution
- Use for: repository conventions, past review patterns, common issues, team preferences
- Keep titles descriptive and unique for reliable retrieval

## Scratchpad System

The scratchpad system provides ephemeral, per-run storage for sharing structured data between agents within a single workflow execution.

### write_scratchpad

```json
{
  "name": "Scratchpad name (e.g., 'review-findings', 'chunk-1')",
  "content": "Content to write (overwrites existing)"
}
```

- `name`: Identifier for the scratchpad (use kebab-case, descriptive names)
- `content`: Full content to write (replaces any existing content)

### read_scratchpad

```json
{
  "name": "Scratchpad name to read"
}
```

- `name`: Exact name of the scratchpad to read

### list_scratchpads

```json
{}
```

No parameters. Returns all scratchpad names in the current run.

### append_scratchpad

```json
{
  "name": "Scratchpad name to append to",
  "content": "Content to append"
}
```

- `name`: Scratchpad to append to (creates it if it doesn't exist)
- `content`: Content to append (added after existing content)

### Scratchpad Behavior

- Scratchpads are **ephemeral** — they exist only for the duration of the workflow run
- Auto-injected into all agents (coordinator and sub-agents)
- Use for: intermediate findings, chunk data, structured results shared between steps or agents
- `append_scratchpad` is safe for concurrent writes from parallel agents
- Use kebab-case names (e.g., `review-findings`, `chunk-1`, `security-analysis`)

### Scratchpad vs Memory

| | Scratchpad | Memory |
|---|---|---|
| **Lifetime** | Single workflow run | Persists across runs |
| **Purpose** | Share data between agents/steps | Store learnings for future runs |
| **Concurrency** | `append_scratchpad` is safe for parallel writes | Not designed for concurrent access |
| **Use when** | Passing intermediate data (findings, chunks) | Saving patterns, conventions, preferences |

## Tool Selection for Prompts

When writing step prompts, restrict tools to only what's needed. Use allowed/prohibited tool tables:

```markdown
### Allowed Tools
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `read_file` | Read source files for analysis |
| `code_search` | Find relevant code patterns |
| `append_scratchpad` | Store findings for downstream steps |
| `add_comment_to_pull_request` | Post review summary |

### Prohibited Tools
❌ `write_file` — this is a read-only analysis step
❌ `run_terminal_cmd` — no terminal commands needed
❌ `create_pull_request` — PR already exists
```

This pattern appears in many real playbooks and significantly improves agent focus and efficiency.
