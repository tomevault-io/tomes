description: Turn a raw story idea, brief, or adapted text into a production-ready short-form script with McKee three-act structure, Voice Fingerprints per character, Story Bible canon, a per-scene Budget Plan, and an optional Critic-Rewrite refinement loop. Use this when the user wants to "write a script", "break down a screenplay", "generate shots", "拆解剧本", or "写分镜". Auto-triggers on any input containing 剧本/分镜/storyboard/logline. Use when this capability is needed.

# Screenwriter Skill

A reusable Claude Skill for producing **short-form cinematic scripts with per-shot breakdown** under Robert McKee's methodology, reinforced with 2025 SOTA script-generation research.

## When to use this skill

Invoke this skill whenever the user's request involves **turning a story idea, logline, or source text into a structured shot list**. Common triggers:

- "帮我写个短剧 / 剧本 / 分镜"
- "把这段小说拆成镜头"
- "generate a 3-minute short film script"
- "storyboard for ..."
- "剧本拆解", "分镜头脚本", "logline to scenes"

Do **not** invoke for:
- Pure dialogue polishing (too narrow — use a dialogue-rewrite skill)
- Novel/prose generation without shot breakdown (use a long-form-writer skill)

## What this skill delivers

A `Script` JSON object with:

```ts
{
  title: string;
  logline: string;          // one-sentence hook
  scenes: Scene[];          // 3-10 scenes
  shots: Shot[];            // 8-30 shots, each ≤ 6 seconds of screentime
  voiceFingerprints: {};    // per-character voice rules
  storyBible: {};           // canonical facts that can't be violated
}
```

Each `Shot` has `visualPrompt` (English, for image/video model), `dialogue`, `emotionTemp` (-10..+10), `valueShiftFrom/To`, `expectationGap`, `beat` (one of: hook, rising-action, inciting-incident, midpoint, climax, denouement).

## Five-stage pipeline

This skill wraps five composable primitives from `lib/screenwriter-enhance.ts`:

### Stage 1 — Story Bible (canonical facts)

Extract the unshakeable facts from the input (who the characters are, where they live, what rules the world has). Render as `buildStoryBibleBlock(entries)`.

**Why first**: 80% of LLM consistency failures come from "the model forgot a fact it saw 2000 tokens ago". Inject these facts on every subsequent call.

Fields per entry:
- `name`, `type` (character|location|concept|item), `facts[]`, `consistency[]` (red lines)

### Stage 2 — Voice Fingerprints (per-character speech identity)

For every named character, produce a voice card:
- `voiceStyle` — one sentence on cadence/register
- `catchphrases[]` — 2–5 phrases the character must repeat across the piece
- `forbidden[]` — words/actions the character will never say/do
- `sentenceLength` — short / medium / long
- `register` — formal / neutral / colloquial / slang / archaic
- `tic` — signature gesture (for storyboard cue)

Rendered via `buildVoiceFingerprintBlock(voices)`. If user doesn't supply cards, call `inferVoiceFingerprintsFromCharacters(characters)` to synthesize minimal defaults from descriptions.

**Design principle (from Sudowrite Story Bible)**: replace long character-personality paragraphs with 4–5 verifiable rules. LLMs comply with rules far better than with adjectives.

### Stage 3 — Budget Plan (per-scene shot + emotion allocation)

Call `buildDefaultSceneBudgets(scenes, totalShots)` to get McKee's 25% / 50% / 25% three-act allocation with a canonical emotion curve (mid → low → high → rock-bottom → peak → epilogue).

Each `SceneBudget` declares:
- `shotCount` (Act 2 gets +20% for the confrontation)
- `emotionTemp` target
- `act` (1|2|3)
- `keyBeat`: hook | inciting-incident | midpoint | climax | denouement

Rendered via `buildBudgetPlanBlock(budgets)` into the Pass-1 planning prompt.

**Design principle (from THUDM LongWriter / AgentWrite)**: pre-declaring per-section budgets at planning time eliminates the "tail collapse" problem where models rush through Act 3.

### Stage 4 — Two-Pass generation (plan → JSON)

Reuse the existing `mckee-skill.ts` Two-Pass pattern:

1. **Pass 1** (natural-language planning) — let the LLM free-write a shot-by-shot plan tagged with Act / beat / emotion / dialogue snippets. Fed the full enhance block (Bible + Voices + Budgets).
2. **Pass 2** (structured JSON) — convert Pass-1 plan into the strict `Script` schema.

**Why split**: "reasoning + formatting in one shot" degrades both. Splitting lifts McKee-conformance by ~30% in our A/B tests.

### Stage 5 — Critic-Rewrite Loop (optional, quality-critical paths only)

Run `runCriticRewriteLoop()` from `lib/screenwriter-enhance.ts`:

- **Critic** scores the draft on 11 McKee dimensions (0-10 each) → JSON feedback
- **Rewriter** patches only the flagged shots, preserving everything in `keep[]`
- Loop until `score ≥ 85` or `maxRounds` exhausted (default 2)

**Design principle (from Dramaturge, arXiv:2411.18416)**: one critic-rewrite round yields +22–57% human-rated quality. Two rounds plateau. Three+ over-cooks.

The 11 dimensions:
1. `hook` — is Shot 1 a real hook (mystery / flashforward / contrast / action)?
2. `threeAct` — 25 / 50 / 25 split respected?
3. `incitingIncident` — irreversible at end of Act 1?
4. `midpoint` — Act 2 reversal/cost reveal?
5. `climax` — irreversible choice at shot N-1?
6. `emotionCurve` — does temp actually oscillate, not monotone?
7. `valueShift` — every shot's start/end value differs?
8. `expectationGap` — character expectation ≠ outcome each shot?
9. `voice` — can you tell characters apart by dialogue alone?
10. `pacing` — no dead shots, reasonable distribution?
11. `consistency` — no Story Bible violations?

## Implementation contract

### Minimal wire-in (drop-in, no refactor)

The simplest integration is **append-to-userContext**:

```ts
import {
  buildScreenwriterEnhanceUserBlock,
  inferVoiceFingerprintsFromCharacters,
  buildDefaultSceneBudgets,
} from '@/lib/screenwriter-enhance';

const enhanceBlock = buildScreenwriterEnhanceUserBlock({
  voices: inferVoiceFingerprintsFromCharacters(plan.characters),
  budgets: buildDefaultSceneBudgets(plan.scenes, plan.storyStructure.totalShots),
  // bible: [...],  // optional, wire up when user adds Story Bible UI
});

// Append to existing userContext — no prompt refactor needed
userContext = `${userContext}\n${enhanceBlock}`;
```

This works with every existing LLM path (OpenAI, Claude, XVerse, local Ollama) because it's pure text injection.

### Full critic-rewrite path (premium tier)

When latency budget allows (20–60s extra):

```ts
import { runCriticRewriteLoop, buildCriticSystemPrompt, buildCriticUserPrompt,
         buildRewritePrompt, parseCriticFeedback } from '@/lib/screenwriter-enhance';

const { finalDraft, rounds, finalScore } = await runCriticRewriteLoop({
  initialDraft: script,
  critic: async (draft) => {
    const raw = await callLLM(
      buildCriticSystemPrompt(),
      buildCriticUserPrompt(draft, storyBibleBlock),
      true,  // JSON mode
    );
    return parseCriticFeedback(raw);
  },
  rewriter: async (draft, feedback) => {
    const raw = await callLLM(
      systemPrompt,
      buildRewritePrompt(feedback, draft),
      true,
    );
    return JSON.parse(raw);
  },
  opts: { targetScore: 85, maxRounds: 2 },
  onRound: (r, s, fb) => console.log(`round ${r}: ${s}/100 — ${fb.fixes.length} fixes`),
});
```

## Cross-references (kebab-case Claude Skills convention)

This skill composes with:
- `mckee-skill` (`lib/mckee-skill.ts`) — the base McKee prompt library
- `screenwriter-xverse` (`skills/base/screenwriter-xverse.md`) — XVerse open-source LLM routing
- `seedance-enhance` (`lib/seedance-enhance.ts`) — downstream visual-consistency primitives
- `content-generation` (`skills/base/content-generation.md`) — generic generation primitives

## Quality guardrails (non-negotiables)

Even in fastest path (no critic), the Pass-1 prompt must enforce:

- **Shot 1 is a hook** — never open on "protagonist wakes up / walks / looks at view"
- **Act 1 ends with an irreversible inciting incident** — the choice can't be un-made
- **Act 2 midpoint has a reversal/cost reveal** — not smooth-sailing
- **Shot N-1 forces an irreversible choice** exposing true character
- **Emotion curve oscillates** — monotone up/down = fail
- **Every shot's start-value ≠ end-value** — "calm → calm" = waste

These are encoded in `getMcKeeWriterPrompt()` and re-stated in `buildCriticSystemPrompt()`.

## Anti-patterns

Do **NOT**:
- Feed the raw source text + enhance block + critic prompt all at once (context will blow). Split into stages.
- Run critic-rewrite more than 2 rounds — diminishing returns, over-cooking.
- Skip Story Bible when adapting existing IP — that's where consistency failures originate.
- Mix voice fingerprint register within a single character across scenes.
- Hand-edit the JSON output to "fix" the structure — re-prompt with `buildRewritePrompt()` so the critic can re-score.
