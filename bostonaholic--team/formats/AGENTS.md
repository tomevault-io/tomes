## What this is

Team is a Claude Code plugin that orchestrates specialized agents to implement features end-to-end. The orchestrator (the main Claude Code session) walks a linear phase table, and persists state as artifact files in `docs/plans/<id>/`. That per-id directory carries YAML frontmatter with phase and revision metadata. The orchestrator coordinates live progress through TodoWrite. See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the full design.

> **North star: read [docs/vision.md](docs/vision.md) and [docs/ethos.md](docs/ethos.md).** Team is a *loop-driven development system*: a human fills the Backlog and reviews finished work. Everything in between (groom → start → implement → open PR) runs autonomously. The ethos explains *why* the autonomous middle can be trusted. Every agent should understand this end state, which is the target the whole project moves toward.

## Runtime vs. development

This project produces a **distributed plugin**. Two contexts exist:

**Runtime** (`agents/`, `skills/`, `hooks/`, and the host manifest dirs `.claude-plugin/`, `.codex-plugin/`, `.agents/plugins/`) ships to end users. Fires when someone installs the Team plugin and runs `/team`. Changes here affect all users.

**Development** (`.claude/`) is our workspace tooling. Fires only when developing the plugin itself. Never distributed.

| Concern | Where it lives | Who runs it |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Pipeline agents, skills, hooks | `agents/`, `skills/`, `hooks/` | End users |
| Plugin manifests | `.claude-plugin/` (Claude Code), `.codex-plugin/` + `.agents/plugins/` (Codex) | End users |
| Registry sync validation | `.claude/hooks/check-registry-sync.mjs` | Plugin developers |
| Pre-merge version gate | `.claude/hooks/pre-merge-guard.mjs` | Plugin developers |
| Dev acceptance scripts | `.claude/scripts/` | Plugin developers |
| Dev settings/hooks | `.claude/settings.json` | Plugin developers |
| Work tracking | [GitHub Project board](https://github.com/users/bostonaholic/projects/5/views/1) | Plugin developers |
| Behavioral regression harness | `tests/`, `evals/` | Plugin developers |
| Versioning & release automation | [docs/versioning.md](docs/versioning.md), `.claude/skills/version-bump/`, `.claude/scripts/next-version.sh`, `.github/workflows/` | Plugin developers |
| Dev install, per harness | `script/dev-install`/`dev-uninstall` (dispatch), `dev-install-<harness>` | Plugin developers |

**Rule of thumb:** If it validates that the plugin is *built correctly*, it is a dev concern (`.claude/`). If it runs *as part of the plugin's functionality*, it is runtime (`hooks/`).

## Design philosophy

Agents are **decoupled microservices**. Each consumes a predecessor artifact on disk, does work, and writes its output artifact to `docs/plans/` (with YAML frontmatter on every artifact). The orchestrator walks a linear phase table in `skills/team/SKILL.md`. `skills/team/registry.json` lists the 13 agents as a phase-tagged inventory.

## Pipeline

```
WORKTREE → QUESTION → RESEARCH → DESIGN → STRUCTURE → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → PR
```

Team runs **QRSPI** (Worktree-Question-Research-Design-Structure-Plan-Implement-PR). There are **no mid-run human gates**. An adversarial design review gates the Design (~200-line alignment doc), and the orchestrator records the verdicts to `design-review-<n>.md`. The human's checkpoint is the PR review at the end. The Structure (~2-page vertical-slice breakdown) is produced autonomously and advances to Plan with no approval wait. Research is **isolated**: the researcher reads only `questions.md`, never `task.md` or the user's framing. The Plan is a tactical artifact for the implementer, not for human review. Implement is a sub-pipeline (test-first → slice execution → 5-reviewer adversarial verify with hard-gate retry loop). The whole run is autonomous with mechanical gates.

## Entry points

| Command | Phase |
|---------|-------|
| `/team <desc>` | Full 8-phase QRSPI pipeline |
| `/team-fix <bug>` | Compressed bug-fix pipeline (no QRSPI ceremony) |
| `/team-worktree` | Leading WORKTREE phase: create the home worktree. In a full run it is automatic and first. Standalone, it consumes `plan.md` post-PLAN for manual recovery or multi-repo setup |
| `/team-question <desc>` | Decompose intent into task + questions + brief |
| `/team-research` | Isolated codebase research (runs Question if missing) |
| `/team-design` | Draft the design. An adversarial design review gates advancement |
| `/eng-design-doc-review` | Adversarial fresh-context audit of `design.md`. Its Review brief doubles as the pipeline's design-review gate, and standalone use remains |
| `/team-structure` | Break design into vertical slices (autonomous) |
| `/team-plan` | Tactical plan from the structure |
| `/team-implement` | Test-first + slice execution + 5-reviewer verify |
| `/team-pr` | Commit + open PR |

## Agents (13)

See `agents/*.md`. Each agent file uses only Claude Code's [supported frontmatter fields](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agents#supported-frontmatter-fields) (no custom fields). Model tiering: haiku (mechanical), sonnet (bounded judgment), and the most capable available model for complex work (research, planning, test authoring, implementation, code review). That model is fable. Access was restored after the June 2026 suspension ([notice](https://www.anthropic.com/news/fable-mythos-access)). `security-reviewer` alone stays on opus permanently: Fable's cybersecurity classifiers refuse security-review content in non-interactive subagent contexts. See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#model-tiering) for what fable requires of plugin users and the override escape hatch. Effort tiering mirrors the model tiers: `low` (mechanical), `medium`/`high` (judgment), `xhigh` (strategic artifact authors: `design-author` and `structure-planner`). Methodology skills carry no `effort`. They inherit from the loading agent.

Four agents (`researcher`, `implementer`, `code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`) hold the `Agent` tool and may spawn read-only nested sub-agents (Claude Code ≥ 2.1.172) under the guardrails in `skills/nested-agents/SKILL.md`. Nesting is an optimization with an inline fallback, invisible to the orchestrator. See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#10-nested-sub-agents).

**Invariant:** the agent inventory in `skills/team/registry.json` (which carries the `phase` mapping) and the files under `agents/` must always agree by name. When adding or renaming an agent, update both in the same commit. The dev hook `.claude/hooks/check-registry-sync.mjs` enforces this automatically.

**Invariant (checks and balances):** producers write, reviewers judge, and no agent does both. A reviewer (`code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, `technical-writer`, `ux-reviewer`, `verifier`) holds no `Write`/`Edit` tool and carries `permissionMode: plan`. A reviewer that can edit can fix what it found and then approve its own fix, which collapses the generator and the evaluator into one role. `tests/protocol.test.ts` enforces both halves. See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#checks-and-balances).

## Skills (54)

See `skills/*/SKILL.md`. Entry point skills double as slash commands. Eight of them are standalone slash-command utilities that are not QRSPI phases. `shipit` lands a reviewed PR. `pr-open-comments` triages unresolved PR review feedback. `pr-watch-as-author` is a bounded PR review watch loop. `pr-watch-as-reviewer` is the reviewer-side watch-and-approve. `groom-backlog` grooms a project backlog with a board-level pass plus per-item promotion, and can close an issue whose premise evaporated — an irreversible public mutation, each close gated on its own per-issue approval. `pr-cleanup` tears down local and remote branch state after a PR is merged or abandoned. `pr-verify` verifies a PR's test plan with evidence-rated verdicts. `pr-rebase` rebases a branch onto its base, resolving conflicts and gating the force-push on a pre-rebase check baseline — user-invoked only (`disable-model-invocation: true`), on stated rebase intent, never on a branch merely being behind. Methodology skills are loaded by agents. For design guidelines on skill extraction and load limits, see [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md#design-guidelines).

## Hooks

**Runtime** (3, distributed with plugin):

| Hook | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `pre-compact-anchor.mjs` | PreCompact | Scan docs/plans/ for active topic, inject phase anchor before compaction |
| `session-start-recover.mjs` | SessionStart | Scan docs/plans/ for active topic, surface phase + suggested next command |
| `post-write-validate.mjs` | PostToolUse(Write\|Edit) | Structural validation of plugin files |

**Development** (in `.claude/hooks/`):

| Hook | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `check-registry-sync.mjs` | PostToolUse(Write\|Edit) | Cross-check agent frontmatter against registry.json |
| `pre-merge-guard.mjs` | PreToolUse(Bash) | Deny `gh pr merge` when the version-bump invariant fails. Gates only a literal `gh pr merge` Bash tool call in a session that loaded `.claude/settings.json` — UI, raw-terminal, and wrapped merges bypass it (see [docs/versioning.md](docs/versioning.md)) |

## State

State is the set of artifacts in `docs/plans/<id>/*.md`, where `<id>` is `<TICKET>-<topic>` or `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<topic>`. Each artifact carries YAML frontmatter (`topic`, `date`, `phase`). `design.md` also carries `revision`, and review verdicts live in `design-review-<n>.md`. Live in-session coordination uses TodoWrite (session-scoped). Any `/team-*` command rebuilds the ledger by scanning artifacts on entry. See [docs/architecture.md section 9](docs/architecture.md#9-state-management) for the full compaction-defense explanation.

## Learned rules

- **No `commands/` directory.** Skills are the only entry point mechanism. They auto-register as slash commands.
- **No project-scoped memory.** Do not save memories to `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/`. All project knowledge belongs in this file or docs linked from here. This file is checked into git and travels with the project.
- **Todo-first progress tracking.** Any agent or skill that executes a multi-step numbered procedure seeds one TodoWrite item per step before starting and marks each complete as it goes. See `skills/progress-tracking/SKILL.md` for the convention and ledger-ownership rules.
- **A drafted PR carries no version. Nothing versions until the step immediately before the merge command.** Bullets accumulate under `## [Unreleased]`; the five version strings, the dated changelog section, and the `vX.Y.Z` PR-title prefix all stay untouched until that step. **"Land time" means exactly that moment, never "when the work is done"** — a version assigned at PR-open time is computed against a `main` that keeps moving, so it goes stale as soon as another PR lands and the pre-merge guard then denies the merge. Team versions itself through the dev `version-bump` skill, which fires **only on explicit land intent** and never on work merely looking landable, then lands through the generic `/shipit`. **The bump is also conditional on a runtime change, not universal:** only a PR that changes the **distributed plugin** (per the runtime-vs-development split above) bumps; a dev-only PR (CI, docs, tests, evals, `.claude/` tooling) lands with no bump, no changelog cut, and a plain conventional title. The deterministic gate `.github/scripts/version-bump-required.sh` (pinned by `tests/version-bump-required.test.ts`) states a *merge* precondition, so its exit 1 on an unbumped runtime branch is the expected state throughout review rather than a cue to bump; `version-bump` runs it early, and the pre-merge dev hook (`.claude/hooks/pre-merge-guard.mjs`) denies the merge command on either violation. Full land-time procedure: `.claude/skills/version-bump/SKILL.md` (Team's internal bumper) and `skills/shipit/SKILL.md` (project-agnostic, does no versioning). See [docs/versioning.md](docs/versioning.md).
- **Read docs/testing.md before writing any test.** Before adding or modifying ANY test (unit, tripwire, eval, fixture, or rubric), read [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md) end to end and understand it. It decides *which layer* a check belongs at, so push every check as far down and as deterministic as it goes. It also decides if the check is free (`*.test.ts`) or paid (`*.evals.ts`), and if it gates or runs periodically. A test written at the wrong layer is worse than no test: it is slow, flaky, or costs money to learn nothing. No exceptions: this applies to agents, skills, and humans alike.

## Behavioral evals

Behavioral regression harness for pipeline agents, built on TypeScript + Bun. Harness code lives in `tests/`. Fixtures, rubrics, and stored runs live in `evals/`. `bun test` runs the free static gate. `bun run test:evals` runs the paid E2E and LLM-judge tiers (needs `EVALS_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). See [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md) for the six-layer testing strategy (what each layer is and which files implement it) and [evals/README.md](evals/README.md) for the operator's guide.

## Work tracking

All work, including features, bugs, and chores, is tracked on the [GitHub Project board](https://github.com/users/bostonaholic/projects/5/views/1). It is the single source of truth. If work is not on the board, it is not tracked. Create a GitHub issue in `bostonaholic/team` and add it to the project. Then move its card across the kanban (**Backlog → Ready → In progress → In review → Done**) as the work progresses. See [docs/project-tracking.md](docs/project-tracking.md) for the full workflow.

**Every issue carries a `Priority`** (`P0`, `P1`, or `P2`), set when it is created. An unprioritized issue is untriaged. **Every `bug` is `P0`**, because bugs take precedence over features and enhancements. See [docs/project-tracking.md](docs/project-tracking.md#creating-work).
