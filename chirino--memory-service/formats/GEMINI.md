# Memory Service

A memory service for AI agents that stores messages exchanged with LLMs and users, supporting conversation replay and forking.

**Self-Updating Knowledge:**
When you discover something meaningful about this project during your work—architecture patterns, naming conventions, gotchas, dependency quirks, correct/incorrect assumptions in existing docs — update `AGENTS.md` (or the relevant skill file) immediately so future sessions benefit without re-discovering it. Specifically:

- **Correct** any skill or doc content you find to be outdated or wrong.
- **Refine trigger criteria** in skill descriptions if a skill was loaded but wasn't relevant to the task—tighten its description so it activates more precisely.
- Keep updates concise and factual. Don't bloat files with obvious or generic information.
- Module specific knowlege should be placed into a `FACTS.md` in the top level directory of that module to avoid poluting AGENTS.md

## Key Concepts
- **Agent apps mediate all operations**: Agent apps are the primary consumers. They sit between end users and the memory service, mediating all interactions.
- **Agent API**: For agent apps - manage conversations, append entries, retrieve context for LLMs. Some agent APIs are designed to be safely exposed to frontend apps (e.g., SPAs) for features like listing conversations, semantic search, viewing messages, and forking.
- **Admin API**: For administrative operations and system management.
- **User access control**: Conversations are owned by users with read/write/manager/owner access levels.
- **Data stores**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB; Redis, Infinispan (caching); PGVector, Qdrant (vector search).
- **Porting Server To Go**: we are porting the ./memory-service java module to ./main.go
- **dev mode**: `task dev:memory-service` runs the go-based memory service using [air](https://github.com/air-verse/air) for hot reloading on port 8082 and it's dependencies get started with docker compose.
- **Local developer tooling policy**: `compose.yaml` and `task dev*` prioritize zero-configuration ease of use over production security hardening; keep demo credentials and avoid mandatory secret-generation setup. Embedded MCP has the same single-user desktop assumption.

## Quick Reference

**Build**: `./java/mvnw -f java/pom.xml` (Maven Wrapper)

**Essential commands**:
- `./java/mvnw -f java/pom.xml test` - run Java/Quarkus/Spring tests
- `./java/mvnw -f java/pom.xml compile` - compile Java modules (always run after Java changes)
- `task verify:python` - regenerate Python gRPC stubs and validate the LangChain package build/install (runs in Docker)
- `task dev:memory-service` - backend dev mode (:8082)
- `go test ./internal/bdd -run TestFeaturesPgKeycloak -count=1` - Go BDD runner for Postgres + Keycloak OIDC integration
- `cd memory-service-mcp && go build -o mcp-server .` - build the standalone MCP server binary

**Key paths**:
- `contracts/` - OpenAPI (`contracts/openapi/`) and protobuf (`contracts/protobuf/`) sources of truth
- `main.go` + `internal/` - core Go implementation
- `deploy/dev/air.toml` - local Air live-reload config for `task dev:memory-service`
- `deploy/docker/prometheus.yml` - local Docker Compose Prometheus scrape config
- `java/quarkus/examples/chat-quarkus/` - Demo chat app (Quarkus)
- `java/spring/examples/chat-spring/` - Demo chat app (Spring)
- `frontends/chat-frontend/` - Demo chat app frontend (React)
- `internal/sitebdd/` - Documentation test module (MDX `<TestScenario>/<CurlTest>` to Go/Cucumber pipeline)
- `internal/cmd/mcp/` - MCP server integrated into main binary (`./memory-service mcp`)
- `memory-service-mcp/` - Standalone MCP binary wrapper (build with `cd memory-service-mcp && go build -o mcp-server .`; `.mcp.json` uses `${PWD}` for portable paths)
- Current Go MCP implementation is HTTP/OpenAPI-based through `internal/generated/apiclient`; it does not use gRPC today, so embedded MCP designs only need an in-process HTTP path unless they explicitly add new gRPC consumers.
- MCP CLI split: main binary now uses explicit `./memory-service mcp remote` and `./memory-service mcp embedded` subcommands, while `memory-service-mcp` remains a single-command remote wrapper.

**API gotchas**:
- Conversation search endpoint is `/v1/conversations/search` (not `/v1/search`).
- Fork creation is implicit on first append to a new conversation ID using `forkedAtConversationId` + `forkedAtEntryId`; `POST /v1/conversations/{conversationId}/entries/{entryId}/fork` is obsolete.
- Entry listing uses `forks=all` to return entries from all branches in a fork tree (not `allForks=true`).
- Conversation archive semantics: user/admin conversation deletes are replaced by PATCH/update with synthetic `archived`; conversation list filters now use `archived=exclude|include|only`; archived conversations remain readable until eviction hard-deletes them.
- Historical enhancement docs `013`, `014`, `017`, `062`, `068`, `073`, and `090` still contain pre-094 delete/archive terminology in their body text; use `docs/enhancements/implemented/094-archive-operations.md`, current OpenAPI/proto contracts, and current site docs as the source of truth for archive behavior.
- Enhancement doc `implemented/007-multi-agent-support.md` is older agent-scoped memory work; do not treat it as the design for parent/child agent conversations or conversation-lineage APIs.
- Current `clientId` semantics are app/system identity, not logical agent identity; multi-agent apps may need multiple `agentId` values under one authenticated client.
- Conversation `clientId` is internal/admin-only metadata: user-facing REST conversation payloads must not expose it, while admin conversation APIs may.
- Conversation identity migration status: public contracts and conversation APIs now use conversation-level `clientId` plus optional conversation-level `agentId`, but Go stores still persist entry-level `clientId`/`agentId` and still use agent-scoped context cache/query paths internally; Enhancement 089 is partial, not complete.
- API parity rule: when enhancing an agent REST API, inspect and update the corresponding agent gRPC, admin REST, and admin gRPC APIs where the operation is meaningful. Keep OpenAPI/protobuf contracts, server handlers, datastore queries, generated clients, documentation, and BDD coverage aligned; if a surface intentionally differs, document the reason explicitly. For conversation list/detail/update changes, verify both public and admin summary/detail payloads, filters, and mutation requests.
- Conversation metadata parity: agent REST and gRPC expose metadata in conversation summaries, metadata merge-patching, metadata list filtering, and inline `conversationPatch` on entry append/sync. Admin REST/gRPC also expose metadata in summaries, support title+metadata merge-patch in PATCH/UpdateConversation, and support metadata key-value list filtering. Keep all four surfaces (agent REST, agent gRPC, admin REST, admin gRPC) aligned when adding new conversation update or list capabilities.
- Conversation metadata filter contract: `GET /v1/conversations` uses OpenAPI `deepObject` style for `metadata[key]=value` filtering; the generated `ListConversationsParams.Metadata` is `*map[string]string`. Metadata filter keys may only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens — dots are rejected because Postgres, SQLite, and MongoDB interpret dots differently in filter paths. The same key-validation rule applies to admin list filtering. Filters match only scalar string values; arrays containing the requested string must not match.
- Conversation metadata patch semantics are top-level, not recursive RFC 7396: a non-null value replaces the complete value at that top-level key, null deletes the key, and absent keys remain unchanged.
- Archived guard on AppendEntries/SyncAgentEntry: all three stores block writes to archived conversations in `AppendEntries` and `SyncAgentEntry` by returning `NotFoundError`. To unarchive and append atomically, use `conversationPatch.archived=false` in the request — the handler calls `UnarchiveConversation` before the store write so the guard passes. `UpdateConversation` (title/metadata only) does NOT check archive state.
- conversationPatch.archived semantics: setting `archived=false` in `conversationPatch` unarchives the conversation BEFORE the entry write (enabling "unarchive then append" in one call); setting `archived=true` archives it AFTER. The archived and plain no-archived-field cases differ in handler order; `applyValidatedConversationPatch` and `applyValidatedGRPCConversationPatch` accept an `archivedAlreadyHandled` bool to avoid double-unarchive.
- MongoDB InWriteTx non-atomic gotcha: `MongoStore.InWriteTx` is intent-only and does not open a real multi-document MongoDB session transaction. `conversationPatch` on Mongo is therefore not truly atomic — see WORKAROUNDS.md.
- No-op sync with conversationPatch: when `syncMemory`/`SyncEntries` results in a no-op (no entry written) but a `conversationPatch` was applied, the handler emits a `conversation/updated` SSE/gRPC event. The group ID is resolved via `GetConversation` in that case.
- Metadata indexing: Postgres uses a GIN index on `conversations.metadata` with `jsonb_path_ops` for efficient key-value filter lookups; MongoDB uses a `metadata.$**` wildcard index named `conversations_metadata_wildcard`; SQLite relies on expression-level `json_extract` without a dedicated index (acceptable for development/small-scale deployments).
- Conversation ancestry closure status: fork lineage uses `conversation_ancestry` (SQL table / Mongo collection) as the source of truth for public direct-fork metadata and bounded entry listing. The breaking datastore baseline restarts at schema version 1 and rejects all earlier layouts; do not add dependencies on direct fork columns/doc fields on conversations.
- Fork navigation: user-facing `/v1/conversations/{id}/forks` returns a complete `{conversationIds, forkPoints}` navigation snapshot keyed to entries visible in the requested conversation. Admin fork listing retains its paginated direct-child summary semantics.
- Async sub-agent orchestration now uses explicit model-facing control tools instead of implicit end-of-turn joins. The Quarkus default tool names are `agentSend`, `agentPoll`, `waitTask`, and `agentStop`; follow-up messages to an existing running child conversation require an explicit mode such as `queue` or `interrupt`.
- In gRPC `memory/v1/memory_service.proto`, response recorder fields use snake_case (`conversation_id`).
- In gRPC `EventStreamService.SubscribeEvents`, `SubscribeEventsRequest.conversation_ids` is applied as a narrowing filter, not as an authorization grant. Admin scope uses it to limit the all-events stream to selected conversations; authorized/user scope still applies membership filtering first.
- Response recording naming is intentionally split by scope: client-side lifecycle APIs use `ResponseRecordingManager` / `RecordingSession`, while record-only server/proto pieces use `ResponseRecorderService` and recorder handles; avoid renaming the umbrella concept back to `ResponseRecorder`.
- Event stream routing is now user-scoped: publish paths resolve recipient user IDs up front, REST/gRPC `/v1/events` subscribers subscribe by authenticated user, and Redis/PostgreSQL transports fan out on per-user channels plus shared broadcast/admin channels instead of broadcasting every business event to every subscriber.
- Dev Postgres outbox gotcha: `task dev:memory-service` and `compose.yaml` enable `MEMORY_SERVICE_OUTBOX_ENABLED=true`; PostgreSQL outbox startup now requires the backing Postgres server to run with `wal_level=logical` plus replication slots/senders enabled, or startup fails while creating the logical replication slot.
- Cognition replay gotcha: the current `quay.io/rigazilla/cognitive-memory:cd-latest` image logs "starting from beginning" when no checkpoint exists but sends a null gRPC `after_cursor`, which selects tail-only mode. Durable replay from the oldest retained event requires `after_cursor: "start"`.
- Keycloak realm gotcha: every browser client that calls Memory Service must add the `memory-service` audience to access tokens; Compose enforces this with `MEMORY_SERVICE_OIDC_ALLOWED_AUDIENCES=memory-service`.
- Postgres store gotcha: inside route-scoped transactions, use `dbFor(ctx)` / `writeDBFor(ctx, ...)` rather than `s.db.WithContext(ctx)` for reads/writes that must see uncommitted work. Using the base handle breaks sync auto-create flows and cache warming because conversation-group inserts and entry/cache reads can land on different transactions.
- SQLite multi-process gotcha: `sharedHandle.writeMu` serializes write scopes only within one process, and the runtime DSN does not set `_txlock=immediate`; two service processes sharing one SQLite file can therefore contend during deferred read-to-write transaction upgrades and return SQLite busy/locked errors. Use PostgreSQL for multi-replica deployments that need reliable concurrent writes.
- List endpoints may include `"afterCursor": null`; docs-test JSON assertions should tolerate additive pagination fields.
- Attachment download tokens (`/v1/attachments/download/:token/:filename`) are HMAC-signed with keys derived from the configured encryption provider; the DEK provider uses HKDF-SHA256 over `MEMORY_SERVICE_ENCRYPTION_DEK_KEY`. `MEMORY_SERVICE_ATTACHMENT_SIGNING_SECRET` is obsolete. Without provider signing keys, the generated public route remains registered but rejects tokens and download-URL issuance is unavailable.
- Go cache serialization gotcha: `model.Entry` has custom JSON marshaling for `content`; keep marshal/unmarshal behavior symmetric or cached memory entries lose content and break sync/list semantics.
- Repo-root Docker build gotcha: the release `Dockerfile` builds without `.git` metadata in context, so Go commands in that image must use `-buildvcs=false` or `go build` fails with `error obtaining VCS status`.
- Devcontainer Go gotcha: keep `go.mod` using a language version in the `go` directive (for example `go 1.24`) and put patch-level pinning in `toolchain go1.24.6`; if `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` installs an older Go version, Go auto-downloads the newer toolchain into `GOPATH`, so keep `/go` writable by `vscode` (or set `GOPATH` to a user-owned path) to avoid `mkdir .../golang.org/toolchain: permission denied`.
- Devcontainer site-test gotcha: `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` needs `libsqlite3-dev` installed or `task test:site` / `go build -tags='site_tests sqlite_fts5' ./internal/sitebdd/` fails while compiling `github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec-go-bindings` with `fatal error: sqlite3.h: No such file or directory`.
- Windows Go build status: SQLite vector support is disabled on Windows with build tags, while the regular SQLite store remains enabled. Windows builds that include SQLite still require CGO and a Windows C toolchain because the store uses `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`; `GOOS=windows CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./...` fails in the SQLite driver. CI/release matrices do not publish Windows artifacts.
- Memory usage counters increment only on direct fetch reads (`GET /v1/memories`, gRPC `GetMemory`); search endpoints can return usage metadata with `include_usage` but do not increment counters.
- Quarkus REST client module builds can require `-am` (`./java/mvnw -f java/pom.xml -pl quarkus/memory-service-rest-quarkus -am ...`) so `memory-service-contracts` is built in the same reactor.
- Site-doc checkpoint builds run as standalone Maven apps; after changing shared Java snapshot modules they depend on, use `./java/mvnw -f java/pom.xml -pl <module> -am install -DskipTests` rather than only `compile`, or site tests may keep using stale artifacts from `~/.m2`.
- The demo Quarkus image Dockerfile lives at `./java/quarkus/examples/chat-quarkus/Dockerfile`; repo-root compose/task commands should use that path.
- Kustomize kind gotcha: `deploy/kustomize/envs/kind/base` is a Component and does not build standalone; validate it through `deploy/kustomize/envs/kind/overlays/postgresql-infinispan` and `deploy/kustomize/envs/kind/overlays/mongodb-redis`.
- Contract specs live in repo-root `contracts/`; Java modules should resolve them from `${maven.multiModuleProjectDirectory}/../contracts`, and the `java/memory-service-contracts` module publishes them via `../../contracts`.
- The Maven wrapper and reactor root live under `java/`; repo-root Maven commands must use `./java/mvnw -f java/pom.xml ...`.
- BDD event-stream matrix: keep broad datastore suites on their default config, and cover outbox behavior with dedicated runners (`TestFeaturesPgOutbox`, `TestFeaturesSQLiteOutbox`, `TestFeaturesMongoOutbox`). PostgreSQL is the only gRPC outbox suite; SQLite and Mongo outbox coverage is REST-only.
- Release workflow: `.github/workflows/release.yml` is a manual Java/Docker/binary release job. It creates `release/vX.Y.Z` or merges the workflow's source commit into an existing release branch before committing Maven version changes, builds and smoke-tests native memory-service binaries for linux/amd64, linux/arm64, and macos/arm64, then stages them into release-only Maven provider JARs before publishing the complete Java artifact set to Maven Central. It also builds GHCR Docker images as per-platform digest pushes on native amd64/arm64 runners, assembles the final multi-platform Docker tags with `docker buildx imagetools create`, tags `vX.Y.Z`, attaches binary ZIPs to the GitHub Release when enabled, then deletes the release branch after success; reruns tolerate existing tags/releases and already-published artifacts. Ordinary and snapshot Maven builds publish `memory-service-process` but do not activate the native-JAR profile. Python and TypeScript packages are intentionally excluded.
- Docker release tag inputs update `latest` and the stable `X.Y` compatibility tag by default, with independent opt-outs. Prerelease versions never update the `X.Y` tag.
- Windows Go build status: the default Go server build is not Windows-clean because SQLite vector support depends on CGO-only `github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec-go-bindings/cgo`, while Windows cross-builds from macOS need a Windows CGO toolchain. A reduced TCP-only main binary currently cross-compiles with `GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -tags 'nosqlite nouds' .`; CI/release matrices do not publish Windows artifacts.


## Development Guidelines

**Security**: Don't commit secrets; pass them with env vars
**Commits**: Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`). Include test commands and config changes.

## Notes for AI Assistants

**Verify only changed modules (required)**:
- Go changes (`main.go`, `internal/`, `go.mod`, `go.sum`, etc.): run Go build for affected packages (use `go build ./...` when scope is broad).
- Java/Quarkus/Spring changes: run Maven compile for affected modules (prefer `-pl` targeted modules; use full `./java/mvnw -f java/pom.xml compile` only when scope is broad).
- Frontend changes (`frontends/chat-frontend/`): run `npm run lint && npm run build` from `frontends/chat-frontend/`.
- Python changes (`python/`): run `python3 -m compileall` on changed files/modules; run `task verify:python` when Python packaging/stubs are impacted.
- Cross-stack or uncertain impact: run all relevant checks above; full-repo compile is optional unless needed by the change scope.

**Taskfile shell compatibility**: Task commands execute via `sh`; use POSIX redirection (`>/dev/null 2>&1`) instead of shell-specific forms like `&>` or malformed `2&>1`.
- **Java/site test concurrency gotcha**: Do not run `task test:java` and `task test:site` concurrently in the same worktree. Both invoke Maven clean/build against Java targets and can race, producing failures such as `Failed to delete .../target`, `error reading .../target/generated-sources/...`, or missing generated client classes. Run them sequentially or in isolated worktrees.
- **Generate task gotcha**: `task generate` creates frontend `node_modules` before Go generation; Go generation should stay scoped to the repo-root `go generate .` directive instead of expanding `./...`, which traverses frontend `node_modules` and build-tag-only packages.
- **TypeScript example task gotcha**: Under `typescript/examples/vecelai/doc-checkpoints/`, both `05-response-resumption/` and `05b-response-resumption/` exist; keep `Taskfile.yml` entries explicit instead of assuming a sequential directory list.

**Test output strategy**: When running tests, redirect output to a file and search for errors instead of using `| tail`. This ensures you see all relevant error context:
```bash
task test:go > test.log 2>&1
# Then search for errors using Grep tool on test.log
```

**Module-specific knowledge** lives in `FACTS.md` files within each module directory:
- `./frontends/chat-frontend/FACTS.md`
- `./frontends/developer/FACTS.md`
- `./java/memory-service-contracts/FACTS.md`
- `./java/memory-service-process/FACTS.md`
- `./java/quarkus/FACTS.md`
- `./python/FACTS.md`
- `./internal/sitebdd/FACTS.md`
- `./internal/FACTS.md`
- `./site/FACTS.md`
- `./java/spring/FACTS.md`

**Data compatibility**: DB schema/data changes must preserve existing data through migrations. Do not assume datastores can be reset for breaking changes. When changing persisted structures, update the relevant schema/migration files and add or adjust tests that validate upgrade behavior where practical. API cleanup can still remove pre-release surface area when requested, but persisted data transitions need an explicit migration path.

**Enhancement docs**: Proposed enhancements stay in `docs/enhancements/`. Non-proposed enhancements live in `docs/enhancements/<status>/` where status is `implemented`, `partial`, or `superseded`. When implementing work from `docs/enhancements/`, update the corresponding enhancement doc as you complete each phase. If the implementation diverges from the original design, update the doc to reflect what was actually implemented.

**Workarounds**: If you implement a workaround (e.g., to avoid a bug, limitation, or missing feature in a dependency), you MUST:
1. Record it in `./WORKAROUNDS.md` with: what the workaround is, why it was needed, and what a proper fix might look like.
2. Inform the user that a workaround was added so they can decide whether to accept it or pursue a better solution.
