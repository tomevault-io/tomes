## Purpose

Perform quick quality pass on current diffs to surface risky areas, ensure polish, and flag follow-up actions for deeper review.

## Steps

1. **Scan recent changes**: List open branches or pending commits requiring review, skim side-by-side diffs focusing on new/modified files, note files/modules with large/complex edits
2. **Assess quality signals**: Watch for TODOs/debug code/commented blocks needing cleanup, verify naming/formatting/imports follow project standards, check that tests/documentation were updated when behavior changed
3. **Flag next actions**: Mark sections warranting full review, capture questions for the author, and list quick fixes. Apply edits only if the user asked for them.

## Completion

Read [completion evidence](../references/completion.md) before reporting completion.
