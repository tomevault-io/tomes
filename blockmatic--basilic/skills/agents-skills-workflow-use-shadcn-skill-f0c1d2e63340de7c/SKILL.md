## Purpose

Build shadcn/ui components following monorepo structure and coding standards.

## Steps

1. **Use MCP servers**: Use `shadcnui-official` for single components/variants/canonical patterns, use `shadcnui-jpisnice-react` for full blocks/demos/page templates, only call MCP when unsure about implementation or encountering errors
2. **Install in `@repo/ui`**: Install components in `packages/ui/src/components/`, ensure `components.json` points to `@repo/ui/lib/utils` and `@repo/ui/components`, follow existing component organization patterns
3. **Follow monorepo import patterns**: Import from `@repo/ui/components/*` never directly from packages/ui, use `@repo/ui/lib/utils` for utilities like `cn`, import Radix primitives from `@repo/ui/radix` never directly from `@radix-ui/react-*`
4. **Apply coding standards**: Follow TypeScript rules (interfaces, type inference, RORO pattern), use class-variance-authority (cva) for variants, apply mobile-first responsive design, follow linting rules (Biome + ESLint)
5. **Verify and test**: Run `pnpm lint:fix` to ensure code quality, verify imports work correctly in consuming apps, test component functionality and responsiveness
6. **Surfaces, not only primitives**: After the component is installed, reshape screens with `/use-frontend` — do not treat a new primitive as the whole UI job
