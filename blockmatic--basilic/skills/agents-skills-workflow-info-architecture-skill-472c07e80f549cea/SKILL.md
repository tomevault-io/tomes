## Purpose and inputs

Improve discoverability of files and docs without discarding information. Durable documentation topology is `/f-info-architect`. Ask before renaming or moving trees.

## Steps

1. Map the current layout against repository file-organization rules and docs MDX. Load `/f-info-architect` if the change is durable IA.
2. Propose groupings, kebab-case names, and shallower trees. Do not invent a second docs hierarchy.
3. Show the proposed moves. Apply only after the user confirms destructive renames.
4. Update imports and cross-references in the same work. Preserve unrelated files.

## Verification

- [ ] Proposed moves follow existing file-organization rules.
- [ ] User confirmed before bulk rename/move.
- [ ] Affected imports or doc links were updated.

## Handoff

Return the proposal or the applied moves. Durable IA decisions still go through `/f-info-architect`.
