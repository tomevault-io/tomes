2. **Branch Management**: Help with branch cleanup/organization, suggest rebasing vs merging strategies, assist with cherry-picking, guide through complex branch operations
3. **Commit History**: Help with commit message improvements, assist with squashing/organizing commits, guide through interactive rebase, fix commit authorship/metadata
4. **Repository Issues**: Help recover from detached HEAD state, assist with undoing commits/changes, guide through stash management, resolve submodule/remote issues
