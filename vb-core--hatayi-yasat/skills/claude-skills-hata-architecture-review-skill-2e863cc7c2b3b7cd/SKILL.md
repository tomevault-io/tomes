description: Audit the overall architecture & convention health of the life_client codebase (the whole repo or a given feature/folder) against CLAUDE.md — Riverpod @riverpod ViewModel pattern, Equatable+copyWith state, DI via mixins, view conventions, go_router typed routes, styling tokens, structure/naming. Runs static analysis, delegates a deep pass to the hata-architecture-reviewer agent, and produces one severity-ranked report. Use when the user asks to check the architecture, e.g. "mimariyi kontrol et", "proje konvansiyonlarına uyuyor mu", "şu feature mimariye uygun mu", "architecture review". Use when this capability is needed.

# life_client Architecture Review

Audits a **part of the codebase for conformance to project conventions**
([CLAUDE.md](../../../CLAUDE.md)). Unlike `hata-pr-review` (which reviews a *diff*),
this reviews **structure** — an existing feature or the whole `lib/` tree. It
**reports**, it does not fix.

## When to invoke
- "Mimariyi kontrol et", "proje konvansiyonlarına uyuyor mu", "şu feature uygun mu", "architecture review", "tech-debt audit".

## When NOT to invoke
- Reviewing a PR/diff before merge → `hata-pr-review`.
- Building a feature → `hata-feature`.
- UI token lookup → `hata-style-guide`.

## Inputs (resolve the scope first)
1. **Feature/folder named** → review just that (e.g. `lib/features/main/home`).
2. **No scope given** → ask whether to audit a specific feature or the whole `lib/` (whole-repo is large; prefer scoping). Default to the feature(s) most relevant to the user's recent work.

## Passes (merge into one ranked list)

### Pass A — Static analysis (run first, in parallel)
```bash
dart analyze <scope>
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed <scope>
```
Surface every analyzer error/warning as a finding (non-negotiable).

### Pass B — Deep conformance (delegate)
Hand the file list (and, for a feature, its full contents) to the
[hata-architecture-reviewer](../../agents/hata-architecture-reviewer.md) agent. It
checks the `@riverpod`+Notifier pattern, `state = copyWith` mutation, Equatable
`props`/`copyWith` completeness, `ProjectDependencyMixin`/`AppProviderMixin` DI,
`GetIt.I`-in-view, no-Freezed, view conventions, typed routes, folder/naming, and
returns severity-ranked findings.

### Pass C — Token/style sweep (grep, confirm in context)
```bash
grep -rnE 'EdgeInsets\.(all|symmetric|only)|Colors\.|Color\(0x|Theme\.of\(context\)|BorderRadius\.circular\(|GetIt\.I|@freezed|extends StatefulWidget' <scope> --include='*.dart' \
  | grep -vE '\.g\.dart|\.freezed\.dart' || echo "no obvious violations"
```
A hit is a smell, not proof — a `Color(0x..)` in a theme/`ColorsCustom` file is allowed; in a view it is a blocker. Also flag hardcoded UI strings that should be `LocaleKeys.*.tr()`.

## Severity rubric
Same as the reviewer agent: **error** (CLAUDE.md rule break — `GetIt.I` in view, Freezed, direct VM mutation, hardcoded color/EdgeInsets in view, plain `StatefulWidget`, field missing from `props`/`copyWith`), **warning** (logic in view, no decomposition, raw `Text`+`TextStyle`, hardcoded string, wrong structure), **info** (nits).

## Output contract
```
## Architecture review: <scope> — <N blocker, N warning, N info>

### 🔴 Blockers
- [<file>:<line>](<file>#L<line>) — <what & CLAUDE.md section>. Fix: <concrete fix>.

### 🟡 Warnings
- [<file>:<line>](<file>#L<line>) — <issue>. Fix: <concrete fix>.

### 🔵 Suggestions
- [<file>:<line>](<file>#L<line>) — <nit>.

### ✅ Conforms
- <what the code already does right>.

### Verdict
**<HEALTHY | NEEDS WORK>** — <one sentence>. <blocker count> must-fix.
```
Rules: every finding cites a real `file:line`; concrete fixes; de-dup across passes (report once at highest severity); omit empty sections but keep **Verdict**. Do not edit files unless the user explicitly asks afterward (then route fixes through `hata-feature`).
