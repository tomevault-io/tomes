# Auditing Test Quality

Systematically audit test quality to identify vanity tests and guide improvement.

## What you should do
Automate test quality assessment, identify vanity tests, and guide systematic improvement of test suites.

## Prerequisites
- Test audit script available (usually `scripts/audit_tests.py` or `make audit-tests`)
- Project follows behavioral test naming conventions
- Mock and assertion counting tools configured

## Workflow

### Step 1: Run test quality audit

```bash
# Run the audit script
python scripts/audit_tests.py
# or
make audit-tests
# or
npm run audit:tests
```

Expected output format:
```
Test Quality Audit Report
=========================

ISSUES FOUND: 12

tests/unit/test_user_service.py:
  - test_save_user: Non-behavioral test name
  - test_get_user: Too many mocks (7)
  - test_update_user: Poor mock-to-assertion ratio (1/4)

tests/integration/test_api.py:
  - test_endpoint: Non-behavioral test name
  - test_auth: Poor mock-to-assertion ratio (2/6)

SUMMARY:
  Total tests examined: 45
  Tests with issues: 12 (26.7%)
  Issues by type:
    - Non-behavioral names: 8
    - Too many mocks: 2
    - Poor mock ratio: 4
    - Vanity tests: 3
```

### Step 2: Prioritize issues by severity

**High priority (fix immediately):**
- Tests with >5 mocks
- Tests with only mock assertions (no behavior verification)
- Tests that would pass with broken functionality

**Medium priority (fix this sprint):**
- Tests with poor mock-to-assertion ratio (<3:1)
- Tests with implementation-focused names
- Tests mocking internal business logic

**Low priority (fix when touching code):**
- Tests with vague names but correct behavior
- Tests with minor mock discipline violations

### Step 3: Fix high-priority issues

For each high-priority test:

1. **Analyze the test purpose**: What behavior should it verify?
2. **Identify true dependencies**: What actually needs mocking?
3. **Rewrite the test**:
   - Use behavioral naming: `test_should_X_when_Y`
   - Reduce mocks to external dependencies only
   - Add meaningful assertions about outcomes
   - Verify the test fails when functionality breaks

Example transformation:
```python
# BEFORE (vanity test)
def test_save_user():
    mock_db = Mock()
    service = UserService(mock_db)
    service.save(user_data)
    mock_db.save.assert_called_once_with(user_data)

# AFTER (behavioral test)
def test_should_return_user_id_when_saving_valid_user():
    # Use real objects where possible
    service = UserService(in_memory_repository)
    user_data = {"name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"}

    user_id = service.save(user_data)

    # Verify actual behavior
    assert user_id is not None
    assert service.find_by_id(user_id).name == "John"
    assert service.find_by_id(user_id).email == "john@example.com"
```

### Step 4: Fix medium-priority issues

**Improving mock-to-assertion ratios:**
```python
# BEFORE: Poor ratio (1 assertion, 3 mocks)
def test_user_creation():
    mock_db = Mock()
    mock_email = Mock()
    mock_logger = Mock()
    service = UserService(mock_db, mock_email, mock_logger)

    service.create_user({"email": "test@example.com"})

    mock_db.save.assert_called_once()  # Only 1 assertion

# AFTER: Good ratio (4+ assertions, 3 mocks)
def test_should_create_user_and_send_welcome_email_when_valid_data():
    mock_db = Mock()
    mock_email = Mock()
    mock_logger = Mock()
    service = UserService(mock_db, mock_email, mock_logger)

    result = service.create_user({"email": "test@example.com"})

    # Multiple meaningful assertions
    assert result["status"] == "created"
    assert result["user_id"] is not None
    mock_db.save.assert_called_once()
    mock_email.send_welcome.assert_called_once_with("test@example.com")
    assert mock_logger.info.call_count >= 1
```

**Improving test names:**
```python
# BEFORE: Implementation-focused names
def test_uses_bcrypt_hash()
def test_calls_api_endpoint()
def test_saves_to_database()

# AFTER: Behavior-focused names
def test_should_hash_password_when_user_registers()
def test_should_return_user_data_when_valid_token_provided()
def test_should_persist_user_when_registration_completes()
```

### Step 5: Remove vanity tests

For tests that only verify mocks were called:
1. **Check if behavior is covered elsewhere**: If yes, delete the vanity test
2. **If not covered**: Rewrite to test actual behavior
3. **Consider integration tests**: Some behaviors need higher-level testing

### Step 6: Re-run audit and verify improvements

```bash
# Run audit again to confirm fixes
python scripts/audit_tests.py

# Verify tests still pass
make test

# Check that tests fail when functionality breaks
# (Temporarily break a function and confirm its tests fail)
```

### Step 7: Update audit baseline

```bash
# Update the expected audit results
python scripts/audit_tests.py --update-baseline

# Or commit the new audit report as baseline
git add audit_results.json
git commit -m "test: update quality audit baseline after improvements"
```

## Automation setup

### Pre-commit hook
```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: test-quality-audit
        name: Test quality audit
        entry: python scripts/audit_tests.py
        language: system
        pass_filenames: false
        files: ^tests/.*\.py$
```

### CI integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test-quality.yml
name: Test Quality
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: 3.9
      - name: Run test quality audit
        run: |
          python scripts/audit_tests.py
          if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo "Test quality issues found. See report above."
            exit 1
          fi
```

### Makefile target
```makefile
audit-tests: ## Run test quality audit
	@echo "Running test quality audit..."
	@python scripts/audit_tests.py
	@if [ $$? -eq 0 ]; then \
		echo "✅ All tests pass quality checks"; \
	else \
		echo "❌ Test quality issues found"; \
		exit 1; \
	fi
```

## Audit script customization

### Language-specific configurations

**Python (pytest):**
```python
MOCK_PATTERNS = ['mock', 'Mock', 'patch', 'MagicMock']
ASSERTION_PATTERNS = ['assert', 'assertEqual', 'assertTrue']
BEHAVIORAL_KEYWORDS = ['should', 'when', 'given', 'returns', 'rejects']
```

**JavaScript (Jest):**
```javascript
const MOCK_PATTERNS = ['jest.fn', 'mock', 'spy', 'stub'];
const ASSERTION_PATTERNS = ['expect', 'toBe', 'toEqual', 'assert'];
const BEHAVIORAL_KEYWORDS = ['should', 'when', 'given', 'returns', 'rejects'];
```

**Java (JUnit):**
```java
List<String> MOCK_PATTERNS = Arrays.asList("mock", "spy", "when", "verify");
List<String> ASSERTION_PATTERNS = Arrays.asList("assert", "verify", "assertEquals");
```

### Custom quality rules

Projects can extend the audit with domain-specific rules:
- Performance test naming patterns
- Database test cleanup verification
- API test status code checking
- Security test coverage requirements

## Quality metrics tracking

Track improvements over time:
```bash
# Generate quality report
python scripts/audit_tests.py --report=json > quality_report_$(date +%Y%m%d).json

# Track metrics:
# - Percentage of behavioral test names
# - Average mock-to-assertion ratio
# - Number of vanity tests eliminated
# - Test maintenance effort (time to update when requirements change)
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevent test debt**: Catch quality issues before they accumulate
2. **Improve debugging**: Better tests make failures easier to understand
3. **Reduce maintenance**: Behavioral tests are more resilient to refactoring
4. **Increase confidence**: Quality tests actually catch regressions
5. **Standardize practices**: Consistent quality across team members
