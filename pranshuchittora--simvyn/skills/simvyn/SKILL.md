# Simvyn

Use Simvyn to inspect or operate the user's mobile development environment. This is a CLI workflow skill; it does not register MCP tools or a native Pi extension.

Requires Node.js 22 (22.14.0+) or 24+ and an installed or built Simvyn CLI. macOS supports iOS and Android; Linux supports Android. iOS requires Xcode and simulator runtimes; Android requires adb and configured devices or emulators. See the platform reference for operation-specific requirements.

## Start with the installed CLI

Resolve paths relative to this skill directory, not the user's project directory. The supplied launcher prefers the CLI bundled beside the installed skill, then a built Simvyn checkout, then `simvyn` on `PATH`. It does not download packages, build the project, or start a server on its own.

```bash
node /absolute/path/to/skills/simvyn/scripts/simvyn.mjs --version
node /absolute/path/to/skills/simvyn/scripts/simvyn.mjs device list --json
```

In the references, `simvyn` means this resolved invocation, or the user's existing `simvyn` executable when appropriate. Read `--help` for the installed command if its version differs from these references. Running with no arguments starts the dashboard; use an explicit subcommand for headless work.

Choose the full device ID from discovery and retain it through the task. Device name and ID-prefix matching are inconsistent across commands. Rediscover after booting an Android AVD because `avd:<name>` changes to an `emulator-<port>` ID. Most operations require a booted device. A discovered physical device may still need to be unlocked or trusted.

## Choose the relevant reference

- [CLI commands](references/cli.md): argument order, supported options, output forms, and commands missing from brief help examples.
- [Platform support](references/platforms.md): read before physical-device operations, permissions, app data inspection, clipboard work, or selecting an iOS/Android equivalent.
- [Recipes](references/recipes.md): app repro sessions, screenshots, Android local development, GPS and push testing, accessibility checks, and multi-device collections.
- [Automation and troubleshooting](references/automation.md): read for scripts/CI, JSON parsing, long-running processes, failed commands, and collection result interpretation.

## Execute and verify within the task

Use the actions needed for the user's request. Inspect an existing collection with `collections show` before applying it: its name does not reveal whether it erases data, launches apps, or changes settings. Preserve any existing authorization; when a requested diagnosis does not include deleting/resetting data, propose the concrete reset before doing it.

Save screenshots, recordings, and downloaded files to explicit paths and inspect the artifacts needed to substantiate the result. A screenshot command returns a path; the agent must use its own image-viewing tool to inspect the image. Report the device, actions performed, artifact locations, and observed failures or unsupported operations. Do not infer success from a command being available or from a collection's zero exit status alone.
