# Beancount Agent Skills

Cross-compatible Claude Code and Codex skills that automate Beancount workflows for [Beancount.io](https://beancount.io/) users (see root `CLAUDE.md` for repo-wide rules).

A skill is a `SKILL.md` instruction package with optional references, evals, scripts, and agent metadata. The canonical implementations live here under `.claude/skills/`; the repository-root `.claude/skills` and `.agents/skills` symlinks expose the same tree to Claude Code and Codex respectively. Do not create platform-specific copies.

Most stateful `beancount-*` skills have `references/` and `evals/`; small skills such as `beancount-init` may be self-contained. Mutating ledger workflows share the applicable trust rails: propose-then-confirm before writes, categorization restricted to existing accounts, `bean-check` as the verification gate, and the `import-id` convention from `.claude/skills/beancount-import/references/dedup.md` for externally sourced entries. Read-only skills do not pretend to have a write/confirmation phase. Every `routine-*` skill reads `.claude/skills/routine-shared/contract.md` as its first step — the suite's shared preconditions, verify gates, ship protocol, and STOPs live there, not in the individual skills.

## Skills

| Skill                       | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `beancount-ask`             | Answer analytical questions about the ledger ("top expenses", "net worth", "what subscriptions crept up") with tested BQL recipes via `bean-query`. Strictly read-only; every figure comes from a query shown with the answer — never model arithmetic. Ambiguous questions get a clarifying question, not a silent interpretation.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `beancount-close`           | Month-end close ritual: enumerate active accounts, reconcile each (delegating to `beancount-reconcile`), verify period-end assertions, detect recurring-entry gaps (reported, never fabricated), sweep `!` flags, and land the period's P&L/BS report as a confirm-gated git commit whose body is the close report. Red `bean-check` blocks the commit. Triggers on "close the month".                                                                                                                                                |
| `beancount-import`          | Import a bank/card export file (CSV, OFX/QFX, QIF) as categorized, deduplicated ledger entries. Seven-stage pipeline (Discover → Normalize → Stage → Dedup → Suggest → Confirm → Write+Verify): categorizes from the ledger's own payee history (existing accounts only — never invents), stamps every entry with `import-id` metadata so re-imports are no-ops, confirm-gated, `bean-check`-verified. Triggers on "import this CSV" / "record my bank export".                                                                       |
| `beancount-importer-author` | Write or repair a beangulp (beancount v3) importer from a sample export file, driven by beangulp's golden-file test harness — draft → generate → eyeball → `test` until green; a red harness is never handed over. Graduation path from `beancount-import` (reads its config block as the spec); minimal-patch drift repair keeps old goldens green. Triggers on "write an importer for X" / "my importer broke".                                                                                                                     |
| `beancount-init`            | Scaffold a fresh `main.bean` + Fava + uv project from an empty directory. Triggers on `/beancount-init` or "set up a new beancount repo".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `beancount-migrate`         | Migrate full history from a finance-app export (Mint, Monarch, QuickBooks Online, or any category-tagged CSV) into a fresh ledger: confirm-gated account/category mapping, transfer-pair dedup, opening balances + endpoint `balance` assertions that tie to stated balances, and a migration report that reconciles row counts and balances against the source — deltas surfaced, never forced. Composes `beancount-init`; entries carry `import-id` so later imports dedup against migrated history.                                |
| `beancount-options`         | Turn human-language descriptions of options trades (CSP, covered call, vertical, condor, roll, assignment, exercise, expiration, …) into balanced beancount transactions. Uses per-contract cost basis, IRS-aligned assignment treatment, and runs `bean-check` to verify before reporting success.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `beancount-reconcile`       | Reconcile one account against a bank/broker statement (CSV or pasted PDF text). Diffs statement vs ledger into mismatch classes (missing, duplicate, amount-mismatch, date-drift), and — only after confirmation — appends the missing transactions plus a period-end `balance` assertion that ties the account out. Append-only (reports suspects/duplicates/mismatches for manual fixing); never writes a failing assertion; `bean-check`-gated. Triggers on "reconcile my checking account" / "does my ledger match my statement". |
| `mermaid`                   | Draw concise, syntax-verified Mermaid architecture diagrams for a repo component, document, system, or dependency flow. Verifies the diagram renders via `mermaid-cli` before answering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `ship`                      | `/ship` — bring local `main` up to date with `git pull --rebase`, commit pending work with a Conventional Commits message (session-aware when the agent made the changes), and push to `origin/main`. Resolves rebase conflicts itself; ends at the shipped HEAD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `pm`                        | `/pm` — arrange the public `.pm` adoption board: status, new workstream, inbox notes, promote, new milestone, add-task, done. The **only** writer to `.pm/` and the canonical home of the board conventions (mission pillars, hierarchy, sizing rule, standing closing tasks, templates).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `pm-brainstorm`             | `/pm-brainstorm <topic>` — think a topic through with the TPM adoption lens and propose milestones / inbox notes as text only; ends with the exact `/pm` invocations to materialize them. Writes nothing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `loop-worker`               | `/loop-worker <wN>` — autonomously drain one `.pm` workstream: pick the lowest pending milestone, implement every task end to end with the package checks green, `/pm done` each task, `/ship` the milestone, repeat until none remain or a milestone blocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `routine-logic-simplifier`  | `/routine-logic-simplifier [pkg]` — pick one convoluted unit (churn hotspots, deep nesting, boolean spaghetti), pin its behavior with tests, simplify in place with zero behavior change and no new abstractions, `/ship`. A bug found mid-simplify is a separate `routine-logic-bugfixer` finding, never folded into the refactor.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `routine-logic-bugfixer`    | `/routine-logic-bugfixer [pkg]` — model one tricky unit (state machines, date math, sign conventions, dedup windows) exhaustively, prove each bug with a failing test against documented intent, land the minimal root-cause fix + regression test, `/ship`. Ambiguous intent → report, never ship an opinion. Crashes found while modeling are in scope.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `routine-dup-unifier`       | `/routine-dup-unifier [pkg]` — find live duplicated implementations within one package, prove semantic equivalence by reading every copy, keep the best-tested survivor, repoint callers, delete the rest, `/ship`. Cross-package duplication is reported, never merged; skip if unification needs an abstraction worse than the duplication.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `routine-dead-code-removal` | `/routine-dead-code-removal [pkg]` — run the package's own detector (`yarn lint:deadcode` / `make deadcode` / `scripts/lint-deadcode.sh`), verify each hit against dynamic references (expo-router file routes, registries, string lookups), delete or `knip.jsonc`-ignore, `/ship` each removal. Detector hits are candidates, not proof.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `routine-useless-test-pruner` | `/routine-useless-test-pruner [pkg]` — find tests that cannot fail (no assertions, mock tautologies, mocked-away units), prove it mechanically by sabotaging the covered behavior and watching the test stay green, revert the sabotage, delete the test, `/ship`. `git diff` must show only test changes before staging.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `routine-shipped-feature-inliner` | `/routine-shipped-feature-inliner [pkg]` — find gates for fully shipped features, triage deliberate-vs-forgotten via `DO_NOT_DO.md` / ADRs / git history, inline the path the flag always takes, delete the flag, `/ship`. Hard lines: `config.features.agentChat` is untouchable; the backend `featureFlags` GraphQL field is a cross-package contract — reported, never inlined; never flips a value.                                                                                                                          |
| `routine-flaky-test-fixer`  | `/routine-flaky-test-fixer [pkg]` — mine `gh run list` history for same-commit red→green reruns, reproduce locally with 20–30 repeated runs, fix the real nondeterminism (timers, teardown, ordering, unawaited promises), verify with 20 consecutive greens, `/ship`. Never retry-wraps or bumps timeouts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Conventions

### Skill structure

Each skill lives at `.claude/skills/<name>/` with:

- `SKILL.md` — frontmatter (`name`, `description` for triggering) + body instructions. Keep under ~500 lines; spill into `references/` for deep nuance.
- `references/` — optional files loaded on demand when the body points to them.
- `evals/` — optional `evals.json` + fixtures for `skill-creator` iteration.
- `scripts/` / `agents/` — optional executable helpers or platform metadata when the skill needs them.

### Shared suite conventions — beancount-*

Shared contracts for the `beancount-*` suite (apply each one only to skills that use that behavior, and point to its canonical definition rather than restating it):

- **Ledger discovery**: `fd -e beancount -e bean .` (fallback `find`); the "main" file has `option`/`plugin`/`include` directives or the most `open`s. Confirm when ambiguous.
- **Config blocks**: persisted state lives in `;; <skill-name> config` comment blocks at the top of the main file. Shapes differ deliberately — `beancount-import`'s is **per-source** (stanza per export source; `sign: negative=outflow` is format-speak), `beancount-reconcile`'s is **per-account** (`sign: asset|liability` is account-type-speak; the two encodings describe the same convention). Blocks coexist; skills may read each other's (importer-author reads import's as its spec).
- **`import-id` metadata**: the dedup convention for every entry that originates from an external source — canonical grammar and hash normalization in `.claude/skills/beancount-import/references/dedup.md` (migrate's `mint:`/`monarch:`/`qbo:` prefixes and importer-author's generated importers follow it).
- **Categorization fallback**: suggestions come only from accounts already opened; no confident prior → `Expenses:Uncategorized`, visibly flagged. Never invent an account.
- **Balance-assertion date**: assert the day **after** the period end (beancount checks at start-of-date) — canonical explanation in `.claude/skills/beancount-reconcile/SKILL.md`.
- **Fuzzy-match tolerance**: ±3 days, symmetric (import's dedup, migrate's transfer pairing, reconcile's date-drift window).

### Shared suite conventions — routine-*

The `routine-*` skills are autonomous maintenance passes over this monorepo (discover → prove → fix → verify → ship). Their shared contract lives canonically at `.claude/skills/routine-shared/contract.md` (not a skill — no `SKILL.md`); every routine reads it first. The invariants it defines:

- **One finding per `/ship`, never batched**; the next finding waits for the shipped SHA.
- **Never ship red**: the owning package's checks (the same table as `loop-worker`'s step 3) are the only gate — `/ship` has none. A package with no covering automated check (backend-v2, agent-box, deploy) means STOP, not ship.
- **Proof over suspicion**: a detector hit or grep match is a candidate; each skill defines its proof (failing test, still-green sabotage, empty reference sweep).
- **Budget**: 3 shipped findings per invocation, then a summary of shipped / skipped / nothing-found.
- **Universal STOPs**: new dependencies, cross-package API-contract changes, `DO_NOT_DO.md` conflicts, unpinnable behavior changes, unexplained red checks.
- **Never touch**: lockfiles, codegen output, `.pm/` (routines never write the board), `.env*`, vendored fava, the `AGENTS.md`/skills symlinks.
- **Scope argument**: `/routine-* [package-or-path]`; empty means survey, pick one target, announce it. The contract's symptom→owner table keeps the nine skills' territories disjoint.

### Validation

For any skill that emits beancount, run `bean-check` on the resulting file before declaring success. The `beancount-options` skill bakes this into its workflow as a "Verify" phase.

Use the CLI environment for `bean-check`; CI installs it with `uv sync --all-groups` in `cli/`.

Before opening a skills PR, run the structural suite locally:

```zsh
# from repo root (needs cli deps for bean-check)
cd cli && uv sync --all-groups && cd ..
python3 skills/scripts/ci-check.py
```

This checks SKILL.md frontmatter, `evals.json` validity and fixture paths, Python syntax under skills, the skills-package links, and `bean-check` on every `*ledger.beancount` (with known failure-mode fixtures listed in the script). Run `python3 scripts/check-agent-guidance.py` from the repository root for every `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` pair.

### Iterating on a skill

Use the `skill-creator` skill (`/skill-creator`) for the build → eval → review loop. Outputs land in `tmp/<skill-name>-workspace/` (gitignored).

### Scratch space

`skills/tmp/` is gitignored. Drop ledgers, eval outputs, throwaway scripts there while iterating. Don't put scratch at the repo root or inside `.claude/`.

### Adding a new skill

1. Create `.claude/skills/<new-name>/SKILL.md` with `name` and `description` frontmatter.
2. Be explicit in `description` about both when to trigger AND when to skip — Claude tends to undertrigger, but false positives are equally bad.
3. Build a few realistic test prompts in `evals/evals.json`, run them with and without the skill (via `skill-creator` workflow), iterate.
4. Update this CLAUDE.md's Skills table.
