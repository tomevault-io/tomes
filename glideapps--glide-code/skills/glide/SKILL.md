# Glide App Building

**Start here when building a Glide app.** This skill covers the overall workflow, agent coordination, and technical details for browser automation.

## Build Workflow Summary

1. **Clarify use case** - Understand what the user wants
2. **Create app first** - Get browser auth done early (blank app)
3. **Get API key** - Go to Data Editor, retrieve token from Users table (before spawning data agents)
4. **Analyze file** (if provided) - Use `file-analysis` agent
5. **Create tables via API** - Use `data` agent (faster than UI, in parallel)
6. **Build screens** - Use `build` agent for Playwright automation (in parallel)
7. **Design review** - Apply `design` skill to evaluate and improve screens
8. **QA verification** - Use `qa` agent to verify features actually work
9. **Finalize** - Access settings, testing, publish

## Agents

| Agent | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `build` | Browser automation via Playwright | Creating apps, adding screens, configuring UI |
| `file-analysis` | Analyze spreadsheets/data files | User provides a file to build from |
| `data` | Glide API operations | Creating tables, importing data, bulk operations |
| `design-review` | Critique screens for design quality | After building screens, to improve component choices and layouts |
| `qa` | Verify features actually work | Before telling user the app is ready |
| `app-research` | Explore and document existing apps | Understanding an app's structure, answering questions about it |

## Parallel Builds (Multi-Browser) - Maximize Speed

The plugin supports 6 concurrent browser sessions. **Browser automation is slow, so parallelize aggressively.**

### Parallel Strategy for New Apps

**Phase 1: Setup (Sequential)**
1. User provides use case
2. Create blank app (browser 1)
3. **Go to Data Editor and retrieve API key immediately**
   - Click "Data" tab in Glide Builder
   - Open Users table (or any existing table)
   - Click "Show API"
   - Copy the secret token
   - Keep the token for API operations
4. **Do this BEFORE spawning data agents** - prevents multiple agents trying to get the key in parallel

**Phase 2: Data Creation (Highly Parallel)**
- Spawn N `data` agents in parallel to create all tables (up to 6 concurrent)
- Each agent creates and links one table to the app with real or sample data
- Example: "Create the Tasks table using browser 1, create the Projects table using browser 2, create the Users table using browser 3"
- **WAIT for all tables to exist** - screens cannot be built without their backing tables

**Phase 3: Screen Building (Highly Parallel)**
- Once all tables exist, spawn up to 6 `build` agents in parallel
- Each agent builds screens for one data table (collection + detail view)
- Can start immediately after Phase 2 completes
- Example: "Build screens for Tasks using browser 1, build screens for Projects using browser 2, build screens for Users using browser 3"
- Agents design collections, detail views, and forms independently

**Phase 4: Design Review (One Screen at a Time)**
- Review ONE screen at a time, not the whole app (much more efficient)
- Reuse the same browser from build agents (alternate between building and reviewing)
- As each build agent finishes a screen, spawn design-review for that screen only
- Example workflow:
  1. Builder finishes Tasks screen on browser 1
  2. Design-review agent reviews Tasks using browser 1 (while other builders continue on browsers 2-6)
  3. Get feedback, pass to builder
  4. Builder implements feedback on Tasks (browser 1)
  5. Meanwhile, another builder finishes Projects on browser 2
  6. Design-review reviews Projects on browser 2
- Keep design review focused on one screen at a time for speed

**Phase 5: Implement Feedback (Parallel)**
- Spawn `build` agents to apply design improvements (up to 6)
- Different agents apply feedback to different screens simultaneously
- Example: "Implement design feedback for Tasks using browser 1, implement feedback for Projects using browser 2"

**Phase 6: QA (Parallel)**
- Run `qa` agents on different features in parallel (up to 6)
- Test each screen/feature independently
- Example: "Test Tasks creation using browser 5, test Projects editing using browser 6"

### How to Spawn Parallel Agents

**CRITICAL: Each parallel agent must use a different browser number.**

```
"Create the Tasks table using browser 1"
"Create the Projects table using browser 2"
"Create the Users table using browser 3"
```

**Browser assignment rules:**
- Use browsers 1-6 only
- Each agent gets a unique browser number (no sharing)
- Example: If spawning 3 data agents, assign browsers 1, 2, 3
- Example: If spawning 5 build agents, assign browsers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- You cannot have two agents both using browser 2

Each agent will:
- Use ONLY its assigned browser instance (`mcp__plugin_glide_browser-N__browser_*` tools)
- Work independently without blocking others
- Complete when the task is done

### Key Rules for Parallelization

1. **Get API token early** - Create one table in the first browser, grab the token from Data Editor
2. **Each agent needs the app ID** - Pass `appId` to all parallel agents
3. **Tables must exist before screens** - CRITICAL: All tables must be created (Phase 2) before any screens can be built (Phase 3). You can't design a screen without its backing data table.
4. **Data and tables come first** - Ensure real or sample data is imported into each table before building screens for it
5. **Use all 6 browsers** - Don't leave idle browsers when you could be building
6. **Phase dependencies**:
   - Phase 1 (Setup) → Phase 2 (Data) → Phase 3 (Screens) are sequential
   - Phases 4, 5, 6 (Design, Feedback, QA) can overlap and parallelize
7. **Design review one screen at a time** - Review individual screens, not the whole app. Alternate with building on the same browser.
8. **Design review doesn't block** - Review can happen while other builders continue on different browsers
9. **QA is the final stage** - Run QA on all screens in parallel to validate before finishing

**Skills:**
| Skill | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `design` | Screen design principles, techniques, and component guidance | Evaluating collection styles, improving layouts, choosing components |

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Clarify Use Case

**Before doing anything, understand what the user wants.**

- If clear: Confirm back ("I'll build a task management app for your team")
- If unclear: Ask what the app should do, who will use it

### 2. Create App First

**Create the app immediately**, before file analysis.

Why:
- Gets browser auth out of the way early
- User sees progress right away

Use `build` agent: go.glideapps.com → "New app" → **"Blank"** → "Create app"

**NEVER use "Import a file"** - always Blank. Data comes via API.

### 3. Get API Key (Before Spawning Data Agents)

**Immediately after creating the app, retrieve the API key.**

This prevents multiple data agents from trying to fetch it in parallel later.

Steps (using `build` agent):
1. Click the "Data" tab
2. Open the "Users" table (or any existing table)
3. Click "Show API" button
4. Copy the secret token
5. Keep the token in memory
6. Pass this to all `data` agents when delegating

**Why**: Data agents need the API key to create tables. Getting it early and once prevents race conditions.

### 4. Analyze File (If User Has One)

Use `file-analysis` agent with:
- The file path
- Context hints (app purpose, key features, who will use it)

Returns: tables to import, relationships, formulas to rebuild

### 5. Create Tables via API

Use `data` agent - much faster than UI for bulk data.

**Critical**: Always create NEW tables. Never inject into existing ones.

**Always include images**: Use `https://picsum.photos/seed/{id}/400/300` placeholders.

### 6. Build Screens

Use `build` agent to:
1. Set branding (name, icon, colors) - see naming rules below
2. Link tables created via API
3. Add computed columns (relations, rollups, AI)
4. Create screens from data
5. Configure collections and detail views

**App naming rules:**
- **Short**: 2 words maximum
- **No company name**: The app lives in the company's team already
- **No punctuation**: No periods, exclamation marks, etc.
- Good: "Employees", "Task Tracker", "Inventory"
- Bad: "Tesla Employee Directory", "Acme Inc. Tasks."

### 7. Design Review (One Screen at a Time)

**Review screens individually, not the whole app** - much more efficient.

As each `build` agent finishes a screen:
1. Spawn a `design-review` agent for that ONE screen
2. Reuse the same browser that just finished building (save a browser)
3. Get feedback on: mobile/desktop layouts, collection styles, component choices, data density
4. Pass feedback back to builder

Pattern: Builder finishes screen → Review it → Get feedback → Builder implements → Repeat for next screen

**Don't review the entire app at once** - that's slow. Review and improve one screen, then move to the next.

### 8. QA Verification (Critical!)

**Don't tell the user the app is ready until you verify features actually work.**

Use `qa` agent to:
- Verify screens exist and have components (not empty)
- Verify data binding works (real data shows, not placeholders)
- Test forms actually save data (check Data Editor)
- Test buttons/actions actually work
- Verify computed columns have formulas configured
- Check that workflows are set up correctly

The QA agent will produce a report of PASS/FAIL for each feature. Fix any failures before declaring the app complete.

### 9. Finalize

Configure access/privacy, test as different users, publish.

## Key Patterns

**Screen = Table + Collection + Detail**
- Backing table provides data
- Collection shows list/cards
- Detail shows one item

**Calculations are Columns**
- Math for arithmetic
- If-Then-Else for conditions
- Rollups for aggregations
- Lookups for related data

## What NOT to Do

- Don't use "Import a file" - always Blank
- Don't use the Agent tab in Glide Builder
- Don't use Glide's file upload UI - use API
- **Don't inject into existing tables** - always create NEW tables
- **NEVER import into the Users table** - it's reserved for user profiles only
- Don't click inline "Import" links next to tables - use "+" menu instead
- Don't skip images

# Builder Reference

## URLs

| URL | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `go.glideapps.com` | Dashboard - view/manage apps |
| `go.glideapps.com/app/{appId}/layout` | Layout Editor |
| `go.glideapps.com/app/{appId}/data` | Data Editor |
| `go.glideapps.com/app/{appId}/settings` | App Settings |

## Main Navigation Tabs

1. **Data** - Data Editor for tables and columns
2. **Layout** - Screen and component design
3. **Workflows** - Automation sequences
4. **Settings** - App configuration

**Warning**: There is also an "Agent" tab in the builder. **Do not use it.** Build manually using Data and Layout tabs instead.

## Creating a New App

1. Navigate to `go.glideapps.com`
2. Click "New app" card
3. Select **Blank** (recommended - use API for data import)
4. Click "Create app"

## Data Editor

### Adding Columns (Browser Automation Required)

**All column creation must be done via browser automation** - the Glide API does not support adding columns to existing tables.

**Recommended method** - Keyboard shortcut (fastest):
1. Navigate to Data tab
2. Click on the target table
3. Press **CMD+SHIFT+ENTER** (macOS) or **CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER** (Windows)
4. Type the column **Name**
5. **Explicitly select the Type** from dropdown (required - commits the name)
6. Configure options and click **Save**

**Alternative method** - UI clicks:
1. Click on any column header → "Add column right"
2. Type the column **Name**
3. **Always explicitly select the Type** from dropdown (even for Text)
4. Configure options and click **Save**

**Important**:
- Interacting with the type picker commits the column name. If you skip this step, the name may not save.
- The keyboard shortcut method is significantly faster and more reliable for automation.

### Column Type Categories
- **Basic** - Text, Number, Boolean, Image, Date & Time
- **Computed** - Math, Template, If-Then-Else, Relations
- **AI** - Audio to Text, Generate Text, Text to JSON
- **Integrations** - Call API, Claude, OpenAI, Google Maps

The dropdown is searchable - type to filter.

## Layout Editor

### Adding Screens/Tabs
1. Click "+" in Navigation or Menu section
2. Choose: **Screen from data**, **Custom screen**, or **Form screen**
3. Configure in right panel
4. **Set a short label** - 1-2 words maximum (e.g., "Tasks", "My Team")
5. **Pick an appropriate icon** - click the icon and choose one that matches the content

**Tab labels**: Keep them short! 1-2 words max.
- Good: "Tasks", "Team", "Settings", "Orders"
- Bad: "My Task List", "Team Member Directory"

**Tab icons**: Don't leave random icons. Choose icons that represent the screen's purpose:
- Tasks/Todos: checkmark, clipboard, list
- People/Users: person, people, user
- Settings: gear, cog, sliders
- Home/Dashboard: home, grid, chart
- Messages: chat, envelope, bell
- Calendar/Events: calendar, clock
- Files/Documents: folder, document, file
- Search: magnifying glass
- Add/Create: plus, add

### Adding Components
1. Select a screen
2. Click "+" in Components section
3. Search or browse categories
4. Click to add, configure in right panel

### Collection Styles
Card, List, Table, Data Grid, Checklist, Calendar, Kanban, Custom

## Settings

**Name & Icon** - App name (keep short, 2 words max, no company name), icon, logo
**Appearance** - Accent color, layout (Left/Top), style (Light/Deep/Accent)
**Access** - Who can access the app
**Integrations** - External connections

### Changing App Icon (Emoji Picker)

To change the app icon using the emoji picker:

1. Go to **Settings** tab → **Name & Icon** section
2. **Click the icon image** (not the Upload button) → Opens "Emoji Mart™" picker
3. **Type the emoji name in the search box** (e.g., "rocket", "checkmark", "clipboard")
4. **Click the emoji button** from the search results

**Important**: Always use the search box! Browsing categories is slow and error-prone. The search instantly filters to matching emojis.

Common emoji searches for app icons:
- Tasks: "checkmark", "clipboard", "list"
- People: "person", "people", "user"
- Business: "briefcase", "chart", "money"
- Home: "home", "house"
- Settings: "gear", "wrench"
- Calendar: "calendar", "clock"
- Messages: "chat", "envelope", "bell"
- Food: "pizza", "coffee", "burger"
- Travel: "car", "plane", "rocket"

## Browser Automation Tips

**Column names may not save**: Always select the column type explicitly.

**Avoid info icons (ⓘ)**: They trigger tooltips that can block the UI.

### Hide Tooltips

Rich tooltips with class `rich-tooltip-*` can block clicks and interfere with automation. Run this via `browser_evaluate` to hide them:

```javascript
() => {
  document.querySelectorAll('[class*="rich-tooltip"]').forEach(el => el.remove());
  return { removed: true };
}
```

Run this periodically if tooltips keep appearing, or after hovering over info icons accidentally.

**Keyboard shortcuts:**
- `Cmd+K` - Open search
- `Escape` - Close dialogs and panels
- `CMD+SHIFT+ENTER` - Add new column (when in Data Editor with table selected)
- `CMD+Z` (macOS) / `CTRL+Z` (Windows) - Undo last action

**Undo mistakes:**
Glide Builder supports standard undo functionality. If you accidentally delete a component, action, or make an unwanted change, immediately use `CMD+Z` (macOS) or `CTRL+Z` (Windows) to revert it.

**Common scenarios:**
- Deleted the wrong action → CMD+Z to restore it
- Removed a component by mistake → CMD+Z to bring it back
- Changed a setting incorrectly → CMD+Z to revert

**Important**: Undo only works for recent actions in the current session. If you navigate away or refresh, you may not be able to undo.

**If stuck:**
1. Press Escape to clear overlays
2. Click a main navigation tab to reset
3. Take a screenshot to see current state
4. If completely stuck, refresh the page
