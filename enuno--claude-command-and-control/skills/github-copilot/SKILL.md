## Custom Instructions

GitHub Copilot supports three types of custom instructions to guide AI behavior for your repository.

### Instruction Types Overview

| Type | Location | Scope | Use Case |
|------|----------|-------|----------|
| Repository-wide | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | All files | General coding standards |
| Path-specific | `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` | Matched files | Language/framework rules |
| Agent-specific | `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md` | Model-specific | AI model customization |

### Repository-Wide Instructions

Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with natural language instructions:

```markdown
# Copilot Instructions for This Repository

## High-Level Details
- This is a TypeScript monorepo with React frontend and Node.js backend
- Uses pnpm for package management
- Follows clean architecture patterns

## Build Instructions
- Bootstrap: pnpm install
- Build: pnpm build
- Test: pnpm test
- Lint: pnpm lint

## Project Layout
- /apps/web - React frontend (Next.js 14)
- /apps/api - Express.js backend
- /packages/shared - Shared utilities
- /.github/workflows - CI/CD pipelines

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components in React
- Use async/await over .then() chains

## Validation Steps
- Run pnpm typecheck before committing
- Ensure all tests pass with pnpm test
- Verify no lint errors with pnpm lint
```

**Content Recommendations** (from official docs):
- **High-level details**: Repository summary, size, languages, frameworks
- **Build instructions**: Bootstrap, build, test, run, lint sequences with versions
- **Project layout**: Architectural elements, configuration files, CI/CD workflows
- **Validation steps**: Explicit procedures to verify changes

**Guidelines**:
- Keep instructions under 2 pages (not task-specific)
- Whitespace between instructions is ignored
- Can be single paragraph or separated by blank lines for legibility

### Automatic Instructions Generation

On GitHub.com, Copilot coding agent can generate `.github/copilot-instructions.md` automatically:

1. Open any pull request in your repository
2. Look for the Copilot suggestion in PR comments
3. Click the link to generate instructions
4. Or navigate to repository **Settings** → **Copilot** → **Agents** tab

### Path-Specific Instructions

Create files in `.github/instructions/` with frontmatter specifying glob patterns.

**File naming**: `NAME.instructions.md`

**Single pattern:**
```markdown
---
applyTo: "**/*.ts"
---

# TypeScript Guidelines

- Use strict null checks
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use enums for fixed sets of values
- Document public APIs with JSDoc
```

**Multiple patterns** (comma-separated):
```markdown
---
applyTo: "**/*.ts,**/*.tsx"
---

# TypeScript and React Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer named exports over default
- Use React.FC for component typing
```

**With agent exclusion:**
```markdown
---
applyTo: "src/api/**/*"
excludeAgent: "code-review"
---

# API Development Guidelines

These instructions apply to coding agent only, not code review.

- Use OpenAPI/Swagger annotations
- Return consistent error responses
- Include rate limiting headers
- Log all requests with correlation IDs
```

### Glob Pattern Reference

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `*` | All files in current directory |
| `**` or `**/*` | All files recursively |
| `*.py` | Python files in current directory |
| `**/*.ts` | All TypeScript files recursively |
| `**/*.ts,**/*.tsx` | TypeScript and TSX files |
| `src/**/*.py` | Python files in src recursively |
| `src/api/**/*` | All files in src/api recursively |
| `**/subdir/**/*.py` | Python files in any subdir at any depth |
| `app/models/**/*.rb` | Ruby files in app/models |

### Agent Exclusion

Use `excludeAgent` in frontmatter to restrict which Copilot features use the instructions:

```yaml
---
applyTo: "**"
excludeAgent: "code-review"
---
```

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `code-review` | Only coding agent uses these instructions |
| `coding-agent` | Only code review uses these instructions |
| (omitted) | Both coding agent and code review use instructions |

### Agent-Specific Instructions

Create model-specific instruction files in repository root:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `AGENTS.md` | General agent instructions (all models) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude-specific instructions |
| `GEMINI.md` | Gemini-specific instructions |

**Note**: In VS Code, agent instructions outside workspace root are disabled by default.

### Instruction Priority

Instructions combine automatically with this priority (highest to lowest):

1. **Personal instructions** - User's global settings
2. **Repository instructions** - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
3. **Path-specific instructions** - Matching `.instructions.md` files
4. **Organization instructions** - Org-wide policies

When instructions conflict, higher priority wins. All applicable non-conflicting instructions combine.

### Enabling Custom Instructions

**VS Code:**
1. Open Settings (`Cmd+,` / `Ctrl+,`)
2. Search for "Code Generation: Use Instruction Files"
3. Enable the toggle

**GitHub.com (Code Review):**
1. Navigate to repository **Settings**
2. Click **Copilot** in sidebar
3. Select **Code review** tab
4. Toggle "Use custom instructions when reviewing pull requests"

### Limitations

- Path-specific instructions on GitHub.com currently support only:
  - Copilot coding agent
  - Code review
- Instructions should not conflict (behavior undefined for conflicts)
- Agent instructions outside workspace root disabled by default in VS Code

## Pull Request Features

### PR Summaries

```

## Privacy & Policy Settings

### Public Code Matching

Control whether Copilot suggests code matching public repositories:

- Checks ~150 characters of surrounding context
- Matching or near-matching suggestions won't display when blocked
- Configure in personal settings or organization policies

**Note**: Enterprise Cloud members cannot independently configure this - inherits from organization.

### Data Collection

Choose whether GitHub collects prompts and suggestions:

- **Default**: Data NOT used for AI model training
- Optional: Allow collection for product improvement
- Configure in personal Copilot settings

### Alternative AI Models

Enable additional AI model options:

| Model | Default | Configurable |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| GPT-4 | ✅ Enabled | N/A |
| Claude | ❌ Disabled | ✅ Yes |
| Gemini | ❌ Disabled | ✅ Yes |

### Web Search (Bing)

Copilot Chat can use Bing for current events:

- **Default**: Disabled
- Enable for specialized topics or recent information
- Toggle in personal settings

## MCP Integration

### What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI models with external tools and data sources.

### GitHub MCP Server

Install and configure the GitHub MCP server:

```json
// VS Code settings.json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.mcp.servers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@anthropic/github-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "${env:GITHUB_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Toolsets

| Toolset | Capabilities |
|---------|--------------|
| `repos` | Repository operations |
| `issues` | Issue management |
| `pulls` | Pull request operations |
| `code_security` | Security scanning |
| `experiments` | Experimental features |

### Using MCP Tools in Chat

```
User: @github Create an issue for the login bug

Copilot: [Uses MCP to create issue]
Issue #123 created: "Fix login redirect loop"
```

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### Selecting the Right Tool

**Inline Suggestions Excel At:**
- Real-time code completion while typing
- Generating boilerplate and repetitive patterns
- Converting natural language comments into code
- Test-driven development workflows

**Chat Interface Works Best For:**
- Answering conceptual questions about existing code
- Building large code blocks iteratively
- Using built-in keywords and skills for specific tasks
- Adopting specialized personas (e.g., code reviewer role)

### Effective Prompt Patterns

1. **Be Specific**
   ```
   ❌ Write a function
   ✅ Write a TypeScript function that validates email addresses using regex
   ```

2. **Provide Context**
   ```
   ❌ Fix this code
   ✅ Fix the null pointer error on line 45 when user.profile is undefined
   ```

3. **Include Examples**
   ```
   Write a function that formats dates
   Input: "2024-01-15"
   Output: "January 15, 2024"
   ```

4. **Break Down Complex Tasks**
   ```
   Instead of: "Build a user authentication system"

   Ask step by step:
   1. Create user model with email and password hash
   2. Add registration endpoint with validation
   3. Add login endpoint with JWT generation
   4. Add middleware for protected routes
   ```

5. **Specify Constraints**
   ```
   Write a sorting function that:
   - Handles null values gracefully
   - Works with arrays up to 10,000 items
   - Maintains stable sort order
   ```

### Role-Playing for Better Results

```
Act as a senior security engineer and review this authentication code
for vulnerabilities:

[paste code]

Focus on:
- Input validation
- Token handling
- Session management
- OWASP Top 10 risks
```

### Context Management

**Optimize Response Quality:**
- Keep only relevant files open in your IDE
- Remove unhelpful previous prompts from chat
- Reference specific repositories and files
- Use IDE keywords to focus on particular tasks
- Start new conversations when context becomes cluttered

**Iterative Refinement:**
- Rephrase prompts if initial responses aren't helpful
- Review multiple inline suggestions using keyboard shortcuts
- Provide feedback (thumbs up/down) to improve suggestions

### What Copilot Does Well

- ✅ Writing tests and repetitive code
- ✅ Debugging and correcting syntax
- ✅ Explaining and commenting code
- ✅ Generating regular expressions
- ✅ Converting comments to code
- ✅ Refactoring and simplifying

### What to Validate Carefully

- ⚠️ Business logic accuracy
- ⚠️ Security-sensitive code
- ⚠️ Performance-critical sections
- ⚠️ External API integrations
- ⚠️ Database queries

### Code Validation Checklist

Before accepting suggestions:
1. Request explanations of suggested code
2. Evaluate functionality correctness
3. Check for security vulnerabilities
4. Assess readability and maintainability
5. Run linting and code scanning
6. Verify against project conventions

## Enterprise Metrics & ROI Measurement

### Engineering System Success Playbook (ESSP) Framework

GitHub's ESSP provides a structured approach to measuring Copilot's impact on engineering teams using the SPACE framework:

| SPACE Dimension | Copilot Metrics |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Satisfaction** | Copilot satisfaction score (1-5 survey), tooling satisfaction |
| **Performance** | Code quality, security maintainability scores |
| **Activity** | PRs merged per developer, suggestion acceptance rates |
| **Communication** | PR review turnaround, collaboration patterns |
| **Efficiency** | Lead time reduction, AI leverage percentage |

### Copilot Satisfaction Metric

Measure developer satisfaction with Copilot through periodic surveys:

**Survey Question**: "How satisfied are you with GitHub Copilot?"

| Score | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| 5 | Extremely satisfied - Core part of workflow |
| 4 | Satisfied - Regular productive use |
| 3 | Neutral - Occasional use |
| 2 | Dissatisfied - Limited value |
| 1 | Very dissatisfied - Not using |

**Measurement Guidelines**:
- Survey quarterly for trend analysis
- Segment by team, role, and language
- Track alongside adoption metrics
- Include qualitative feedback questions

### AI Leverage Calculation

Calculate the ROI of Copilot investment:

```
AI Leverage = (Time Savings × Staff Salary) / AI Costs × 100
```

**Example Calculation**:
```
Time saved per developer: 10 hours/week
Team size: 50 developers
Average hourly rate: $75
Copilot cost per seat: $19/month

Weekly savings: 10 × 50 × $75 = $37,500
Monthly savings: $37,500 × 4 = $150,000
Monthly cost: 50 × $19 = $950

AI Leverage = ($150,000 / $950) × 100 = 15,789%
```

**Data Collection**:
- Time saved: Developer surveys or time tracking
- Acceptance rates: GitHub analytics dashboard
- Cost: License and infrastructure costs
- Productivity gains: PRs merged, cycle time improvements

### Four Engineering Success Zones

Track Copilot's impact across these key areas:

3. Custom instructions for codebase context
4. Training and enablement programs
5. Regular metrics review and iteration

## Addressing Engineering Antipatterns

Copilot helps teams overcome common engineering antipatterns:

### Big Bang Releases

**Problem**: Large, infrequent releases increase risk and complexity.

**Copilot Solutions**:
- Generate feature flags for incremental rollout
- Automate test creation for smaller PRs
- Suggest refactoring to isolate features

```
User: Help me add a feature flag for the new checkout flow

Copilot: [Generates feature flag implementation with gradual rollout support]
```

### Gold Plating

**Problem**: Adding unnecessary features beyond requirements.

**Copilot Solutions**:
- Focus code review on scope adherence
- Generate tests that match acceptance criteria only
- Suggest simpler implementations

```
User: Review this PR for scope creep. Requirements: [paste requirements]

Copilot: [Identifies code that goes beyond stated requirements]
```

### Overengineering

**Problem**: Overly complex solutions for simple problems.

**Copilot Solutions**:
- Use `/simplify` command on complex code
- Request alternative simpler approaches
- Generate YAGNI-focused implementations

```
User: /simplify This seems overengineered for just caching API responses

Copilot: [Suggests simpler caching approach without unnecessary abstractions]
```

### Technical Debt Accumulation

**Problem**: Shortcuts that degrade maintainability over time.

**Copilot Solutions**:
- Identify tech debt during code review
- Suggest refactoring opportunities
- Generate documentation for legacy code

```
User: Analyze this file for technical debt and suggest improvements

Copilot: [Lists debt items with prioritized refactoring suggestions]
```

### Inadequate Testing

**Problem**: Insufficient test coverage leading to fragile code.

**Copilot Solutions**:
- Auto-generate unit tests with `/tests`
- Suggest edge cases and error scenarios
- Create integration and E2E tests

```
User: /tests Generate comprehensive tests for UserService including edge cases

Copilot: [Creates tests covering happy path, errors, edge cases, and boundary conditions]
```

### Deployment Bottlenecks

**Problem**: Manual or slow deployment processes.

**Copilot Solutions**:
- Generate GitHub Actions workflows
- Automate CI/CD pipeline creation
- Create deployment scripts and documentation

```
User: Create a GitHub Actions workflow for deploying to AWS ECS with staging and production environments

Copilot: [Generates complete CI/CD workflow with environment promotion]
```

### GitHub's Internal Copilot Usage

GitHub reports these internal use cases for Copilot:

| Use Case | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| **Test creation** | Faster test writing, better coverage |
| **Code refactoring** | Cleaner, more maintainable code |
| **GitHub Actions workflows** | Automated CI/CD setup |
