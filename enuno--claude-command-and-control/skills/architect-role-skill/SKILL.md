## Component Interactions

### Client → API Gateway
- Protocol: HTTPS/REST
- Authentication: JWT tokens
- Rate Limiting: 100 req/min per user

### API Gateway → Services
- Protocol: gRPC / REST
- Service Discovery: [Method]
- Load Balancing: [Strategy]

## Data Flow Patterns

### Write Path
1. Client sends request to API Gateway
2. Gateway validates JWT token
3. Request routed to appropriate service
4. Service validates business rules
5. Service writes to database
6. Async notification sent if needed
7. Response returned to client

### Read Path
1. Client requests data
2. Check cache (Redis)
3. If miss, query database
4. Transform and return data
5. Update cache for future requests

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless services behind load balancer
- Database read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Cache layer (Redis/Memcached) to reduce DB load

### Vertical Scaling
- Database can scale up to handle write load
- Background workers for async processing

### Bottlenecks
- Primary database writes (mitigated by caching)
- Third-party API rate limits (mitigated by queuing)

## Failure Modes and Resilience

### Database Failure
- Impact: Service degradation
- Mitigation: Read replicas, automatic failover
- Recovery Time: < 5 minutes

### Service Failure
- Impact: Partial functionality loss
- Mitigation: Circuit breakers, graceful degradation
- Recovery Time: Automatic restart

### Third-Party API Failure
- Impact: Feature unavailable
- Mitigation: Queue requests, retry with backoff
- Recovery Time: When API recovers
```

**4. TECH_STACK.md**

```markdown

```

**5. SECURITY.md**

```markdown
# Security Architecture: [Project Name]

## Authentication Strategy

### Method: JWT Tokens
- Access token lifetime: 15 minutes
- Refresh token lifetime: 7 days
- Tokens signed with RS256 (asymmetric)

### Implementation
1. User authenticates with credentials
2. Server issues access + refresh token
3. Client stores tokens securely (httpOnly cookies)
4. Access token used for API requests
5. Refresh token used to obtain new access token

## Authorization Model

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**Roles**:
- Admin: Full system access
- Manager: Department-level access
- User: Personal data access only
- Guest: Read-only public data

**Permission Checking**:
- Middleware validates JWT and extracts role
- Route handlers check required permissions
- Database queries filtered by user context

## Data Encryption

### At Rest
- Database: AWS RDS encryption with KMS
- Backups: S3 server-side encryption
- PII fields: Application-level encryption (AES-256)

### In Transit
- All API traffic over HTTPS (TLS 1.3)
- Internal services use mutual TLS
- Database connections encrypted

## Secrets Management
- Environment variables for non-sensitive config
- AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive credentials
- Rotation policy: Every 90 days
- Access audited and logged

## Compliance Requirements

### GDPR
- User data export capability
- Right to deletion implementation
- Consent tracking
- Data processing agreements with third parties

### Security Testing Plan
- Automated SAST scans on every PR
- Dependency vulnerability scanning (Dependabot)
- Penetration testing: Quarterly
- Security audit: Annually
```

**Step 2.1: Discovery Phase**

```bash
# Examine project structure
find . -type f \( -name "*.js" -o -name "*.py" -o -name "*.java" \) | head -50

# Review dependencies
cat package.json 2>/dev/null || cat requirements.txt 2>/dev/null || cat pom.xml 2>/dev/null

# Analyze git activity
git log --oneline --since="6 months ago" --pretty=format:"%h %s" | head -20

# Identify most changed files (potential hotspots)
git log --since="6 months ago" --name-only --pretty=format: | sort | uniq -c | sort -rg | head -20
```

**Step 2.2: Analysis Framework**

Evaluate each dimension and rate 1-5 (5=excellent):

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Code Organization | | Modularity, separation of concerns |
| Documentation | | README, API docs, inline comments |
| Testing | | Coverage, test quality, CI integration |
| Security | | Auth, data protection, vulnerability scan |
| Performance | | Response times, resource usage, optimization |
| Scalability | | Horizontal/vertical scaling capability |
| Maintainability | | Code complexity, technical debt |
| Modern Practices | | Version control, CI/CD, code review |

**Step 2.3: Recommendation Report**
