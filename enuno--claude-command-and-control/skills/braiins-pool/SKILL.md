## Quick Reference

### Pool Information
- **Founded**: 2010 (first block mined)
- **Former Names**: bitcoin.cz, Slush Pool
- **Reward Model**: FPPS (Full Pay Per Share)
- **Pool Fee**: 2.5% (0% when using Braiins OS firmware)
- **Payout Schedule**: Daily at 9:00 UTC
- **Current Block Reward**: 3.125 BTC (post-2024 halving)

### Connection Details
**Pool URL**: `stratum+tcp://stratum.braiins.com:3333`
**User ID Format**: `userName.workerName`
**Stratum V2**: Default port 3336 (automatic location-based routing)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Configuration needed:
# 1. Pool URL: stratum+tcp://stratum.braiins.com:3333
# 2. User ID: yourUsername.workerName
# 3. Password: anything (not used)

# For Stratum V2:
# Pool URL includes public key for authentication
# Requires Braiins OS firmware
```

### Solo Mining
```bash
# Solo Mining URLs:
stratum+tcp://solo.stratum.braiins.com:3333
stratum+tcp://solo.stratum.braiins.com:443
stratum+tcp://solo.stratum.braiins.com:25

# Username: <bitcoin_address>.<optional_workername>
# Fee: 0.5% (credited to CKPool authors)
# Check stats: https://solo.braiins.com/stats/<bitcoin_address>
```

### FPPS Reward Formula
```
Coinbase Reward Cut (CRC) = (S × C) / (D × 2^32)
Transaction Fee Cut (TFC) = (AF × S) / (D × 2^32)
Total Reward (TR) = CRC + TFC - Pool Fee

Where:
  S = Shares submitted
  C = Coinbase block reward (3.125 BTC)
  D = Network difficulty
  AF = Average mining fee
```
