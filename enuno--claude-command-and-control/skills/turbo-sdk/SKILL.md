# turbo-sdk

Complete Arweave Turbo ecosystem skill covering client SDKs, core upload infrastructure, backend payment services, and CLI tooling for permanent decentralized storage.

## Description

This skill provides end-to-end coverage of the Turbo Upload Service ecosystem for permanent decentralized storage on Arweave:

### turbo-sdk (Client SDK)
The first SDK on Arweave to bring you programmable fiat top ups, Turbo-powered upload reliability, and fast data and indexing finality for TypeScript based Web and Node projects.

**License:** Apache License 2.0
**Status:** Production-ready with 144 releases
**Purpose:** Client-side upload and payment integration

### turbo-upload-service (Core Infrastructure)
Production-grade data bundling service that packages ANS-104 "data items" and delivers them to Arweave. Two-component architecture (Upload Service + Fulfillment Service) designed for AWS at-scale deployment with Docker support.
