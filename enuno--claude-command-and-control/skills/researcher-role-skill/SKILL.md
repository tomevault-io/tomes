## Examples

### Example 1: Technology Comparison

**Task**: Evaluate state management libraries for React application

```markdown
## Options Evaluated
- Redux Toolkit (Score: 8.2/10)
- Zustand (Score: 8.5/10)
- Jotai (Score: 7.8/10)

## Recommendation
**Selected**: Zustand

**Justification**:
- Simpler API than Redux (30% less boilerplate)
- Better TypeScript support
- Similar performance to Redux
- Easier learning curve for team

**Result**: Decision made within 2 days of research
```

### Example 2: Feature Feasibility

**Task**: Research real-time collaboration feature

```markdown
## Feature Analysis
- Complexity: High (WebSocket implementation required)
- Dependencies: Socket.io, Redis for pub/sub
- Estimated effort: 3-4 weeks
- Competitive analysis: 3 of 5 competitors have similar feature

## Recommendation
**Recommendation**: Implement (Phase 2)

**Priority**: Medium

**Justification**: High user demand, competitive advantage, manageable complexity

**Result**: Greenlit for implementation in Q2
```

### Example 3: Problem Investigation

**Task**: Investigate intermittent database connection failures

```markdown
## Root Cause
Connection pool exhaustion due to missing `finally` blocks in async operations

## Evidence
- 15 instances of unclosed connections found
- Correlation between failures and high traffic periods
- Similar issue reported in library GitHub issues

## Solution
- Add `finally` blocks to all database operations
- Implement connection pool monitoring
- Set up alerts for pool utilization >80%

**Result**: Issue resolved, no recurrence in 30 days
```
