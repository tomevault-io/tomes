# Cloud Infrastructure

Design and provision cloud infrastructure with AWS-primary patterns and cloud-agnostic naming for portability.

## Decision Framework

```
New service/workload?
├── Stateless, event-driven, <15min → Serverless (Lambda + API GW)
├── Long-running, stateful, predictable → Containers (ECS Fargate)
├── Kubernetes-native, multi-cloud → Orchestration (EKS)
└── Static content, CDN → Storage (S3 + CloudFront)

Database needs?
├── Key-value, <1ms, scale-to-zero → DynamoDB
├── Relational, complex queries → RDS/Aurora
├── Document store, flexible schema → DocumentDB
└── Cache, sessions, pub/sub → ElastiCache (Redis)

IaC approach?
├── AWS-only, type-safe → CDK (TypeScript)
├── Multi-cloud, declarative → Terraform
└── Simple, YAML → CloudFormation
```

## When NOT to Use

- **CI/CD pipelines**: Use `ci-cd` skill for pipeline config (CodePipeline, GitHub Actions)
- **Database schema design**: Use `database-design` skill for schema/migrations/queries
- **Application-level monitoring**: Use `observability` skill for application metrics/logs/traces
