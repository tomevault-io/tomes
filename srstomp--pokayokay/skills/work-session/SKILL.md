# Work Session

Orchestrate AI-assisted development with configurable human control, using ohno for task management via MCP.

## When NOT to Use

- **Planning work** — Use `planning` to create epics/stories/tasks before starting sessions
- **Quick one-off tasks** — Use `/quick` for simple tasks that don't need the full subagent pipeline
- **Revising a plan** — Use `plan-revision` to modify scope, dependencies, or task hierarchy
- **Running a spike** — Use `spike` for time-boxed investigation before committing to implementation

## Key Principles

- Fresh context per task via subagent dispatch (no context degradation)
- Configurable checkpoint control: supervised, semi-auto, auto, or unattended
- Smart worktree isolation by task type (feature/bug → worktree, chore/docs → in-place)
- Hooks handle lifecycle automatically (sync, commit, tests)
- ohno MCP provides session continuity across conversations

## Quick Start Checklist

1. Initialize ohno: `npx @stevestomp/ohno-cli init`
2. Get session context: MCP `get_session_context()`
3. Get next task: MCP `get_next_task()`
4. Dispatch subagent for implementation
5. Review results at checkpoints (based on mode)

## Operating Modes

| Mode | Task Complete | Story Complete | Epic Complete |
|------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| supervised | PAUSE | PAUSE | PAUSE |
| semi-auto | log | PAUSE | PAUSE |
| auto | skip | log | PAUSE |
| unattended | skip | skip | skip |
