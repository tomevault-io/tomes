# SDK Development

Create professional TypeScript SDKs from scratch or by extraction.

## Key Principles

- **Clean public API** — Export only what consumers need, hide internals
- **Type everything** — Full type coverage for config, methods, responses, and errors
- **Meaningful errors** — Typed error classes with codes and context
- **Sensible defaults** — Works out of the box with minimal config
- **Framework agnostic** — Core SDK has no framework dependencies; add bindings separately

## Quick Start Checklist

1. Analyze scope: new SDK or extraction from existing app
2. Design public API surface (exports, types, config)
3. Implement client with typed methods and error handling
4. Configure build for ESM/CJS/types (tsup recommended)
5. Write tests (unit + integration) and examples
6. Publish to npm with proper package.json exports field
