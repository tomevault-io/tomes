# Worktrees

Guide for managing git worktrees in pokayokay.

## When Worktrees Are Created

| Task Type | Default | Override |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| feature | Worktree | --in-place |
| bug | Worktree | --in-place |
| spike | Worktree | --in-place |
| chore | In-place | --worktree |
| docs | In-place | --worktree |
| test | Inherits | explicit flag |

## Key Principles

- **Story-based reuse** — Tasks in the same story share a worktree for related changes
- **Auto dependency install** — Dependencies install automatically on worktree creation
- **Clean completion** — Choose merge, PR, keep, or discard when done
- **Isolation** — All worktrees live in `.worktrees/` (auto-ignored by git)

## Quick Start Checklist

1. Task type determines worktree vs in-place (see table above)
2. Story worktrees are reused across related tasks
3. Dependencies auto-install based on detected lockfiles
4. On completion: merge to main, create PR, keep, or discard
5. Troubleshoot with `git worktree list` if issues arise
