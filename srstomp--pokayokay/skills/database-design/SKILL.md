# Database Design

Design efficient, maintainable database schemas with safe migration strategies.

## Key Principles

- Start from requirements: identify entities, attributes, and relationships first
- Normalize for data integrity, denormalize selectively for read performance
- Design indexes based on actual query patterns, not guesses
- Migrations must be reversible and safe for zero-downtime deployments
- Choose the right ORM — Prisma for type safety, Drizzle for SQL-close, TypeORM for enterprise

## Quick Start Checklist

1. Identify entities and relationships from requirements
2. Design normalized schema (3NF minimum)
3. Add indexes for known query patterns
4. Plan migration strategy (up + down)
5. Choose ORM/query builder based on project needs
6. Set up seed data for development
