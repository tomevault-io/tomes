# PRD Analyzer & Implementation Planner

Transform product requirements into actionable implementation plans with visual kanban tracking.

## When NOT to Use

- **Revising an existing plan** — Use `plan-revision` for modifying task hierarchies or scope changes
- **Starting implementation** — Use `work-session` to begin executing tasks from a plan
- **Quick one-off tasks** — Use `/quick` for tasks that don't need epic/story/task hierarchy
- **Investigating feasibility** — Use `spike` for time-boxed technical investigation before committing to a plan

## Key Principles

- All outputs go to `.claude/` folder (PROJECT.md, tasks.db, features.json, kanban.html)
- Break work into epic → story → task hierarchy (tasks ≤ 8h each)
- Assign skills to features based on type (api-design, database-design, etc.)
- Flag ambiguities before planning — don't assume unclear requirements

## Quick Start Checklist

1. Read the full PRD/brief document
2. Extract goals, features, constraints, and dependencies
3. Classify priorities (P0-P3) and flag ambiguities
4. Break features into epics → stories → tasks with estimates
5. Generate `.claude/` outputs (PROJECT.md, tasks.db, features.json, kanban.html)
6. Identify first skill to run and hand off
