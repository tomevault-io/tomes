# CI/CD Expert

Create, debug, and optimize CI/CD pipelines across platforms.

## Platform Selection

| Platform | Best For | Key Strength |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| GitHub Actions | GitHub repos, open source | Marketplace, native integration |
| GitLab CI | GitLab repos, self-hosted | Built-in registry, Auto DevOps |
| CircleCI | Complex workflows, speed | Parallelism, orbs |
| Azure DevOps | Microsoft/enterprise | Azure integration, YAML templates |
| Bitbucket | Atlassian stack | Jira integration, pipes |

## Key Principles

- **Security first**: Never expose secrets in logs, use environment-specific secrets
- **Reliability**: Idempotent steps, deterministic builds, pinned dependency versions
- **Efficiency**: Cache aggressively, parallelize independent jobs, skip unchanged paths
- **Maintainability**: DRY with reusable workflows/templates, clear naming

## Quick Start Checklist

1. Choose platform based on repository hosting
2. Create pipeline with lint → test → build → deploy stages
3. Configure secrets and environment variables
4. Set up caching for dependencies and build artifacts
5. Add deployment strategy (blue-green recommended for production)
6. Review security checklist before going live
