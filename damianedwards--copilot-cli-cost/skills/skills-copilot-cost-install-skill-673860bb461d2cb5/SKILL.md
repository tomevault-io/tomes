description: Enable the Copilot CLI Cost /cost command and panel by installing the user-scoped SDK extension shim that imports the installed plugin. Use when this capability is needed.

Use this skill when the user asks to install, enable, set up, or repair the Copilot CLI Cost `/cost` command or cost panel after installing the plugin.

Goal:

- Locate the installed `copilot-cli-cost` plugin under the user's Copilot installed plugins directory.
- Run the plugin's deterministic shim installer script. The shim imports the installed plugin copy; Copilot CLI handles repo-local extension precedence when running inside a checkout.
- Tell the user to enable or reload the `copilot-cli-cost` user extension in `/extensions` if it is not already running.

Use the command for the user's shell.

PowerShell:

```powershell
$installer = Get-ChildItem "$env:USERPROFILE\.copilot\installed-plugins" -Directory -Recurse |
  Where-Object { Test-Path (Join-Path $_.FullName "scripts\install-extension-shim.mjs") } |
  Select-Object -First 1 -ExpandProperty FullName

if (-not $installer) {
  throw "Could not find the installed copilot-cli-cost plugin. Run install.ps1 or install.sh first."
}

node (Join-Path $installer "scripts\install-extension-shim.mjs")
```

Bash/zsh:

```bash
installer="$(find "$HOME/.copilot/installed-plugins" -type f -path '*/scripts/install-extension-shim.mjs' | head -n 1)"
if [ -z "$installer" ]; then
  echo "Could not find the installed copilot-cli-cost plugin. Run install.ps1 or install.sh first." >&2
  exit 1
fi
node "$installer"
```

After the script succeeds, instruct the user:

1. Run `/extensions`.
2. Enable `copilot-cli-cost` under **User**, or toggle it off and on if it was already enabled.
3. Run `/cost help` to confirm the command is available.

Do not overwrite unrelated user extensions. If the installer reports that it refused to overwrite an existing non-Copilot-Cost extension, stop and explain that the user already has a user extension named `copilot-cli-cost`.
