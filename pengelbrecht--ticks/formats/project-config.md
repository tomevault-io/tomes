# Agent Instructions

This project uses **tick** (`tk`) for issue tracking.

## Quick Reference (tk)

```bash
tk ready --json | head -1
tk create "Found edge case" --discovered-from <current-tick> -p 3
tk update <id> --status in_progress
tk note <id> "Investigating auth flow"
tk close <id> --reason "Fixed in this session"
```

## Building tk

Dev builds go to **`./bin/tk`** (gitignored):

```bash
make build && ./bin/tk --help
```

**Never build over `~/.local/bin/tk`.** That binary is shared by every other
agent running on this machine and may carry a hand-applied local patch; a
build from a clean tree silently reverts it and breaks them mid-task.
Replacing it is a release action and needs an explicit
`TK_ALLOW_MACHINE_INSTALL=1 make install`.

## Ticks Skill

The distributable skill lives in `skills/ticks/` and is the source of truth. It covers tracker use and authoring (planning, good ticks, epics, gates); running epics is ticfac's (github.com/pengelbrecht/ticfac), so execution guidance does not belong in this skill. Keep handoff based on git and `.tick/` state, never a harness-private session ID.

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
