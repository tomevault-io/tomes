Supports ten meeting-type variants (standup, planning, review, decision-making, brainstorm, 1-on-1, stakeholder-review, project-kickoff, working-session, exec-briefing). Member of the Meeting Skills Family.

#### meeting-brief
**Path:** `skills/foundation-meeting-brief/SKILL.md`

Produces a private strategic prep document with stakes, stakeholder reads, ranked desired outcomes, key messages, anticipated Q&A, risks, and specific asks. Member of the Meeting Skills Family. Distinct from meeting-agenda because the brief is private by default, not shared with attendees.

#### meeting-synthesize
**Path:** `skills/foundation-meeting-synthesize/SKILL.md`

Cross-meeting archaeology skill. Consumes multiple meeting recaps over a period and surfaces patterns invisible in any single meeting: decision evolution, stakeholder position shifts, stalled threads, contradictions. Produces plain-text timeline, themes, prioritized follow-ups. Member of the Meeting Skills Family.

#### stakeholder-update
**Path:** `skills/foundation-stakeholder-update/SKILL.md`

Produces async communication to stakeholders from a meeting recap.
