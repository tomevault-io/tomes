# Confluence Documentation Skill

## Purpose

Provide standardized templates for creating technical documentation. These templates ensure consistent, high-quality documentation across the project.

## When This Skill Applies

- Creating Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Writing operational runbooks
- Documenting system architecture
- Creating technical specifications
- Writing knowledge transfer (KT) documents

## Existing ADRs (Reference)

| ADR     | Location                                                   | Topic                     |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| ADR-002 | `docs/adr/ADR-002-constants-unification.md`                | Constants organization    |
| ADR-003 | `docs/adr/ADR-003-dependency-upgrade-typescript-fixes.md`  | Dependency upgrades       |
| ADR-004 | `docs/adr/ADR-004-server-component-data-access-pattern.md` | Server component patterns |
| ADR-005 | `docs/adr/ADR-005-ci-infrastructure-services.md`           | CI infrastructure         |
| ADR-006 | `docs/adr/ADR-006-bonus-pdf-private-bucket-security.md`    | Security patterns         |
| ADR-007 | `docs/adr/ADR-007-rendertrust-marketing-pages.md`          | Marketing architecture    |
