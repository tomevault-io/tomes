# evalyn-calibrate

## Pre-flight

1. Verify evaluation runs exist:

```bash
evalyn list-runs --limit 1
```

If no runs: "You need evaluation results first. Invoke `evalyn-eval`."

2. Identify calibration targets:

```bash
evalyn analyze --run <latest-run-id>
```

Look for subjective metrics (type `[llm]`) with pass rates below 90%. Only subjective metrics can be calibrated - objective metrics are deterministic.

## Step 1: Annotate Results

Run interactive annotation with per-metric mode for targeted feedback:

```bash
evalyn annotate --run-id <latest-run-id> --dataset <dataset-path> --per-metric
```

This is an interactive terminal session. The user will:
- See each item's input, output, and LLM judge results
- Agree or disagree with each metric's judgment
- Commands: `[y]es/pass`, `[n]o/fail`, `[s]kip`, `[v]iew full`, `[q]uit`

Aim for 20-30+ annotations. Focus on disagreements. Annotations save immediately - quit and resume anytime.

## Step 2: Run Calibration

Start with the basic optimizer (fast, single-shot analysis):

```bash
evalyn calibrate --metric-id <target-metric> --annotations <annotations-dir>
```

The `--annotations` flag points to the directory containing annotation files (created by `evalyn annotate`).

The output shows alignment metrics:
- **Accuracy**: overall agreement rate
- **F1 Score**: balanced precision/recall
- **Cohen's Kappa**: agreement adjusted for chance

### Optimizer comparison

| Optimizer | Flag | Speed | Best For |
|-----------|------|-------|----------|
| `basic` | `--optimizer basic` | Fast (1 API call) | First pass, small annotation sets |
| `ape` | `--optimizer ape` | Medium | Exploring many prompt variants |
| `opro` | `--optimizer opro` | Medium | Iterative refinement |
| `gepa-native` | `--optimizer gepa-native` | Slow | Best quality, built-in token tracking |
| `gepa` | `--optimizer gepa` | Slow | Evolutionary (requires `pip install gepa`) |
| `evoprompt` | `--optimizer evoprompt` | Medium | Evolutionary mutation/crossover of prompts |
| `textgrad` | `--optimizer textgrad` | Medium | Critique-revise gradient descent on text |
| `miprov2` | `--optimizer miprov2` | Medium | Instruction + few-shot demo co-optimization |
| `promptbreeder` | `--optimizer promptbreeder` | Slow | Self-referential evolutionary prompt search |

Optimizer-specific settings are available as CLI flags (e.g., `--opro-iterations`, `--ape-candidates`, `--gepa-task-lm`, `--gepa-reflection-lm`, `--gepa-max-calls`).

If basic doesn't improve alignment enough:

```bash
evalyn calibrate --metric-id <target-metric> --annotations <annotations-dir> --optimizer gepa
```

## Step 3: Re-evaluate with Calibrated Judges

```bash
evalyn run-eval --dataset <dataset-path> --use-calibrated
```

The `--use-calibrated` flag loads optimized prompts from the `calibrations/` directory.

## Step 4: Compare Results

```bash
evalyn compare --run1 <original-run-id> --run2 <calibrated-run-id>
```

Check whether calibrated pass rates better match your expectations.

## Step 5: Assess and Iterate

View calibration history:

```bash
evalyn list-calibrations
```

If alignment improved: calibration successful. The judges now match your expectations.

If alignment is still poor:
- Try a different optimizer (`gepa` for maximum quality)
- Add more annotations (more data = better calibration)
- Review the metric's rubric in the metrics JSON file - it may need manual editing
- Run `evalyn cluster-misalignments --run-id <run-id>` to see patterns in disagreements

## No Automatic Next Step

This is the terminal skill. The user decides:
- **Iterate**: add more annotations and re-calibrate
- **Fix agent**: if judges are correct and agent has real issues
- **Expand testing**: `evalyn simulate --dataset <path> --modes similar,outlier` then re-evaluate
- **Ship**: export final report with `evalyn export --run <id> --format html`
