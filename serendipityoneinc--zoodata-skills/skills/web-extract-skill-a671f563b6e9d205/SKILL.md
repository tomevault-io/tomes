# Web Extract — Structured Data from the Open Web

Backed by the ZooData WebTools API. Six HTTP endpoints. One API key. **Structured JSON by default — no second LLM pass to parse fields.**

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `{skill_base_dir}/scripts/webtools.py` | Thin CLI wrapper — one subcommand per endpoint. Has the Cloudflare-UA, crawl-warmup, and nested-data-shape quirks baked in. Run `--help` for params. |
| `{skill_base_dir}/references/reference.md` | Full request/response schemas, error codes, billing, edge cases. Load when you need exact field names. |

## Why pick this skill (vs the alternatives in this environment)

| Tool | What it gives you | When to pick it |
|---|---|---|
| **`web-extract`** (this skill) | Page → `{title, summary, sections, key_metrics, outgoing_links, ...}` JSON in one call | You need **page DATA** (price, specs, fields, link graphs) — downstream code or LLM can use the JSON directly without re-parsing |
| `browser-act` | Browser session: click, scroll, type, screenshot | You need to **interact** with a page (login flow, take a screenshot, fill a form) or visually verify rendering |
| `WebFetch` (built-in) | Static URL → markdown | You need a **single static page** as prose, no JS rendering, no structured fields |
| `deep-research` | Multi-source research with citations | You need a **synthesized report** drawing from many web sources, not raw data |
| `monid` | Generic tool-discovery layer | You're not sure which tool to use yet and want to browse options |

**Key advantage**: every other tool above forces a second pass (re-LLM the markdown / re-parse the HTML / extract structure manually). The underlying API returns the structured fields directly — saves a round-trip and tokens.

## Credential

Required: `ZOODATA_API_KEY`.
Get a free key (1,000 credits) at [zoodata.ai/en/api-keys](https://zoodata.ai/en/api-keys).

```bash
export ZOODATA_API_KEY='hms_live_xxx'
# OR persist to disk (keep the file private — 0600; it holds a bearer credential):
mkdir -p ~/.zoodata && chmod 700 ~/.zoodata
(umask 077; echo '{"api_key":"hms_live_xxx"}' > ~/.zoodata/config.json)
```

## Capabilities & Data Flow

- **Network**: only `https://api.zoodata.ai` WebTools endpoints (Bearer `ZOODATA_API_KEY`). Target pages are fetched server-side by ZooData, not from this machine.
- **Execution**: bundled CLI `{skill_base_dir}/scripts/webtools.py` (Python 3, stdlib-only) with exactly the documented subcommands (`scrape`, `interactive`, `search`, `map`, `crawl`, `crawl-status`, `crawl-wait`, `check`) — the full surface is the declared surface.
- **Local files**: none; reads the optional credential store `~/.zoodata/config.json`.
- **Sent to the API**: the target URLs, search queries, and crawl options you request.
- **Credits**: every call consumes credits (crawl bills per page). For large crawls or deep-scrapes, state the estimated cost and confirm before submitting.

## Two ways to drive it

1. **`webtools.py` CLI** (preferred — quirks baked in): UA header, warmup tolerance, retry/backoff, JSON-first defaults all handled. Just run `python {skill_base_dir}/scripts/webtools.py <subcommand>`.
2. **Raw curl / HTTP** (when CLI isn't installed or for ad-hoc calls): every example below also shows the raw POST. **Always set `User-Agent: web-extract-skill/1.0`** — the Cloudflare edge rejects the default Python-urllib UA with HTTP 403 (see Tips).

Endpoint base URL: `https://api.zoodata.ai/openapi/v2/webtools/*`. All POST with JSON body, except `crawl/{id}` (GET).

## Default format: JSON

**This skill defaults to `formats: ["json"]` for every scrape / scrape-interactive / search-with-scrapeOptions call.** The API itself defaults to `["markdown"]`, but JSON gives the agent structured fields (title, summary, sections, key_metrics, outgoing_links, page_type, …) that compose better with downstream tools and are usually smaller to put back into context.

**Switch to `markdown` only when** the user explicitly asks for "the article text" / "clean prose" / "as markdown", or when the page is genuinely article-shaped (long-form blog post / news / docs) and structured fields wouldn't help. **Switch to `rawHtml`** only when the user needs DOM access (custom CSS selector extraction, table parsing the API didn't structure, embedded `<script>` data, etc.). Request multiple formats in one call (`["json","markdown"]`) when you genuinely need both — but never silently fall back to markdown when the user didn't ask for it.

## When to use

| User intent | Endpoint | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Fetch one URL as structured JSON (default) | `POST /scrape` `formats:["json"]` | 1 credit |
| Fetch one URL as markdown (user explicitly asked) | `POST /scrape` `formats:["markdown"]` | 1 credit |
| Fetch one URL as raw HTML (user needs DOM) | `POST /scrape` `formats:["rawHtml"]` | 1 credit |
| Same as above, but page needs JS / login / click-through / scroll | `POST /scrape-interactive` | 1 credit |
| Google search → list of result URLs | `POST /search` (SERP-only) | 1 credit |
| Google search → URLs + structured JSON for each | `POST /search` `scrapeOptions:{format:"json"}` | 1 credit per returned result |
| List all URLs reachable from a website | `POST /map` | 1 credit |
| Recursively pull every page of a site (async) | `POST /crawl` + `GET /crawl/{id}` poll loop | 1/submit + 1/poll |

## Quick start (CLI — recommended)

Shorthand: `WT="python {skill_base_dir}/scripts/webtools.py"`

```bash
# 1. Scrape one URL as structured JSON (default)
$WT scrape https://example.com
# → data.json = {title, summary, sections, key_metrics, outgoing_links, author, date, page_type, ...}

# 2. Scrape as markdown (user explicitly asked for prose)
$WT scrape https://example.com --format markdown

# 3. Need BOTH JSON and markdown in one call
$WT scrape https://example.com --format json --format markdown

# 4. JS-heavy page — wait, click "Load more", scrape
$WT interactive https://example.com --actions '[
  {"type":"wait","milliseconds":1500},
  {"type":"click","selector":"button.load-more"},
  {"type":"wait","milliseconds":1000}
]'

# 5. SERP-only search (cheap — 1 credit total, regardless of result count)
$WT search "best wireless earbuds 2026" --limit 10

# 6. Deep-scrape every search result as JSON (1 credit per result)
$WT search "best wireless earbuds 2026" --limit 5 --deep-scrape

# 7. Search restricted to specific domains, last 24h
$WT search "python async" --limit 20 --tbs qdr:d \
  --include-domains "python.org,realpython.com"

# 8. Discover every URL on a docs site under /api/
$WT map https://docs.example.com --include-paths "/api/.*" --limit 1000

# 9. Crawl + poll in one shot (handles warmup, paginates pages internally)
$WT crawl-wait https://blog.example.com --limit 200 --max-depth 3 \
  --poll-interval 10 --max-wait 1800

# 9b. Or submit + manual poll
$WT crawl https://blog.example.com --limit 200 --max-depth 3
$WT crawl-status job_xxx --skip 0 --limit 100

# 10. Verify auth + credits (1 credit — scrapes example.com)
$WT check
```

Run `$WT <subcommand> --help` for every flag on any subcommand.

## Same calls via raw curl

When the CLI isn't available (no `python3` / offline / restricted env), every endpoint also takes a plain JSON POST:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST https://api.zoodata.ai/openapi/v2/webtools/scrape \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZOODATA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "User-Agent: web-extract-skill/1.0"   `# REQUIRED — see Tips` \
  -d '{"url":"https://example.com","formats":["json"]}'
```

See `references/reference.md` for the full JSON body shape of every endpoint. **Any non-curl HTTP client must set a custom `User-Agent` header** — Cloudflare's edge blocks the default Python-urllib UA with HTTP 403 (error code 1010).

## Key parameters at a glance

Full schemas are in `references/reference.md`. Load that when you need exact field names or are debugging.

**`/scrape`**: `url` (required), `formats: ["json"|"markdown"|"rawHtml"]` — **skill default `["json"]`** (API itself defaults to `["markdown"]` if `formats` omitted; always pass it explicitly). Max 3 formats per call.

**`/scrape-interactive`**: `url`, `formats`, `actions: [...]` — 7 action types (`wait`/`click`/`write`/`press`/`scroll`/`scrape`/`executeJavascript`). Max 50 actions, cumulative `wait` ≤ 60s.

**`/search`**: `query` (supports inline Google operators), `limit` (1–20, default 10), `sources` (`["web","news","images"]`), `tbs` (`qdr:d|w|m|y`), `includeDomains`/`excludeDomains` (bare hostnames, max 20 each), `scrapeOptions: {format:"markdown"|"json"}` (presence triggers deep-scrape).

**`/map`**: `url`, `limit` (1–100000, default 5000), `search` (keyword rank filter), `sitemapMode` (`include`/`only`/`skip`), `includeSubdomains` (default true), `includePaths`/`excludePaths` (regex), `ignoreQueryParameters` (default **true**).

**`/crawl`**: `url`, `limit` (1–10000, default 100), `maxDepth` (1–10), `includePaths`/`excludePaths`, `allowSubdomains`, `sitemapMode`, `ignoreQueryParameters` (default **false** — opposite of /map), `crawlEntireDomain`.

**`GET /crawl/{job_id}`**: query params `skip`, `limit` (1–1000). `data` is an array of page-scrape blobs. `meta.total` is the running total; compare against `data.length` to detect completion.

## Tips

- **🚨 Cloudflare 1010 trap (Python / non-curl HTTP clients).** The Cloudflare edge in front of `api.zoodata.ai` blocks default Python `Python-urllib/X.Y` User-Agent → HTTP 403. ALWAYS set an explicit `User-Agent` header (any non-default value works, e.g. `User-Agent: web-extract-skill/1.0`). curl is fine out of the box; Python / Go / Node fetch / requests all need it.
- **Crawl `GET /crawl/{job_id}` warmup gotcha**: for ~5–10 seconds after `POST /crawl` returns the job_id, polling may return `NOT_FOUND`. This is the job still registering, not a real "not found." Tolerate it: retry with 5s sleep up to ~3 times before giving up.
- **`crawl-status` response shape**: `data` is an **object** `{id, status, completed, total, data: [pages...]}` — the page array is nested at `data.data`. Status values: `"queued"`, `"running"`, `"completed"`, `"failed"`. (Failed `success:false` responses cost 0 credits.)
- **A `success:true` response can still contain an error page.** Always check `data.meta.statusCode` (or per-result `meta.statusCode` for search) before trusting content.
- **Deep-scrape `/search` may return fewer than `limit`** results — pages with no extractable content in the chosen format are dropped.
- **Domain filters are bare hostnames only.** `https://github.com` or `github.com/path` → 422. Use `github.com`.
- **`includePaths` / `excludePaths` are regex, not glob.** Use `/blog/.*` not `/blog/**`.
- **Crawl job IDs are tenant-scoped.** Polling someone else's job returns 404 (indistinguishable from "job not found" — by design).
- **Refused requests (`ACCESS_DENIED`, `RATE_LIMITED`) are NOT billed.** `TIMEOUT` and `CONTENT_UNAVAILABLE` are.
- **Polling costs 1 credit per call.** For large crawls, batch your polls — fetch with `limit=1000` and space polls ≥10s apart.
- **Format choice (skill default = JSON)**: `json` is the default — gives structured fields (`title/summary/sections/key_metrics/outgoing_links/page_type/...`) that downstream tools can consume directly. Use `markdown` only when the user asks for clean prose or the page is article-shaped (blog post / docs); use `rawHtml` only when DOM access is needed (custom selectors, table parsing the JSON layer doesn't expose).

## On Missing Key (no credentials configured)

**BEFORE calling any endpoint**, verify a credential is configured. Reliable check: `python {skill_base_dir}/scripts/webtools.py check` — exits 2 if no key is found in env (`ZOODATA_API_KEY`) or the config file (`~/.zoodata/config.json`). A `[ -z "$ZOODATA_API_KEY" ]` test alone is NOT sufficient.

When no key is found through any mechanism:

1. **STOP.** Do not call any endpoint.
2. **Do NOT fall back to "partial output from training data" / "describe the page from common knowledge" / "for reference only" preview.** This skill's deliverable is structured extraction of THIS URL's actual content — without the data, there is no deliverable.
3. **Tell the user, in their language**, all three of:
   - "`ZOODATA_API_KEY` is not set — I need this to fetch the page."
   - **Get a free key** (1,000 credits, no credit card): https://zoodata.ai/en/api-keys
   - **Configure** via one of:
     - `export ZOODATA_API_KEY='hms_live_xxx'` (session only)
     - `mkdir -p ~/.zoodata && chmod 700 ~/.zoodata && (umask 077; echo '{"api_key":"hms_live_xxx"}' > ~/.zoodata/config.json)` (persistent; keep the file private — 0600)

## On 401 Invalid Key

When any endpoint returns HTTP 401:

1. **STOP further calls immediately.** A rejected key won't be accepted on retry — every subsequent call will return 401 too.
2. **Tell the user**: their `ZOODATA_API_KEY` was rejected (invalid, revoked, or expired). Direct them to [zoodata.ai/en/api-keys](https://zoodata.ai/en/api-keys).
3. If you collected partial output before failure, show it and mark partial. **Do not fabricate** the rest — no "training-data fallback" / "page description from common knowledge" substitution.

## On 402 Credit Exhausted

When any endpoint returns HTTP 402:

1. **STOP further calls.**
2. Report partial findings already gathered, plus the `creditsRemaining` number from the last successful call.
3. Point the user at [zoodata.ai/en/pricing](https://zoodata.ai/en/pricing) to top up. **Do not fabricate** the rest — no "common-sense page summary" filler in place of a real fetch.
