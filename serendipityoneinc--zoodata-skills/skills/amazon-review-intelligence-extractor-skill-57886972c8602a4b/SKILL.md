# Amazon Review Intelligence Extractor — 11 Dimensions, 1B+ Reviews

Pre-analyzed consumer insights. Pain points, buying factors, user profiles, differentiation gaps.

## Files
- **Script**: `{skill_base_dir}/scripts/zoodata.py` — run `--help` for params
- **Reference**: `{skill_base_dir}/references/reference.md` (field names & response structure)

## Credential
Required: `ZOODATA_API_KEY`. Get free key at [zoodata.ai/api-keys](https://zoodata.ai/en/api-keys)

## Capabilities & Data Flow

- **Network**: only `https://api.zoodata.ai` (Bearer `ZOODATA_API_KEY`). Setting `ZOODATA_BASE_URL` to an untrusted host (anything other than `api.zoodata.ai` / `*.zoodata.ai` / localhost) makes the CLI **refuse the request and withhold the key** — the Bearer token is never sent to an untrusted host.
- **Execution**: bundled shared ZooData CLI `{skill_base_dir}/scripts/zoodata.py` (Python 3, stdlib-only). This skill allows `analyze`, `review-deepdive`, `product`, `categories`, `check`, plus the review fallback toolkit (`reviews-raw` / `review-tag-prompt` / `review-reduce-prompt` / `review-aggregate`). Do not invoke unrelated subcommands for this skill's tasks — the bundled manifest `{skill_base_dir}/scripts/allowed-commands.json` enforces this: the CLI refuses out-of-scope subcommands with a structured `COMMAND_NOT_ALLOWED` error before any API request.
- **Local files**: a private temporary working dir (created with `mktemp -d`, removed when the fallback completes) during the review fallback; reads the optional credential store `~/.zoodata/config.json`.
- **Sent to the API**: keywords, category paths, ASINs, marketplace/date and numeric filter values only. **Never sent**: budget, experience level, risk tolerance, or any other user-profile text — profile inputs map client-side to numeric filters.
- **Credits**: every API call consumes account credits. For broad or ambiguous requests, state the estimated credit cost and confirm with the user before running multi-call scans. The composite `review-deepdive` command executes ~14+ API calls (~10-20 credits) in ONE invocation and has NO skip/trim flags — under a credit cap, use the granular commands instead.

## Shared CLI Contract

Before selecting or invoking the first command, read and apply the local `references/cli-contract.md`. Reapply it after every granular or composite result and before any fallback, additional call, state write, interpretation, or user-facing report. Use this skill's fallback logic only when the shared contract classifies the result as non-terminal.

### Local Interface Failure Output

For a terminal interface failure, respond in the user's language that the review analysis could not be completed, followed by the succeeded and failed endpoint identifiers. Do not generate pain-point rankings, sentiment conclusions, listing copy, or differentiation recommendations. Keep control tokens, parameters, and retry logs internal unless diagnostics are requested.

## Input (one of)
- **Single ASIN**: "Analyze reviews for B09V3KXJPB"
- **Multi-ASIN**: "Compare review pain points across these 5 competitor ASINs"
- **Category-wide**: keyword/category name → resolve via `categories` first (need ≥3-level deep path)

## API Pitfalls (CRITICAL)
- `reviews/analysis` needs **50+ reviews**. Fallback chain when sample is insufficient:
  1. **Lightweight**: `realtime/product` ratingBreakdown — only star distribution, no themes
  2. **Full 11-dim insights**: see "Insufficient Data Fallback" section below — use the
     local toolkit (`reviews-raw` + `review-tag-prompt` + `review-reduce-prompt` +
     `review-aggregate`) to bypass `/reviews/analysis` entirely
- **labelType** is NOT an API request parameter — the API returns all 11 dimensions in one call. Filter by `labelType` client-side from the `consumerInsights` array.
- Category mode needs precise path (≥3 levels) — broad categories = diluted insights
- Field name is `reviewRate` (NOT the legacy `reviewPercentage` from API v1) for mention frequency
- ASIN-specific endpoints don't need `--category`; keyword-based ones do
- **Category auto-detection**: categoryPath is auto-detected from target ASIN. If `category_source` in output is `inferred_from_search`, confirm with user

## On Missing Key

When `ZOODATA_API_KEY` is not set (verify via `python {skill_base_dir}/scripts/zoodata.py check` — exits 2 if no key in env or `~/.zoodata/config.json`), stop before any evidence call. Tell the user that a ZooData API key is required, link to https://zoodata.ai/en/api-keys, and explain that the key may be set in the environment or local config. Do not substitute public knowledge or a "for reference only" analysis.
## On 401 Invalid Key

When `_transport.status=401`, stop further calls, tell the user that the configured key was rejected, direct them to https://zoodata.ai/en/api-keys, and do not fabricate missing data.

## On 402 Credit Exhausted

When `_transport.status=402`, stop further calls. Report where the workflow stopped, any compatible partial findings already gathered, and returned credit metadata when present; direct the user to https://zoodata.ai/en/pricing and do not fabricate missing data.

## 11 Analysis Dimensions
`painPoints` · `issues` · `positives` · `improvements` · `buyingFactors` · `keywords` · `userProfiles` · `scenarios` · `usageTimes` · `usageLocations` · `behaviors`

## Unique Logic

### Analysis Modes
- **Category mode**: all reviews in category → market-level insights
- **ASIN mode**: specific products → competitive analysis
- Choose based on user intent. Category = broader, ASIN = deeper.

### Pain Point Impact Ranking
Rank differentiation opportunities by: **frequency × avg rating delta**
"Top pain point: durability — mentioned in 27/471 reviews (5.7%), avg rating 2.4 when mentioned"

| reviewRate | Frequency Level | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|---------------|
| >10% | 🔴 Critical | Mentioned by 1 in 10 buyers — must address in product design 📊 |
| 5-10% | 🟡 Significant | Common complaint — differentiator if solved 📊 |
| 2-5% | 🟠 Notable | Worth mentioning in listing if you solve it 📊 |
| <2% | 🟢 Minor | Edge case — deprioritize unless easy fix 🔍 |

| avgRating when mentioned | Severity |
|--------------------------|----------|
| <2.5 | Severe — causes returns/1-star reviews 📊 |
| 2.5-3.5 | Moderate — disappoints but doesn't cause returns 🔍 |
| >3.5 | Mild — noticed but not deal-breaker 🔍 |

**Differentiation Priority** = High frequency + Low avgRating = Biggest opportunity 🔍. If top 3 pain points all have reviewRate >5% and avgRating <3.0, there is a clear product improvement opportunity 💡. If all pain points have reviewRate <2%, the category is well-served — differentiation through reviews is limited 🔍.

⚠️ **Small-sample caveat (N < 50)**: The reviewRate thresholds above assume ≥50 reviews. With smaller samples (e.g. fallback toolkit with 14 reviews), every single mention = 1/N which already crosses 5-10%. Rules to apply when `reviewCount < 50`:
- Demote single-mention pain points / positives from 📊 to 🔍 (directional, not data-backed)
- In the report, surface a "Sample-size advisory" banner above all percentage-based tables
- Prefer reporting `count` alongside `reviewRate` so readers can judge weight themselves
- Do NOT trigger "🔴 Critical / clear improvement opportunity" 💡 verdicts on counts of 1
- **Never attach a table-level or section-header 📊 label** when ANY row inside is single-mention (🔍-demoted). A header 📊 implies the entire table is data-backed, which contradicts the per-row demotion rule and smuggles 🔍 data back into the 📊 tier via visual grouping. Either:
  - (a) Omit the header-level confidence label entirely and let individual rows carry their own labels, OR
  - (b) If the header must carry a label, use the LOWEST confidence present in any row (🔍 if any row is 🔍; 📊 only if EVERY row qualifies as 📊 on its own — i.e. all counts ≥ 2 when N<50)

### Consumer Profile Synthesis
Combine `userProfiles` + `scenarios` + `usageTimes` + `usageLocations` → complete buyer persona.

### Listing Copy from Reviews
Quote actual customer words from `positives` — these are proven converting phrases. High-frequency positive elements (reviewRate >5%) should appear in title or first bullet 💡.

### Competitor Comparison
Align dimensions (pain points vs pain points) across products. If competitor review data unavailable, use brand-detail sampleProducts + note limitation.
- **Your pain point rate < competitor's**: Advantage — highlight in listing 💡
- **Your pain point rate > competitor's**: Risk — address in product iteration 💡
- **Both high on same pain point**: Category-wide issue — solving it is a strong differentiator 🔍

## Composite Command
```bash
python3 {skill_base_dir}/scripts/zoodata.py review-deepdive --target-asin "<ASIN>" [--keyword "<kw>"] [--category "<path>"]
```
Optional: `--comp-asins "<asin1>,<asin2>"` for comparison.
Runs: reviews × 11 dimensions + competitors + realtime + market context + price/trend.
(`<placeholders>` are LITERAL — replace with actual values, no curly braces in commands.)

### Detecting when to fall back

After `review-deepdive` runs, programmatically inspect its JSON output for sparse
review aggregation. The composite continues past review failures, so success is NOT
proof of usable insights. Detection rule:

```python
import json
deepdive = json.load(open("deepdive.json"))
reviews_section = deepdive.get("reviews", {})
# review-deepdive currently makes one /reviews/analysis call per labelType (target_painPoints,
# target_positives, etc.). All-fail means switch to fallback.
all_failed = all(
    sub.get("success") is False
    or not (sub.get("data") or {}).get("consumerInsights")
    for sub in reviews_section.values()
    if isinstance(sub, dict)
)
target_review_count = (deepdive.get("target_realtime", {}) or {}).get("data", {}).get("ratingCount", 0)
# Fallback triggers if ANY of these are true:
needs_fallback = (
    all_failed
    or target_review_count < 50
    or any((sub.get("error") or {}).get("code") == "INSUFFICIENT_REVIEWS"
           for sub in reviews_section.values() if isinstance(sub, dict))
)
```

If `needs_fallback` is True, run the "Insufficient Data Fallback" workflow below.
**Important**: the fallback REPLACES ONLY the review-analysis piece. Keep using the
deepdive's other outputs (`target_realtime`, `competitors`, `market`, `brand_overview`,
`price_band_overview`, `product_history`) for the corresponding report sections.

## Insufficient Data Fallback

When `/reviews/analysis` cannot produce meaningful aggregation, fetch raw reviews live
from Amazon and use this skill's own LLM (you) to perform Map/Reduce in-context. No
external LLM service or API key is required.

**Working directory convention**: create a per-run temp dir to keep intermediate files
together. Create it with `mktemp -d` (private, 0700 — not a predictable path) and keep
`raw.json`, `tagged.json`, `clusters.json`, `insights.json` inside it. Example:
```bash
WORK=$(mktemp -d)
```
Remove the directory (`rm -rf "$WORK"`) after Step 4 succeeds or the workflow aborts.

### Step 1 — Fetch raw reviews

```bash
python3 {skill_base_dir}/scripts/zoodata.py reviews-raw \
    --asin <ASIN> [--marketplace US] [--max-pages 10] > $WORK/raw.json
# Cost: 1 credit/page, 10 reviews/page, hard cap 100 (10 pages).
# Stops automatically when nextCursor=null (small-volume ASINs may exhaust earlier).
# For cost control: --max-pages 5 = 50 reviews / 5 credits / ~30s.
```

Then save just the reviews array for downstream tooling:
```bash
python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(open('$WORK/raw.json'))['data']['reviews']; json.dump(d,open('$WORK/reviews_array.json','w'),ensure_ascii=False)"
```

### Step 2 — Map (per-review tagging)

`review-tag-prompt` renders the prompt **but does NOT call any LLM** — YOU (this skill's
LLM) produce the JSON. The template is uniform per review, so render it ONCE to learn
the schema, then mass-produce tags for all reviews in a single in-context pass.

```bash
# Render the prompt for ONE review to learn the schema (do this once per skill run)
python3 {skill_base_dir}/scripts/zoodata.py review-tag-prompt \
    --review "$(python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.dumps(json.load(open(sys.argv[1]))[0]))' $WORK/reviews_array.json)" \
    [--product-title "..."] [--product-category "..."]
```

The schema you must produce per review (12 fields, all required, empty arrays for empties):
```json
{
  "sentiment": "positive|neutral|negative",
  "mentioned_scenarios": [], "mentioned_issues": [], "mentioned_positives": [],
  "mentioned_improvements": [], "mentioned_buying_factors": [],
  "mentioned_pain_points": [], "user_profiles": [],
  "mentioned_usage_times": [], "mentioned_usage_locations": [],
  "mentioned_behaviors": [], "keywords": []
}
```

After producing tags for all N reviews, save them as a JSON array preserving review order:
```bash
# Save your in-context output as the array (example structure)
cat > $WORK/tagged.json <<'EOF'
[ {tag obj for review[0]}, {tag obj for review[1]}, ... ]
EOF
```

### Step 3 — Reduce (semantic clustering per dimension)

First extract unique candidate phrases per dimension from `tagged.json`:

```python
import json
from collections import defaultdict
tagged = json.load(open(f"{WORK}/tagged.json"))
DIMS = ["mentioned_scenarios","mentioned_issues","mentioned_positives",
        "mentioned_improvements","mentioned_buying_factors","mentioned_pain_points",
        "user_profiles","mentioned_usage_times","mentioned_usage_locations",
        "mentioned_behaviors","keywords"]
candidates = {d: sorted({el.strip().lower() for t in tagged for el in (t.get(d) or [])}) for d in DIMS}
```

Then for EACH of the 11 dimensions, render the reduce prompt and YOU produce clusters:

```bash
python3 {skill_base_dir}/scripts/zoodata.py review-reduce-prompt \
    --label-type positives \
    --candidates '["comfortable","comfy","very comfortable",...]'
# → YOU produce {"clusters": [{"canonical": "Comfortable Fit",
#                              "members": ["comfortable","comfy","very comfortable"]}]}
```

Assemble all 11 dimension cluster outputs into one `clusters.json`:
```json
{
  "mentioned_scenarios": [{"canonical": "...", "members": [...]}],
  "mentioned_issues":    [{"canonical": "...", "members": [...]}],
  ... (all 11 dims, even if empty: use [])
}
```

**Keywords dim chunking**: when `keywords` has >150 unique candidates, split into
chunks of ~150, render the reduce prompt per chunk, and merge clusters across chunks
by case-insensitive canonical name match. Other dims rarely exceed 100 candidates.

### Step 4 — Aggregate (no LLM, pure local)

```bash
python3 {skill_base_dir}/scripts/zoodata.py review-aggregate \
    --reviews $WORK/raw.json \
    --tagged $WORK/tagged.json \
    --clusters $WORK/clusters.json > $WORK/insights.json
# Output structure matches /reviews/analysis:
#   { reviewCount, avgRating, sentimentDistribution, consumerInsights[], topKeywords[] }
# Each consumerInsight has: {element, labelType, count, reviewRate, avgRating}
```

Use the same Pain Point Impact Ranking and Differentiation Priority tables above —
**but apply the small-sample caveat** when `reviewCount < 50`.

### Quality flags to surface in the final report

When generating the report from a fallback run, the Data Provenance section MUST flag:

1. **Sample-size warning** — if `reviewCount < 50`, banner above all rate-based tables.
2. **Suspicious review patterns** — scan `raw.json` for clusters of:
   - Same date + ≥3 unverified reviews + similar themes (potential seeded reviews)
   - Same author across multiple ASINs (review farm signal)
   Report these as "🔍 Possible seeded reviews" in Data Provenance.
3. **Spider exhaustion** — if `pages < max_pages` and `capped == false`, note that
   Spider exhausted the visible review window before reaching the 100-cap.

### Competitor Comparison in fallback mode

The default fallback workflow only fetches reviews for the TARGET ASIN.
SKILL.md's "Competitor Comparison" rules (your-rate vs competitor-rate) require
competitor review data, which is NOT available by default in fallback. Two options:

- **Option A (default)**: in the report's Competitor Comparison section, note
  "Pain-rate comparison unavailable in fallback mode — competitor review aggregations
  not fetched". Use only structural comparison (rating, ratingCount, price).
- **Option B (extension)**: for each top-3 competitor ASIN from the deepdive's
  `competitors` output, run Steps 1-4 again per ASIN. Cost: ~10 credits per
  competitor + LLM time. Only do this when the user explicitly asks for sentiment
  comparison.

### Cost / latency benchmark

| Sample size | Fetch | LLM Map+Reduce | Aggregate | Total |
|-------------|-------|----------------|-----------|-------|
| 100 reviews | ~60s + 10 credits | model-dependent (suggest ≤20 concurrent) | <1s | ~90-120s |
| 50 reviews | ~30s + 5 credits | ~half | <1s | ~60s |
| 14 reviews (validated) | ~20s + 2 credits | inline single pass | <1s | ~30s |

**Quality vs `/reviews/analysis`**: comparable 11-dim coverage; finer sizing-direction
splits (small vs large vs inaccurate) than server-side aggregation; properly
distinguishes `painPoints` (problems experienced) from `positives` (problems solved).

## Output
Respond in user's language.

Sections: Review Snapshot → Top 10 Pain Points (with count & %) → Top 10 Positives → Buying Factors → Improvement Wishlist → Consumer Profile → Usage Patterns → Competitor Comparison → Listing Copy Suggestions → Differentiation Roadmap (impact-ranked) → Data Provenance → API Usage

Do NOT invent insights — only report what the API returns. Omit empty dimensions.

**Cross-validation rule** (mandatory): star distribution (`ratingBreakdown`) should match
sentiment distribution (from `reviews/analysis` OR fallback Map tags). Compute:
- 4-5★ % vs `positive` %
- 3★ % vs `neutral` %
- 1-2★ % vs `negative` %

If any band mismatches by >15 percentage points, **re-examine the Map tags before
publishing**. Common causes: LLM mis-classifying a 5★ "didn't love it but works" as
positive; non-English reviews mis-tagged. Document residual mismatch in Data Provenance.

### Language (required)

Output language MUST match the user's input language. If the user asks in Chinese, the entire report is in Chinese. If in English, output in English. Exception: API field names (e.g. `monthlySalesFloor`, `categoryPath`), endpoint names, technical terms (e.g. ASIN, BSR, CR10, FBA, credits) remain in English.

### Disclaimer (required, at the top of every report)

> Data is based on ZooData API sampling as of [date]. Monthly sales (`monthlySalesFloor`) are lower-bound estimates. This analysis is for reference only and should not be the sole basis for business decisions. Validate with additional sources before acting.

### Confidence Labels (required, tag EVERY conclusion)

- 📊 **Data-backed** — direct API data (e.g. "painPoint 'durability' mentioned by 27% of reviewers 📊")
- 🔍 **Inferred** — logical reasoning from data (e.g. "durability is the #1 differentiation opportunity 🔍")
- 💡 **Directional** — suggestions, predictions, strategy (e.g. "highlight durability in bullet point #1 💡")

Rules: Strategy recommendations and listing copy suggestions are NEVER 📊. User criteria override AI judgment.

**Aggregate-label rule (applies to ALL report output, not just fallback)**: NEVER attach 📊 to ANY element that aggregates or groups underlying content when ANY piece of that content is 🔍 or 💡. "Aggregate/grouping elements" include:
- Section headers at EVERY level (`#`, `##`, `###`, `####`) — including top-level summary sections like "Overall Score", "Verdict", "Executive Summary"
- Summary/score lines anywhere in the report (e.g. `## Overall Score — 27/100 · Grade F 📊` is WRONG if any Basis row inside is 🔍)
- Table **column** headers in comparison tables (e.g. `**Target ASIN** 📊` as a column label is WRONG if any cell in that column contains 🔍)
- Table row headers or row-aggregation labels (when the row aggregates multiple cells of mixed confidence)
- Any other visual grouping label — bullet-list group titles, callout box titles, etc.

A group-level 📊 implies the whole block/column/row is data-backed, which smuggles inferred/directional content into the 📊 tier via visual grouping. Either (a) **omit the group-level label entirely** (preferred when content mixes tiers), or (b) use the LOWEST confidence present inside (🔍 if any underlying content is 🔍; 💡 if any is 💡). This is a universal output-quality rule — it applies regardless of which fallback path (if any) was triggered.

**Emoji reservation rule (closely related)**: The three confidence symbols `📊 🔍 💡` are RESERVED for confidence labeling. NEVER use them as decorative prefixes on section headers, table headers, or any aggregate element — even when you also include a correct confidence suffix on the same line. Example:
- ❌ WRONG: `## 📊 Overall Score — 27/100 · Grade F 🔍` (the leading 📊 reads as a data-backed claim even though the trailing 🔍 is correct)
- ✅ RIGHT: `## Overall Score — 27/100 · Grade F 🔍` (no decorative emoji, just the proper confidence suffix)
- ✅ RIGHT: `## 🎯 Overall Score — 27/100 · Grade F 🔍` (use non-reserved decorative icons like 🎯 🧭 📋 📝 📂 🏁 🚨 🏆 🔔 when a visual prefix is desired)

Decorative emoji ≠ confidence label — but from a reader's perspective, a leading `📊/🔍/💡` is indistinguishable from a confidence claim. Reserve these three symbols EXCLUSIVELY for confidence annotation to avoid ambiguity.

### Data Provenance (required)

Include a table at the end of every report:

| Data | Endpoint | Key Params | Notes |
|------|----------|------------|-------|
| (e.g. Market Overview) | `markets/search` | Copy actual `_query.params` | 📊 Full category and selected Top 100 metrics |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

Extract endpoint and params from `_query` in JSON output. Add notes: sampling method, T+1 delay, realtime vs DB, minimum review threshold, etc.

### API Usage (required)

| Endpoint | Calls | Credits |
|----------|-------|---------|
| (each endpoint used) | N | N |
| **Total** | **N** | **N** |

Extract from `meta.creditsConsumed` per response. End with `Credits remaining: N`.

## API Budget: ~20-30 credits
