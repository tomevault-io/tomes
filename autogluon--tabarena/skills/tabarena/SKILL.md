description: Add a new ML model to the TabArena benchmark system. Use this skill whenever the user wants to integrate a new tabular ML model into TabArena — even if they just say "add X model", "integrate X", "support X", or "wrap X for the benchmark". Creates all required files: the AutoGluon model wrapper, the search-space generator, the per-model `info.py`, and the `pyproject.toml` extra (the model is fit-tested automatically by the registry-driven `test_all_models.py` — no per-model test file). Reads existing similar models for inspiration and optionally fetches documentation URLs to understand the new model's API. Use when this capability is needed.

# Add Model to TabArena

This skill integrates a new tabular ML model into the TabArena benchmark.

Every model lives in **one folder** at `packages/tabarena/src/tabarena/models/<ModelKey>/`. That folder contains the wrapper, the HPO generator, and the metadata — and is auto-discovered by `tabarena.models._registry.discover_models()`. There is no separate `benchmark/models/ag/` layout anymore.

Per model, you create up to 5 source files, then edit three existing files. There is no per-model test file — the model is fit-tested automatically by the registry-driven `tests/tabarena/models/test_all_models.py`.

## First: single model or external system?

TabArena has two integration paths; this skill's steps implement the **single model** path, which is
the default:

- **Single model** (default — everything below): one AutoGluon wrapper in `models/<ModelKey>/`,
  fit by TabArena's shared harness. It gets the shared preprocessing + validation protocol, the
  bagged / holdout / outer execution modes, an HPO search space, registry auto-discovery, and
  leaderboard integration.
- **External system**: a self-contained ML system that does its own preprocessing, validation,
  HPO, and/or ensembling — AutoML frameworks, multi-model stacks, LLM/agent pipelines. Systems do
  **not** get a per-model folder or registry entry. Instead: subclass `ExternalSystemModel`
  (`packages/tabarena/src/tabarena/benchmark/exec_models/external.py`) — implement `_fit_system`
  / `_predict` / `_predict_proba`, optionally `cleanup` and the untimed hooks (`warmup_fn`,
  `pre_predict`/`post_predict`) — and run it via `ExternalSystemExperiment`, or
  `SystemConfigGenerator` (`utils/config_utils.py`) with a bundle in `system_experiments=True`
  mode. Runnable references: `examples/advanced/run_quickstart_tabarena_external_system.py` and
  `run_async_tabarena_api_system.py` (async/API-driven).

**Ask instead of assuming**: if what the user wants to add looks like a system — it ensembles or
stacks multiple models, runs its own HPO or validation splits, or is described as a "framework",
"AutoML tool", "pipeline", or "agent" — ask which integration they want before proceeding. When
nothing suggests a system, take the single-model path and continue with Step 0.

## Step 0: Gather inputs

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for the model name. Then collect (ask only for what's missing or unclear):

| Input | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ModelName` | `"TabPFN-2.6"` | Human-readable display name |
| `ModelKey` | `"tabpfnv26"` | Snake_case folder/file key (derive from ModelName) |
| `ClassName` | `"TabPFNv26"` | CamelCase class prefix (derive from ModelName) |
| `ag_key` | `"TA-TABPFN-2.6"` | AutoGluon registry key; prefix with `"TA-"` |
| `ag_name` | `"TA-TabPFN-2.6"` | AutoGluon display name; same as `ag_key` with proper casing |
| `pip_package` | `"tabpfn>=7.0.0"` | Pip install spec for pyproject.toml |
| `doc_url` | `"https://..."` | Documentation / GitHub / paper URL |
| `model_type` | `foundation` | `foundation`, `torch`, or `sklearn` |
| `supports_gpu` | `true` | Whether the model uses GPU |
| `problem_types` | `binary,multiclass,regression` | Supported task types |

**Deriving keys**: `"TabPFN-2.6"` → key `"tabpfnv26"`, class prefix `"TabPFNv26"`. `"TabSTAR"` → key `"tabstar"`, class prefix `"TabStar"`. Strip hyphens, lowercase for key; CamelCase for class.

## Step 1: Understand the model API

If `doc_url` was provided, fetch it with WebFetch to understand:
- Import path (e.g., `from tabstar.tabstar_model import TabSTARClassifier`)
- Constructor parameters and their defaults
- `.fit(X, y, ...)` signature
- `.predict()` / `.predict_proba()` signature
- Key hyperparameters to expose

## Step 2: Pick the right base class and reference model

Choose the most similar existing model to read for detailed inspiration:

| Model type | Base class | Read this reference model |
|---|---|---|
| Torch-based foundation / pre-trained GPU (e.g. TabPFN, SAP-RPT-OSS) | `AbstractTorchModel` | `packages/tabarena/src/tabarena/models/sap_rpt_oss/model.py` |
| Torch NN trained from scratch (e.g. TabM, RealMLP) | `AbstractTorchModel` | `packages/tabarena/src/tabarena/models/tabm/model.py` |
| Non-torch GPU model (e.g. JAX/Flax like TabFM, or any lib that manages its own device) | `AbstractModel` | `packages/tabarena/src/tabarena/models/tabstar/model.py` |
| CPU / sklearn-like (e.g. KNN) | `AbstractModel` | `packages/tabarena/src/tabarena/models/knn/model.py` |

**`AbstractTorchModel` is only for torch-based models.** Its whole purpose is the torch device
machinery — `get_device()` / `_set_device()` are abstract and the load path calls `torch.cuda.is_available()`
(so a non-torch device string like `"gpu"` would crash it). If the model is **not** torch (JAX/Flax,
or any library that manages device placement itself at the process level, e.g. via
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` / `jax.devices()`), inherit **`AbstractModel`** even though it runs on GPU, and
just add the GPU resource methods (`_get_default_resources`, `get_minimum_resources`,
`_get_default_ag_args_ensemble` with `sequential_local`, `_class_tags`, `_more_tags`) — do **not**
implement `get_device`/`_set_device`. `tabstar/model.py` (a GPU foundation model on `AbstractModel`)
is the reference; `tabfm/model.py` is the JAX example.

Read the reference model file now (use the Read tool). Use it as a structural guide — you will adapt rather than copy.

Also read the annotated patterns in `references/model_patterns.md` — it contains templates for `model.py`, `hpo.py`, and `info.py`.

## Step 3: Create new files

Create these files (paths relative to the repo root):

### 3a. `packages/tabarena/src/tabarena/models/{ModelKey}/__init__.py`
Re-export the public symbols so `from tabarena.models.{ModelKey} import ...` works:
```python
from __future__ import annotations

from tabarena.models.{ModelKey}.hpo import gen_{ModelKey}
from tabarena.models.{ModelKey}.info import {ModelKey}_info, {ModelKey}_method_metadata

__all__ = ["gen_{ModelKey}", "{ModelKey}_info", "{ModelKey}_method_metadata"]
```

### 3b. `packages/tabarena/src/tabarena/models/{ModelKey}/model.py`

The AutoGluon wrapper class. Use the template in `references/model_patterns.md` section "Model wrapper template". Key points:
- Start with `from __future__ import annotations`
- Inherit from `AbstractTorchModel` (torch-based models) or `AbstractModel` (CPU models **and non-torch GPU models** — see Step 2: JAX/Flax etc. use `AbstractModel`)
- Set `ag_key`, `ag_name`, `ag_priority = 65`, `seed_name = "random_state"`
- Implement `_fit()`, `_set_default_params()`, `supported_problem_types()`
- **Honor the `_fit` contract** (read `references/model_patterns.md` → "The `_fit` contract"). The most common review findings on new wrappers are: ignoring the provided `X_val`/`y_val` (and instead auto-splitting a second holdout), ignoring `time_limit`, hardcoding the thread count instead of wiring `num_cpus`, and label-encoding + `fillna(0)` categoricals when the library handles them natively. `models/realmlp/model.py` is the reference for all of these. (In-context-learning foundation models have no train loop / no eval set, so they legitimately ignore `time_limit` + `X_val` — see `sap_rpt_oss`/`tabstar`/`tabfm`.)
- For GPU models: also implement `_get_default_resources()`, `get_minimum_resources()`, `_get_default_ag_args_ensemble()` (with `fold_fitting_strategy: sequential_local` — **and `refit_folds: True` for foundation/pre-trained TFMs**; see the "Foundation models: set `refit_folds=True`" note in `references/model_patterns.md`. From-scratch NNs omit it), `_class_tags()` (with `can_estimate_memory_usage_static: False`), `_more_tags()` (with `can_refit_full: True`). **Only torch models** (`AbstractTorchModel`) additionally implement `get_device()` / `_set_device()`; non-torch GPU models on `AbstractModel` must NOT (they have no `.to(device)`).
- Docstring must include: description, paper title, authors, codebase URL, license
- Keep optional third-party imports (the wrapped library itself) inside `_fit` / per-method scope so importing this module never requires the optional dep at top-level
- Decide the model's untimed **warm-up** (Step 3g) while you have the library docs in hand

### 3c. `packages/tabarena/src/tabarena/models/{ModelKey}/hpo.py`

The search-space generator. By default use an **empty search space** (like TabPFN-2.6) — only add hyperparameters if the user explicitly asks or if the model has obvious tunable knobs. See template in `references/model_patterns.md` section "hpo.py template".

### 3d. `packages/tabarena/src/tabarena/models/{ModelKey}/info.py`

Defines `{ModelKey}_method_metadata: MethodMetadata` and `{ModelKey}_info: ModelInfo`. `info.py` is the single source the auto-discovery registry walks — populating it correctly is how the model becomes visible to `discover_models()`. See template in `references/model_patterns.md` section "info.py template".

**When you set `ag_key`/`model_key` here, also classify the model in `get_model_family` (Step 4d)** — those keys decide the model's leaderboard family, and skipping this makes it show as ❓ Other on the website.

### 3e. Multi-file support code (optional)

If the wrapper needs helper modules (preprocessors, vendored upstream code, large internal classes), put them in a private subfolder of `packages/tabarena/src/tabarena/models/{ModelKey}/`:

- `_internal/` — for hand-written helpers (preprocessors, internal classes, adapters)
- `_vendor/` — only for code copied verbatim from an upstream project; keep the original layout/license alongside

Both subfolders need their own empty `__init__.py`. Import them from `model.py` via absolute paths, e.g. `from tabarena.models.{ModelKey}._internal.preprocessing import Preprocessor`.

### 3f. Test config (no per-model test file)

There is **no per-model test file**. `tests/tabarena/models/test_all_models.py`
is parametrized over the model registry, so it fits the new model automatically once
its `info.py` is discoverable. It skips on `ImportError` (optional dep missing) and for
GPU-only models without CUDA.

Only touch `tests/tabarena/models/smoke_configs.py` if the model's toy fit needs
a speed-up: add one entry to `SMOKE_OVERRIDES`, keyed by the model's `MethodMetadata.method`
(the registry key), e.g. `"{ModelName}": ModelSmokeTest({"max_epochs": 1})`, or
`ModelSmokeTest(problem_types=("regression",))` for a regression-only model. If the model
fits fine with default hyperparameters on all problem types, add nothing.

### 3g. Warm-up (untimed environment warm-up) — decide, don't skip

TabArena runs an untimed warm-up before every timed fit (`AbstractExecModel.warmup_fn` →
`tabarena.models.warmup.warmup_model_cls`), so one-time per-environment costs — heavy imports,
JIT/kernel compilation, CUDA context creation — don't inflate the measured `time_train_s` /
`time_infer_s` or eat into the fit time limit. Decide what the new model needs (code template
in `references/model_patterns.md` → "Warm-up classmethod"):

| Situation | Warm-up |
|---|---|
| Torch model on `AbstractTorchModel` | **Automatic** (generic torch import + CUDA context). Add a `warmup` classmethod only for *extra* one-time costs (a heavy library import like `transformers`, kernel pre-compilation). |
| Torch-backed model on `AbstractModel` | Declare a `warmup` classmethod calling `warmup_torch(...)` — the generic torch fallback doesn't reach non-`AbstractTorchModel` classes. References: `modernnca`, `xrfm`, `tabstar`. |
| Library JIT-compiles kernels (numba, JAX, custom CUDA) | Call the library's own warm-up / pre-compile entry point if one exists (reference: `chimeraboost`, which requires `chimeraboost>=0.14.1` for its `warmup()`). Disk-cached compilation is the most valuable kind (see limitation below). |
| Heavy compiled-CPU import only | `warmup_imports("<lib>")` in a small `warmup` classmethod (AG built-ins like LightGBM/CatBoost/XGBoost are already covered by the `ag_key` map in `warmup.py`). |
| sklearn-like / lightweight | Nothing. |

Classmethod convention (dispatched by `warmup_model_cls`):
`warmup(cls, *, problem_type=None, num_cpus=None, num_gpus=None, hyperparameters=None, **kwargs) -> None`
— keyword-only, accept `**kwargs`, read only what you need. **Fairness contract**: data-independent
work only; never touch task data or carry task-/data-specific state into the fit.

**This step may need the user's input — ask instead of guessing**: whether the library exposes a
warm-up / pre-compile function (and from which version), and whether its kernel cache persists to
disk, is usually not in the docs you fetched. If unclear, ask the user before inventing one.

**Always raise the limitation to the user (in the Step 8 report)**: warm-up warms the *main job
process* and *disk-backed caches* only. Bagged fits with parallel (Ray) fold fitting spawn fresh
worker processes whose imports / CUDA init still land in the measured fit time — only disk-backed
compile caches (e.g. numba's) carry over to workers. See the `tabarena/models/warmup.py` module
docstring for the authoritative scope.

**Inference-side (untimed predict prep)**: the exec model persists the fitted model in memory
around the inference timer by default (`AGWrapper.persist`, memory-guarded), so model loading
from disk is untimed when it fits in memory. A model wrapper can additionally declare an
**instance** method `prepare_for_inference(self) -> None` — called untimed on every persisted
model object (including bagged children) right before the inference timer — for model-only prep
such as moving weights offloaded at the end of `_fit` back to the inference device. It must never
touch test data. The hook is dispatched on every fit path: bagged/holdout via persist, and
outer/direct fits (`AGModelWrapper`, whose model is already in memory) directly. Beyond that: do **not** defer heavy one-time work to the first `_predict` when
it can live in `_fit` or `warmup`; data-dependent first-predict work (e.g. `torch.compile` on the
real batch) is deliberately measured — don't try to warm it.

## Step 4: Edit existing files

Edit both locations **in a single pass** (read each file first, then edit):

### 4a. `packages/tabarena/src/tabarena/models/__init__.py`

Add a lazy entry for the new class so `from tabarena.models import {ClassName}Model` works:
```python
_LAZY_CLASSES = {
    ...
    "{ClassName}Model": "tabarena.models.{ModelKey}.model",
    ...
}
```
Also add `"{ClassName}Model"` to `__all__` and (under `TYPE_CHECKING`) to the static `from tabarena.models.{ModelKey}.model import {ClassName}Model` block, both kept alphabetised.

### 4b. `packages/tabarena/src/tabarena/models/utils.py` — no edit needed

**No longer required** (auto-registry). `get_configs_generator_from_name()` now resolves the
search space from the auto-discovered `MODEL_REGISTRY` (via `get_model_info_from_name`); there is
no `name_to_import_map` dict to update. Creating `info.py` (Step 3d) is what makes the model
resolvable by name. Leave `utils.py` untouched.

### 4c. `packages/tabarena/pyproject.toml`

The `pyproject.toml` defines a per-model extra for every supported model, plus three union extras built via **self-references** (`"tabarena[<name>]"`):

- **`benchmark`** — the curated core set used for standard benchmarking. Stable and resolver-friendly. Do **not** add a new model here unless the user explicitly says it belongs in the core set.
- **`extended`** — the layered set installed on top of `benchmark` for the broader model zoo. **This is where most new models go.**
- **`all`** — experimental union of `benchmark` + `extended` + special-cased extras like `probmetrics` (which has conflict-prone deps and is excluded from `extended` on purpose). Updated automatically via `tabarena[extended]`, so usually no manual edit needed unless the model is conflict-prone.

Always declare the pip spec exactly once in the per-model extra, then reference the model by name in the union(s). Never paste the raw `{pip_package}` into a union extra.

**Step 1 — declare the per-model extra** under `[project.optional-dependencies]`:
```toml
{ModelKey} = ["{pip_package}"]
```

**Step 2 — add it to the right union via self-reference**:

| Situation | Edit |
|---|---|
| **Default**: new extended model | Add `"tabarena[{ModelKey}]"` to the `extended` extra. |
| Core benchmark model (only if user explicitly says so) | Add `"tabarena[{ModelKey}]"` to the `benchmark` extra. |
| Model has known dependency conflicts (rare, like `probmetrics`) | Skip both `benchmark` and `extended`; add `"tabarena[{ModelKey}]"` to `all` only. |
| We reuse only a slice of a heavy library's code (`--no-deps` pattern, like `denselight` reusing LightAutoML's NN stack) | Declare the per-model extra, but leave it OUT of `benchmark`/`extended`/`all` and document the `--no-deps` install (see below). |

After this, users can install the model alone (`uv sync --extra benchmark --extra {ModelKey}`), as part of the extended set (`uv sync --extra benchmark --extra extended`), or via `--extra all`.

**`--no-deps` minimal-reuse pattern.** Sometimes the goal is to reuse only a small part of a large
library (e.g. one model class + its training loop) without pulling that library's heavy,
conflict-prone transitive tree. If the *specific* modules you import resolve using only packages
TabArena already ships (`torch`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `catboost`, `lightgbm`,
`xgboost`, `tqdm`), then the library can be installed with `pip install <lib> --no-deps`. To check:
clone the upstream repo and trace the import chain of *exactly* the modules your wrapper imports
(package `__init__.py`s that only declare `__all__` without eager submodule imports are the enabler —
they let you reach a deep submodule without triggering the whole package). The pip extra (`{ModelKey}
= ["<lib>"]`) still names the library so the drift checker passes, but a plain `pip install
tabarena[{ModelKey}]` would pull the full tree — so keep it out of the union extras and document
the `--no-deps` install in the wrapper docstring + the pyproject comment. `denselight` is the
reference example. Keep all `<lib>` imports lazy (inside `_fit` / a private `_internal/` runner)
so model discovery never needs the optional dep.

**Step 3 — verify the per-model extra matches `info.py`** with the drift checker:

```bash
python -m tabarena.tools.sync_pyproject_extras
```

`packages/tabarena/src/tabarena/tools/sync_pyproject_extras.py` aggregates every `ModelInfo.pip_extra` from the registry and compares it against `[project.optional-dependencies]` in `packages/tabarena/pyproject.toml`, printing per-folder `OK`/`DRIFT`. Add `--check` to make it exit non-zero on drift (CI mode). Run it after editing either side so the two stay in sync.

### 4d. `packages/tabarena/src/tabarena/website/website_format.py` — leaderboard model family

`get_model_family()` decides the model's leaderboard **Type** (emoji) and **TypeName** — one of `Tree-based`, `Foundation Model`, `Neural Network`, `Baseline`, `Reference Pipeline`, or `Other`. It prefix-matches the model's `config_type` against `prefixes_mapping`. A model's `config_type` is its **`model_key`** — which defaults to `ag_key` only when `model_key` is left unset, so the two can differ: e.g. TabFM sets `model_key="TABFM"` with `ag_key="TA-TABFM"`, so its `config_type` is `TABFM`. Add the **uppercased `config_type`** to the correct family list (a leading `TA-` is stripped before matching, so the `TA-`/bare forms are equivalent):

```python
prefixes_mapping = {
    Constants.tree:           [..., "{config_type_upper}"],   # tree-based boosters/forests
    Constants.foundational:   [..., "{config_type_upper}"],   # pre-trained / in-context-learning models
    Constants.neural_network: [..., "{config_type_upper}"],   # NNs trained from scratch
    ...
}
```

If you skip this, the model falls through to `Other` (❓) on the leaderboard. The effect is only visible once the model appears on the website, but it's cheapest to set here while you have the `ag_key` in hand. Matching is by **prefix**, so when one `ag_key` is a prefix of another (e.g. `TABICL` vs `TABICLV2`), list both and keep them in the intended family. This drives only the `Type`/`TypeName` columns of the generated `website_leaderboard.csv` — the plots use a separate grouping — so an already-generated leaderboard can be re-patched in place rather than fully regenerated.

## Step 5: Auto-derived registries (no manual edit)

These pieces pick up the new model automatically once Step 3 lands — do not edit them by hand:

- `packages/tabarena/src/tabarena/models/_registry.py` — `discover_models()` walks `tabarena/models/*/info.py` and collects every `ModelInfo` found. As long as `info.py` exports a top-level `ModelInfo` instance, the model joins `MODEL_REGISTRY`.
- `packages/tabarena/src/tabarena/benchmark/exec_models/registry.py` — auto-derives `tabarena_model_registry` from `get_model_registry()`, so the new class becomes available through the AG registry on the next import.

## Step 6: Lint

Run ruff on the new files (add `tests/tabarena/models/smoke_configs.py` only if you edited it):
```bash
ruff check --fix packages/tabarena/src/tabarena/models/{ModelKey}/
```

Fix any reported issues.

## Step 7: Arena registration (optional — only if the model has been benchmarked)

If the model already has processed + uploaded benchmark results, register it in the arena collection so it appears in the benchmark. For the default `tabarena` arena, edit `packages/tabarena/src/tabarena/contexts/tabarena/methods.py` (read it first):

1. **Import** the `{model_key}_method_metadata` you defined in `info.py` in the alphabetical per-model import block (recent additions use the plain name, e.g. `from tabarena.models.nori.info import nori_method_metadata`).
2. **Add the entry** to `tabarena_method_metadata_collection.method_metadata_lst`, under the matching group comment (CPU vs neural/GPU/foundation models).

This mirrors the **`upload-method`** skill's registration step — use that skill for the full process-and-upload flow (the entry only resolves to downloadable artifacts once the results are actually uploaded).

**If the model has not been benchmarked yet, skip this step entirely** — `info.py` already declares the metadata for the registry; the collection entry is only needed when results artifacts actually exist.

## Step 8: Report

Summarize what was created/edited:
- List new files created
- List files edited and what was added
- The warm-up decision (Step 3g): what is warmed and why (or why nothing is needed), any open
  question for the user (library warm-up entry point / version), and the worker-process limitation
- Note any TODOs left for the user (e.g., implementing `_predict_proba` if the library API is unclear, tuning `ag_priority`, adding a real search space later, registering benchmark artifacts after a real run)
