# Apple Mail MCP Performance Patterns

## The Core Insight

**The bottleneck is per-subprocess overhead.** Each `osascript` call costs 100-300ms regardless of what it does. All performance work reduces the number of subprocess calls.

## Known Operation Timings

| Operation | Time | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Single `osascript` call overhead | 100-300ms | Minimum cost per subprocess |
| `search_messages` (typical INBOX) | ~1-5s | Depends on mailbox size and filter count |
| `get_message` (single) | <1s | Direct ID lookup |
| `create_draft` (with `send_now=True`) | ~1-2s | Includes Mail.app compose + send |
| `update_message` (bulk read/flag) | ~1-2s | Single script for N messages via `_bulk_repeat_block` |
| `update_message` (move) | ~1-3s | Varies by account type (Gmail slower) |
| `save_attachments` | ~2-5s | Depends on attachment count/size |

## Pattern 1: Use `whose` Clauses for Server-Side Filtering

```applescript
-- GOOD: Server-side filter (fast, Mail.app evaluates internally)
set msgs to (messages of mbox whose sender contains "user@example.com")

-- BAD: Fetch all then filter in Python (slow, transfers all data)
set msgs to every message of mbox
-- then filter in Python loop
```

`whose` clauses let Mail.app filter internally without transferring unmatched messages over IPC. This is 10-50x faster for large mailboxes.

## Pattern 2: Single Script Per Batch Operation

```python
# GOOD: One osascript call for N messages (near-constant time)
script = """
tell application "Mail"
    repeat with msgId in {id1, id2, id3}
        set read status of (first message whose id is msgId) to true
    end repeat
end tell
"""
self._run_applescript(script)

# BAD: N osascript calls for N messages (linear time)
for msg_id in message_ids:
    self._run_applescript(f'tell application "Mail" ...')
```

Batch operations should always build a single AppleScript that handles all items.

## Pattern 3: Use `limit` for Pagination

The `search_messages` tool accepts a `limit` parameter (default: 50). AppleScript uses `items 1 thru N of` for server-side limiting. Always pass a reasonable limit — fetching 10,000 messages when the user wants the latest 10 wastes time.

## Pattern 4: Accept Optional Account/Mailbox Parameters

Message ID lookup is O(accounts x mailboxes) when searching globally. Always accept optional `account` and `mailbox` parameters to narrow the search scope. If the caller knows which account, the search is dramatically faster.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Repeated subprocess calls in loops** — Build one script, execute once
- **Fetching all properties when only some are needed** — Scripts currently fetch a fixed set of fields; when adding a new field, consider whether every caller needs it
- **Not using `whose` clauses** — Manual filtering in Python transfers all data first
- **Default timeout too low for large operations** — Increase from 60s for bulk operations on large mailboxes

## Gmail Performance Notes

Gmail operations are inherently slower than IMAP because:
- Move requires copy + delete (two operations instead of one)
- Label operations don't map cleanly to folder operations
- Search across Gmail labels may scan differently than IMAP folders

**Threading cost scales with folder count (not account size).** IMAP `SEARCH` runs
against one selected mailbox at a time — there is no cross-folder search — so
`get_thread`'s member collection probes each candidate folder in turn. Gmail exposes
every label as an IMAP folder *and* copies each message into every label it carries, so
a thread's members are scattered across many folders. The mitigation is All Mail: enable
Gmail Settings → Labels → "All Mail" → *Show in IMAP*, and `_find_all_mail_folder`
(`\All` SPECIAL-USE, RFC 6154) collapses the probe to that single mailbox holding one
copy of everything. Without it, threading falls back to per-label probing. This is not
Gmail-specific in principle: any IMAP account with dozens of folders pays the same
per-folder cost — non-Gmail accounts are usually fast only because their mail is
concentrated in a handful of folders (INBOX/Sent). See #415 and the `get_thread`
performance callout in `docs/reference/TOOLS.md`.

**Bound the mailbox set on the AppleScript side too — with the unified mailboxes.**
The same "don't visit every mailbox" rule applies to AppleScript lookups, and Mail.app
gives you ready-made bounds: the application-level `inbox`, `sent mailbox`, and
`drafts mailbox` aggregate the corresponding folder across *every* account, so probing
them needs no per-account mailbox iteration and no name matching (which would break on
localized names). `whose id is N` works against them, and `account of (mailbox of msg)`
walks back to the owning account. `_resolve_numeric_anchor_fast` uses this to replace a
`repeat with acc in accounts / repeat with mb in mailboxes of acc` scan: ~1.3s vs ~3.0s
on a 33k-message Gmail account (#419). Keep the full walk as a not-found backstop.

**Don't assume IMAP is the fast side.** Indexed does not mean instant at scale: on that
same account `SEARCH HEADER Message-ID` over a 33k-message All Mail measured ~17s, so
replacing the AppleScript anchor above with an IMAP lookup would have been ~13× *slower*,
not faster. Measure per-phase against a real large account before moving work across the
AppleScript/IMAP boundary — and re-measure, because Gmail's server-side latency swings
by tens of seconds with throttling.

## Profiling

No formal benchmarking infrastructure yet (see issue #31). When added:
- Use 5 iterations per operation
- Calculate mean, stdev, CV%
- Set thresholds at 5x documented baseline
- Detect cold starts (first run > 2x median of remaining)
