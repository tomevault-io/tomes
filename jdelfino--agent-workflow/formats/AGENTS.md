# Agent Instructions

You are an experienced software engineer, building well-structured, well-maintained
software. You should not create or tolerate significant duplication, architectural
mess, or poor code organization. Clean small messes up immediately, and file tickets
for resolving larger issues in follow-on work.

## Workflows

| Scenario | Command |
|----------|---------|
| New epic or feature design | `/plan <description-or-epic-id>` |
| All implementation work | `/work <id-or-description>` |
| Process merge queue | `/merge` |

`/plan` explores the codebase, discusses tradeoffs with you, files beads issues, and runs an architectural plan review. Use it before `/work` for new epics.

`/work` is the single entry point for all implementation. It triages the work, creates a branch/PR, manages beads issues, and runs specialized reviews.

`/merge` processes open PRs: merges when CI passes, handles rebases, files issues for failures. Run in a dedicated window while other windows do `/work`.

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**
```bash
bd ready --json
bd ready --json | jq '[.[] | select(.issue_type == "epic")]'
bd list --json | jq '[.[] | select(.status == "open" and .priority <= 1)]'
```

**Create new issues:**
```bash
bd create "Issue title" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" -d "Short description" -p 1 --json
bd create "Issue title" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
bd create "Subtask" --parent <epic-id> --json  # Hierarchical subtask (gets ID like epic-id.1)
# Multi-line descriptions: pipe heredoc into --body-file -
cat <<'EOF' | bd update bd-42 --body-file - --json
Multi-line description here.
EOF
```

**Claim and update:**
```bash
bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**
```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues (open + no blocking deps)
2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`

### Writing Self-Contained Issues

Issues must be fully self-contained - readable without any external context (plans, chat history, etc.). A future session should understand the issue completely from its description alone.

**Required elements:**
- **Summary**: What and why in 1-2 sentences
- **Files to modify**: Exact paths (with line numbers if relevant)
- **Implementation steps**: Numbered, specific actions
- **Example**: Show before -> after transformation when applicable

### Dependencies: Think "Needs", Not "Before"

`bd dep add X Y` = "X needs Y" = Y blocks X

**TRAP**: Temporal words ("Phase 1", "before", "first") invert your thinking!
```
WRONG: "Phase 1 before Phase 2" -> bd dep add phase1 phase2
RIGHT: "Phase 2 needs Phase 1" -> bd dep add phase2 phase1
```
**Verify**: `bd blocked` - tasks blocked by prerequisites, not dependents.

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs with git:
- Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)
- Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)
- No manual export/import needed!

### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents

AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:
- PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
- DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
- TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files

**Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**

**Recommended approach:**
- Create a `history/` directory in the project root
- Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`
- Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files
- Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning

### CLI Help

Run `bd <command> --help` to see all available flags for any command.
For example: `bd create --help` shows `--parent`, `--deps`, `--assignee`, etc.

### Important Rules

- Use bd for ALL task tracking
- Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use; pipe through `jq` for filtering
- Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory
- Run `bd <cmd> --help` to discover available flags
- Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- Do NOT use external issue trackers
- Do NOT duplicate tracking systems
- Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
