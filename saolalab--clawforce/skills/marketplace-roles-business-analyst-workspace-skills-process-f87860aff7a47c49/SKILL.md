# Process Improvement

## Process Mapping

### Notation (BPMN Simplified)
- ○ Start/End event
- □ Task/Activity
- ◇ Decision gateway
- → Flow direction

### Levels of Detail
1. **L1**: High-level process areas
2. **L2**: Sub-processes
3. **L3**: Detailed activities
4. **L4**: Work instructions

## Analysis Techniques

### Value Stream Mapping
- Identify value-adding vs non-value-adding steps
- Calculate cycle time vs wait time
- Find bottlenecks

### Root Cause Analysis
1. Define the problem
2. Collect data
3. Identify possible causes (5 Whys)
4. Verify root cause
5. Implement solution

## Improvement Framework (DMAIC)

| Phase | Activities |
|-------|-----------|
| Define | Problem statement, scope, goals |
| Measure | Current state, baseline metrics |
| Analyze | Root causes, opportunities |
| Improve | Solutions, pilot, implement |
| Control | Sustain, monitor, document |

## Process Documentation Template

```markdown
## Process: [Name]

### Purpose
Why this process exists

### Trigger
What starts this process

### Inputs
What is needed to start

### Steps
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Decision point
   - If yes: Step 3a
   - If no: Step 3b

### Outputs
What this process produces

### Metrics
How we measure success
