# User Research

## User Interview Question Templates

### Discovery Interview (Problem Discovery)
- What problem are you trying to solve?
- How do you currently solve this problem?
- What's frustrating about your current solution?
- What would make your life easier?
- Walk me through a typical day when you encounter this problem.

### Feature Validation Interview
- How would you use this feature?
- What would make you want to use this?
- What concerns do you have?
- What's missing from this solution?
- Would you pay for this? How much?

### Post-Launch Interview
- Have you tried [feature]? What was your experience?
- What worked well? What didn't?
- What would make you use it more?
- Would you recommend it to others? Why or why not?

## Survey Design Guidelines

### Good Survey Questions
- **Start broad, narrow down** — General questions first, specific later
- **Use closed-ended for quantitative** — "On a scale of 1-5..."
- **Use open-ended for qualitative** — "Tell me about..."
- **Avoid leading questions** — "Don't you think X is great?" → "How do you feel about X?"
- **Keep it short** — 5-10 questions max for high completion rates

### Survey Template
```markdown
# Survey: {Topic}

1. How often do you {relevant action}? (Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Rarely / Never)
2. What's your biggest challenge with {topic}? (Open-ended)
