# Legal Risk Register

| ID | Risk Description | Category | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score | Status | Owner | Mitigation Strategy | Next Review |
|----|------------------|----------|------------|--------|------------|--------|-------|---------------------|-------------|
| LR-001 | [Risk description] | [Contract/IP/Compliance/etc.] | [Low/Med/High] | [Low/Med/High] | [1-9] | [Open/Mitigated/Closed] | [Name] | [Strategy] | [Date] |
```

### Risk Categories
- **Contract**: Contract-related risks (unfavorable terms, breach risk)
- **IP**: Intellectual property risks (infringement, misappropriation)
- **Compliance**: Regulatory compliance risks (GDPR, employment law)
- **Litigation**: Dispute and litigation risks
- **Employment**: Employment law risks (wrongful termination, discrimination)
- **Data**: Data protection and privacy risks
- **Corporate**: Corporate governance risks

### Risk Scoring Matrix

**Likelihood**:
- **Low (1)**: Unlikely to occur (< 10% probability)
- **Medium (2)**: Possible to occur (10-50% probability)
- **High (3)**: Likely to occur (> 50% probability)

**Impact**:
- **Low (1)**: Minimal impact (minor financial loss, no operational impact)
- **Medium (2)**: Moderate impact (significant financial loss, some operational impact)
- **High (3)**: Severe impact (major financial loss, significant operational impact, reputational damage)

**Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact**

- **1-2**: Low Risk — Accept or monitor
- **3-4**: Medium Risk — Mitigate or transfer
- **6-9**: High Risk — Mitigate immediately or avoid

### Risk Response Strategies

1. **Accept**: Risk is acceptable, no action needed
2. **Mitigate**: Implement controls to reduce likelihood or impact
3. **Transfer**: Use insurance, indemnification, or contracts to transfer risk
4. **Avoid**: Eliminate the risk by changing approach or declining opportunity
