# CLAUDE.md — InertiaCable

## Project Overview

InertiaCable is a Ruby gem + React npm package (`@inertia-cable/react`) that adds ActionCable broadcast integration to Inertia.js Rails apps. When a model changes, it broadcasts a lightweight JSON signal over WebSocket; the React client receives it and calls `router.reload()` to re-fetch props through Inertia's normal HTTP flow.

**Key principle**: The controller remains the single source of truth for data — WebSockets carry only signals, not data payloads (except for explicit `broadcast_message_to` direct messages).

## Commands

### Ruby (gem)

```bash
bundle install                    # Install dependencies
bundle exec rspec                 # Run all Ruby specs
bundle exec rspec spec/broadcastable_spec.rb  # Run a single spec file
bundle exec rake                  # Same as bundle exec rspec (default task)
```

### Frontend (React package)

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci                            # Install dependencies (clean)
npm run build                     # Build with tsup
npm run typecheck                 # TypeScript type checking (tsc --noEmit)
npm test                          # Run tests (vitest run)
npm run test:watch                # Run tests in watch mode
npm run dev                       # Build in watch mode
```

### CI Pipeline

CI runs on every PR and push to main (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
- **ruby-specs**: Ruby 3.3, `bundle exec rspec`
- **frontend**: Node 22, `npm ci` + `npm run typecheck` + `npm run build`

## Architecture & Key Patterns

### Ruby Side

- **Broadcastable** (`lib/inertia_cable/broadcastable.rb`): ActiveSupport::Concern mixed into ActiveRecord::Base via the engine. Provides `broadcasts_to`, `broadcasts`, `broadcast_refresh_to`, `broadcast_message_to` and their `_later` variants.
- **Streams::StreamName**: Resolves streamables (models, strings, arrays) into canonical stream names and signs them with HMAC-SHA256 via `ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier`.
- **StreamChannel**: ActionCable channel that verifies signed tokens on subscription — rejects invalid/tampered tokens.
- **BroadcastJob**: ActiveJob wrapper for `_later` (async) broadcast variants.
- **Debounce**: Uses `Rails.cache` to coalesce rapid broadcasts within a configurable delay window.
- **Suppressor**: Thread-local flag to temporarily suppress all broadcasts (e.g., during seeds/migrations).
- **TestHelper**: Minitest-compatible assertions (`assert_broadcasts_on`, `assert_no_broadcasts_on`, `capture_broadcasts_on`) that work with both RSpec and Minitest.

### Frontend Side

- **useInertiaCable**: React hook that subscribes to a signed ActionCable stream, handles client-side debouncing, reconnection, and triggers `router.reload()` on refresh signals or calls `onMessage` for direct messages.
- **InertiaCableProvider**: React context provider wrapping the ActionCable consumer.
- Built with **tsup**, targeting both CJS and ESM outputs with type declarations.

### Payload Types

```json
// Refresh signal (triggers router.reload)
{ "type": "refresh", "model": "Message", "id": 42, "action": "create", "timestamp": "...", "extra": {} }

// Direct message (passed to onMessage callback)
{ "type": "message", "data": { ... } }
```

## Testing Conventions

### Ruby Specs

- Framework: RSpec with `.rspec` config (`--format documentation --color`)
- Database: In-memory SQLite — models and schemas defined inline in spec files
- Rails stub: Minimal `Rails.application` with `secret_key_base` (no full Rails boot)
- ActionCable stub: `server.broadcast` is a no-op; `InertiaCable.broadcast_callbacks` captures broadcasts for assertions
- ActiveJob: Test adapter (`queue_adapter = :test`)
- Each spec resets verifier, suppressor, callbacks, and job queue in `before(:each)`
- Test models are defined at the top of spec files (Board, Post, Article, etc.) — not shared fixtures

### Frontend Tests

- Framework: Vitest with React Testing Library

## Version & Dependencies

- **Ruby**: >= 3.1
- **Rails**: >= 7.0 (actioncable, activejob, activesupport, railties)
- **React**: >= 18.0
- **@inertiajs/react**: >= 1.0
- **@rails/actioncable**: >= 7.0
- **Current version**: 0.2.2 (kept in sync between `lib/inertia_cable/version.rb` and `frontend/package.json`)

## Code Style

- **Ruby**: No rubocop config in the gem root — follows standard Ruby conventions. Uses `ActiveSupport::Concern` for mixins, `mattr_accessor` for module config, thread-local variables for suppression.
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, discriminated unions for payload types, React hooks pattern with `useRef`/`useCallback`/`useEffect`.
- No linter enforced in CI for Ruby; TypeScript is checked via `tsc --noEmit`.

## Common Development Tasks

- **Adding a new broadcast variant**: Add methods to `Broadcastable` (both class and instance level), add a payload builder, update `BroadcastJob` if async support needed, add specs.
- **Modifying stream signing**: Changes go in `Streams::StreamName` and must be mirrored in `StreamChannel` verification.
- **Updating the React hook**: Edit `frontend/src/useInertiaCable.ts`, run `npm run typecheck` and `npm test`.
- **Bumping version**: Update both `lib/inertia_cable/version.rb` and `frontend/package.json` — they must stay in sync.
