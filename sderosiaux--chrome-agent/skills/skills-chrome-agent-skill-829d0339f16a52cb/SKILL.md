## Reading a response

Every mutating action carries `verdict` + `verdict_reason` + `next`. Every pointer-targeted action
also carries `delivery` (a hit test at the coordinate about to be dispatched) and `intercepted_by`
when another element took the event. Every write also carries `value.actual` beside
`value.requested`, read back after `observed_after_ms` — same field and window for `fill`,
`select`, `check`/`uncheck`.

`ok:true` means the command ran, not that the page complied. Read `verdict`, and read
`value.verbatim` after any write, before reporting success. **Branch on `next`, not on the verdict
word.** `next` is one token from a closed set of six: `proceed` `inspect` `retry` `confirm`
`dismiss` `stop`.

| `verdict` | `verdict_reason` | `next` | What to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| `changed` | `tree_delta` | proceed | The page moved; `delta` says how. |
| `changed` | `nodes_moved` | proceed | Same nodes, reordered (a drag landed). |
| `changed` | `focus_only` | proceed | Only focus moved, onto a real element — on a path with no hit test that is the sole sign the action arrived. `focus.to` is often a focusable **ancestor** of what you clicked; read `uid` for the element you aimed at. Focus onto the **document** answers `identical_tree` instead. |
| `changed` | `value_kept` | proceed / **inspect** | The element held it when read back, and no delta could show that (a secret renders as a fixed marker; a first action has no tree to compare). `fill`, `select` and `check`/`uncheck` all reach this row; the evidence is `value.verbatim`. The one row whose `next` depends on more than the reason: if the PAGE read also failed it answers `inspect` — the field is confirmed, the page around it was never seen. |
| `changed` | `values_lost` | **confirm** | It moved AND emptied a field that held a value; `values_lost:[{uid,role,name,was}]` names each. Submitted-and-cleared and discarded-without-sending look identical. Confirm with `assert text --contains` or `network` before re-filling — a re-submit may send the work twice. |
| `navigated` | `document_replaced` | inspect | New document. Every stored uid is dead. |
| `intercepted` | `hit_test_receiver` | dismiss | Another element occupied the aim point and got the event; `intercepted_by` names it (`tag`/`id`/`class`/`uid`/`z_index`/`text`/`modal`). Nothing is known about the target. This is the row you will actually get: 8 interceptions over 61 real sites, all of them this one. Read `tag`/`id`/`class`, not `z_index` — it was `auto` on 7 of the 8. |
| `intercepted` | `modal_dialog` | dismiss | A `<dialog>` opened with `showModal()` (or a fullscreen element) holds the top layer and receives everything outside itself. Press Escape first. Rare — 0 over 61 real sites: `modal` is `el.matches(':modal')`, so the `<div role="dialog">` overlays most sites ship arrive as `hit_test_receiver` instead. |
| `not_kept` | `value_reverted` | **stop** | The write reached the element and it held **nothing** afterwards. Read `value.actual`. Do not fill again — the same write produces the same answer. |
| `not_kept` | `value_rewritten` | **stop** | It holds something **else** — a mask, a trimmer, a normaliser. Read `value.actual` and decide whether that is the value you wanted. |
| `no_effect` | `delivered_no_change` | confirm | Delivery **proven** to the target, and the tree stayed still within `observed_after_ms`. The strongest word available. Repeating is the one thing that cannot help. |
| `unchanged` | `identical_tree` | confirm | The tree was identical while the tool watched. Delivery was **not** proven. |
| `unknown` | `no_baseline` | inspect | First action on this page; nothing to compare against. |
| `unknown` | `read_failed` | inspect | The action ran; reading the page afterwards failed. |
| `unknown` | `identity_unreadable` | inspect | The two trees may not belong to the same document. |
| `unknown` | `aim_point_off_target` | inspect | Two readings **agreed** and the point still could not be aimed at — **nothing was dispatched**, the miss is **stable**, an identical retry misses identically. `aim` tells the two shapes apart: on screen but outside the element's own boxes (wrapped inline box, clipped container) → aim at a child with a box; outside the viewport (a fixed wall, a locked scroll) → change the page's state, no scroll will move it. |
| `unknown` | `scroll_not_settled` | **retry** | Two readings of the aim point **disagreed**: it was still moving. **Nothing was dispatched**, the miss is **transient**, and the retry is the fix. `wait`, then repeat. |
| `not_checked` | `reporting_disabled` | proceed | You passed `--verdict off`. The silence is yours, not the page's. |

`delivery` rides on pointer-targeted actions (`click`, `dblclick`, the `check`/`uncheck` click) and
is what licenses the two strong words:

| `delivery` | Means | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| `target_hit` | The aim point resolved to the target, a descendant, its label's control, or its shadow host. | The only value that permits `no_effect`. |
| `intercepted` | The aim point belongs to an element outside the target's flat subtree. | → `verdict: intercepted`; `intercepted_by` names the receiver. |
| `off_target` | No point could be aimed at and two probes agreed: outside its own client rects, or outside the viewport and pinned there. | Nothing dispatched, so a repeat doubles nothing — but the miss is stable, so it cannot succeed either. Hence `inspect`. |
| `not_settled` | Two probes disagreed: the aim point was still moving when the settle budget ran out. | Nothing dispatched, miss is transient, so repeating is safe and is the fix. Hence `retry`. |
| `js` | Went through a JS `click()`/`MouseEvent`, which performs no hit test. | Interception is inapplicable, not undetected. Licenses nothing. |
| `not_probed` | No hit test ran, or its answer does not cover the document that matters (a target inside an iframe). | Absence of evidence. Licenses no conclusion. |

`--on-intercept` has three modes. `dispatch` (default) sends through any receiver, which is what a
pointer does. `refuse` errors on every interception. `guard` sends through an inert receiver and
refuses one that looks like a control, reading `intercepted_by.actionable` from the same probe
call: a native interactive tag, an ARIA interactive role, `tabIndex >= 0`, or `cursor: pointer`.
An `<iframe>` receiver always refuses under `guard` — its content is opaque, so "inert" could only
be assumed. Any refusal is `ok:false` (exit 1) with the same fields as a dispatch plus
`dispatched:false`, which appears on every response that aimed and sent nothing; `next` says
`dismiss`, and re-aiming duplicates nothing.

**Never report a success the tool did not confirm.** `unchanged` is also what a click swallowed by
an overlay looks like: confirm with `assert` before repeating, because a repeat is a second real
click. `unknown` means the tool could not compare, never "nothing happened" — run `inspect` once
and continue from what you see; the one exception is `scroll_not_settled`, where nothing was
dispatched. `waited_ms` appears only when the action waited for a page load after it. A pointer
event Chrome does not acknowledge within 8 s fails with `ok:false` rather than waiting out
`--timeout`; it may already have reached the page, so run `inspect` instead of repeating. `click`,
`dblclick`, `hover` and `drag` bring their page to the foreground first (a background tab answers
pointer events on a 5 s timer).

**Two blind spots, neither fixable by retrying.** The observation window is fixed at 60 ms
(`observed_after_ms`): it catches a revert on the microtask queue, in `setTimeout(0)` or in an
animation frame, not a validator that clears the field at 400 ms — for that, `wait` then
`assert value`. Canvas, WebGL and CSS-only effects are invisible to the accessibility tree: a
class, an opacity, a transform, a repaint all look like `unchanged` or `no_effect`, so confirm
with `screenshot` or `eval`, never with a second click.

## Workflow: inspect → act → assert

```bash
chrome-agent goto https://app.com/login --inspect   # uids
chrome-agent fill --uid n52 "user@test.com"         # value: what the page kept
chrome-agent click n63                              # verdict + delivery + next
chrome-agent assert text --contains "Dashboard"     # exit 0 = evidence you may quote
```

Re-inspect when `verdict` is `navigated`, when `next` says `inspect`, and after any SPA route
change (`back`, `forward`, a click that re-renders) — uids are reassigned. For an SPA detail page
prefer `goto <direct-url>` over `click`, which may open a modal.

## `assert`: the exit code is the answer

Prove the end state before reporting a task complete. Exit 0 is the only evidence you may quote.

```bash
chrome-agent assert value --selector "#email" --equals "ada@example.com"
chrome-agent assert text --selector "#status" --contains "Shipped"
chrome-agent assert url --matches "/orders/[0-9]+$"
chrome-agent assert state --selector "#terms" --checked        # native OR aria-checked
chrome-agent assert state --uid n15 --selected "California"    # a dropdown's current option
chrome-agent assert state --selector "#submit" --disabled      # :disabled OR aria-disabled
chrome-agent assert state --selector ".modal" --visible        # rendered, opaque, not hidden
chrome-agent assert exists --selector ".result" --count 10     # --min N, or --count 0 for absence
chrome-agent assert value --selector "#quantity" --equals "1" --within 5
```

Use `--within N` for a delayed result (positive whole seconds); assertions otherwise check once.
Only reads repeat, and the first matching observation succeeds. This does not prove stability.
JSON adds `assertion.wait`: `within_ms`, `elapsed_ms`, `observations`, `timed_out`. Expiry is exit 2
with the last comparison. Unreadable targets, blocked reads and connection loss stay exit 1,
with `error`, `wait` and optional `last_observation`. A missing value/text/state target is still
an error; wait for presence with `assert exists --within N` first. Pipe and macros accept
`"within":5` on the assertion command. The window bounds the entire read; `--timeout` continues
to cap individual CDP calls.

- **0** it held · **2** the condition did not hold (report or repair) · **1** the check could not
  finish: no browser, a selector matching nothing, an unparseable regex, a CDP timeout.
  A `macro run` guard or a `discover step` assertion that did not hold also exits 2.
  A bad flag exits 1. Inside `pipe`/`batch` an assertion has no exit
  code of its own: it is `ok:false` with the same `assertion` object, and a `batch` that stopped
  on it exits 1, not 2.
- `assert` is a read: no change report, no verdict, and it never clicks. Secrets are compared but
  never printed (the response gives both lengths). `--checked` reads the same classification
  `check`/`uncheck` apply and `--selected` the same reading `select` uses, so an assertion cannot
  disagree with the action.
- `--matches` is a Rust regex: `\d` `\w` `\s` are ASCII-only, no `\p{...}`, no lookaround; `(?i)`
  for case-insensitive. `--contains` is a plain case-sensitive substring.

**Targeting** has three modes: **uid** (from `inspect`, e.g. `n47`, stable across inspects of the
same page), **`--selector`** (CSS), **`--xy`** (coordinates). Every targeted action returns the
`uid` it actually resolved, even when you aimed with `--selector` — cross-check it against `delta`.
`click --selector` is the same verb as `click <uid>`: both resolve the viewport centre and dispatch
native input, so a `--selector` on a button behind a cookie banner clicks the banner. That is what
a pointer does, and what `intercepted_by` tells you.

```

**Macros.** `macro record <name> --from-recording <file>` (or
`{"cmd":"macro","action":"record","name":"x"}` inside the pipe session that just did it) distils
actions, waits, assertions, reads, downloads and supported context. Discovery snapshots, diffs
and history are dropped. Failed or undelivered steps and unsupported locators refuse the whole
recording without saving or replacing a macro. Derived guards are `delivery: target_hit`,
`verdict: changed|navigated`, `verbatim: true`, `downloaded: true` and `url_matches` on the path. A step aimed by uid is recorded by role + accessible name, or refused. A secret field
becomes a declared parameter and is never stored, so `macro run` refuses without `--var`. A guard
that does not hold **stops** the run, naming the step index, the guard, what was observed and the
action's own `next`, and exits **2** with `stopped_by: "guard"` — the same code as a failed
assertion, because it is the same kind of claim. A run that stopped for any other reason (the step
failed, the page could not be read, no such macro) exits **1** with `stopped_by: "error"`. Steps
that could promise nothing are marked `unguarded` and counted in both reports — read that number
before trusting a green run. Explicit assertions and waits count as checks.

`macro check` prepares all commands, parameters and guards offline; `macro run` uses the same
preparation before any action. Repeat `--var` for multiple inputs; commas remain part of a value.
Substitution visits string values in commands and guards once. CSS, JavaScript and live-page
conditions are checked during replay. Use `--json` to retrieve each completed `steps[].result` and
the stopped step's `result`, including data, assertion evidence and download paths. Declared secret
inputs are redacted. Task success requires explicit outcome assertions supplied by the caller.

## Discovery that survives a new conversation

Use `discover` when exploring an unfamiliar task and another process may need to continue.
You supply the reasoning; the CLI persists the objective, hypotheses, unknowns and command
responses. It does not infer task completion from a successful browser command.

```bash
chrome-agent --json discover start discovery.json --goal "Read the entry page" --url https://example.com --max-commands 10
chrome-agent --json discover step discovery.json --proposal '{"id":"open","revision":0,"reason":"Observe the entry page","command":{"cmd":"goto","url":"https://example.com"},"checks":[{"cmd":"assert","what":"exists","selector":"h1"}]}'
chrome-agent --json discover show discovery.json
chrome-agent --json discover export discovery.json --name entry-page --steps open
```

Use the returned revision for your next proposal and the browser/page names supplied at start.
Identical proposals with the same ID retrieve earlier receipts (`replayed:true`); changed
proposals under that ID are refused. A process loss leaves a pending experiment whose outcome
is uncertain. Read the record and submit a new observation; do not blindly repeat the old step.

The initial profile permits same-origin `goto`, `inspect`, `read`, `text`, `extract`, `assert`
and `wait`. The first experiment must navigate to the entry URL. Defaults: 50 commands and
1,800 seconds including time between calls. Checks and failed or unresolved attempts consume
budget. Responses above 64 KiB stop with uncertainty; narrow the next read. The file contains
raw inputs and observations and stays local. Site JavaScript can still cause external effects;
this command profile is not a sandbox for untrusted recipes.

Export selects successful experiments in order, requires a starting navigation and final
assertion, refuses document uids, and creates a new macro name. It preserves parameter templates
without input defaults. The candidate still needs fresh-input replay and independent result
checks. Legacy `macro run` does not enforce discovery origin or budgets. `discover step` exits
0 for observed commands/checks, 2 for an assertion that did not hold, and 1 for error or
uncertainty. `start`, `show` and `export` never open Chrome.

## Global flags

Accepted on **either side of the verb**. Two exceptions: `--timeout` and `--max-depth`. A command
that declares its own takes it after the verb (`wait selector ".x" --timeout 5`); everywhere else
they must come before it. Passing one where it is not declared is an exit-1 usage error naming
the invocation that works.

```bash
--stealth          # 7 anti-detection CDP patches
--json             # structured JSON on stdout; errors exit 1 with {"ok":false,...} still on stdout
--browser <name>   # isolate parallel agents — sharing "default" corrupts sessions
--page <name>      # named tabs
--max-depth N      # limit inspect tree depth
--verdict MODE     # auto (default): report what changed. off: report the action only
--budget N         # cap the change report, in chars (default 1200; 0 = uncapped)
--on-intercept M   # dispatch (default) | guard | refuse
--timeout N        # deadline on every CDP call (default 30s)
--headed           # show the window
--connect URL      # attach to a real Chrome (DataDome/Kasada)
--proxy-server URL # http(s)/socks4/5://host:port; launch-only
--copy-cookies     # use cookies from your real Chrome profile
--chrome-arg FLAG  # extra flag for the launched Chrome (repeatable); launch-only
--dialog MODE      # accept (default) | dismiss | manual · --dialog-text for prompt()
```

`--chrome-arg` applies only when chrome-agent launches Chrome (refused, not ignored, under
`--connect`) and is fixed for the life of a named browser — close or purge it to change them.
Refused outright: `--user-data-dir`, `--remote-debugging-port`, `--remote-debugging-pipe`,
`--proxy-server` (use the global one), `--headless` (use `--headed`).

Exit codes: **0** success · **1** error (including a bad flag, and a `batch --stop-on-error` that
stopped) · **2** an assertion (including `discover step`) or a `macro run` guard did not hold ·
**130** Ctrl+C. JS dialogs auto-accept so the page never hangs.

### Bot protection

| Site protection | Solution | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| None | `chrome-agent goto ...` | — |
| Cloudflare **JS challenge** ("Just a moment…") | `chrome-agent --stealth goto ...` | `shop.app`: 403 / 6 nodes without, 200 / real page with |
| Cloudflare **managed Turnstile** | `--stealth` does **not** get through | `nowsecure.nl`: 10 nodes with and without |
| Logged-in sites (X, Gmail) | `chrome-agent --stealth --copy-cookies goto ...` | — |
| DataDome/Kasada | `google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 &` then `chrome-agent --connect http://127.0.0.1:9222 goto ...` | `leboncoin.fr`: 403 with `--stealth` and without |

The two Cloudflare rows are different products: "Just a moment…" is a JS challenge the seven
patches satisfy, while a managed Turnstile fingerprints the browser and no in-binary patch moves
it. There, and for DataDome, `--connect` to a real Chrome is the only route. Read the page after
navigating rather than assuming the flag worked.

## Response shapes (`--json`)

```
Success: {"ok":true, ...}
Error:   {"ok":false, "error":"message", "hint":"what to do next"}
```

- `goto` → `{"url","title","landed":{"requested","final","redirected","http_status","serving","challenge_from"?}}`.
  Check `redirected`: an expired session bouncing to a login wall otherwise reads as a successful
  load. Fragment-only and trailing-slash differences are not redirects. `http_status` is the final
  hop's, absent (never 0) when the browser reports none. A redirect onto `/login`, `/signin`,
  `/auth`, `/sso` adds a `hint` guessed from the URL. `goto` carries no verdict.
- **`serving` is what answered, and it is the field to branch on.**

  | `serving` | means | do |
  |---|---|---|
  | `page` | nothing measured contradicts the load | proceed |
  | `challenge` | an anti-bot vendor's frame or script is here and the site has no form of its own; `challenge_from` names the vendor host | `--connect` to a real Chrome — `--stealth` does not defeat these |
  | `error` | the server answered 4xx/5xx; read `http_status` | fix the URL (404), authenticate (401/403), or wait (429/5xx) |
  | `nothing_actionable` | no link, no form control, no script, almost no text | `inspect` before giving up |
  | `unreadable` | the shape probe did not run | `inspect` |

  `page` is the absence of evidence, not a certificate: a paywall, a cookie wall and an unknown
  captcha vendor all read as `page`. `nothing_actionable` is a measurement, not a claim you were
  blocked — an edge-served refusal and a page that had not finished rendering look identical.
- `click`/`fill`/`select`/`check`/… → `{"message", "uid", "verdict", "verdict_reason", "next",
  "verdict_hint"?, "changed":{"added","removed","changed","unchanged","moved","anonymous",
  "document_changed","identity_known"}, "delta":"+ uid=n88 heading \"Saved\""}`, plus
  `"focus":{"from","to"}` when focus moved (deliberately not counted as a content change).
- `fill` also → `"value":{"requested","actual","verbatim","observed_after_ms","caveat"?}`. A secret
  field (`type=password`, or `autocomplete` naming a password/card/CVC/one-time code) reports
  `{"redacted":true,"requested_length","actual_length","verbatim"}` instead. `caveat` when the
  write exceeded `maxlength`. `fill-form`/`fill_and_submit` → `"values":[...]`, one per field,
  redacted the same way; on `fill_and_submit` it is the only witness, since the change report runs
  after the form has moved on.
- `select` → `"value"` with the option TEXT; `check`/`uncheck` → `"value"` with
  `checked`/`unchecked` (`indeterminate` for a mixed native box). Both put `observed_after_ms` at
  the top level and both REFUSE (non-zero exit) when the page reverts inside the window. `value` is
  **absent** when the element already held the state — nothing was dispatched, so that response
  answers `no_baseline`/`identical_tree` and is no evidence this action changed anything.
- pointer-targeted actions → `"delivery"`, `"aim":[x,y]`, `"intercepted_by":{...}` when intercepted.
- `inspect --max-chars` → `{"total_chars","truncated","next_offset"}` · `read`/`text` → `{"text"}` ·
  `eval` → `{"result"}` · `network` → `{"requests":[...]}` · `console` → `{"messages":[...]}` ·
  `batch` → `{"results":[...]}` · `screenshot`/`pdf` → `{"path"}` ·
  `download <url>` → `{"via":"fetch","downloaded","path","bytes","mime"}`.
- `download --uid/--selector` clicks and captures the browser-native download — the only route to a
  file the page builds itself (`Blob`) or serves from a POST no anchor names. **Branch on
  `downloaded`, never on `ok`**: a click that landed and produced no file answers `ok:true` with
  `downloaded:false` and a hint forbidding the retry. `--timeout` bounds the whole window (begin
  AND finish); `--max-bytes` cancels past it and removes the partial file. Exactly one target — a
  URL, `--uid` or `--selector`; none or two is a usage error on stderr, exit 1, before a browser
  is resolved.

## Cheap reads: choose the right one

Reach for `extract` first on anything that looks like a list. Figures measured on the Hacker News
front page; they scale with the page, so treat them as relative.

| Tool | When | Tokens on HN |
|------|------|--------|
| `extract` | Repeating records: grids, feeds, tables, results. No selectors. | ~1,570 for all 30 |
| `read` | Articles, blog posts, product pages (Mozilla Readability) | ~950 |
| `text --selector "main"` | Scoped visible text | ~1,040 unscoped |
| `network --filter "api"` | The page fetched its data over XHR — take the payload | often the cleanest |
| `eval "JSON.stringify(...)"` | Attributes a record view doesn't carry | varies |
| `inspect --filter "button,link"` | Finding what to act on, not reading content | ~1,735 |
| `inspect` | Full tree with uids | ~5,650 |

`extract --scroll` scrolls and waits on a `MutationObserver` for lazy content; `extract --a11y`
works on React SPAs (X.com) where the DOM carries no stable structure.

Budget: prefer `inspect` over `screenshot` (a screenshot gives no uids, so you inspect anyway);
narrow with `--filter "button,link"`, `--max-depth 2`, `read --truncate 1000`,
`text --selector "main" --truncate 500`; `--budget N` caps the change report and `--verdict off`
removes the post-action read entirely, and every guarantee at the top of this file with it; use
`pipe`/`batch` for multi-step flows — one connection, uids stay valid, and about 12 ms of
per-command overhead goes away (measured 1.5x on a read stream, 1.1x on fills and clicks). Reach
for it for the stable uids, not for the speed.
