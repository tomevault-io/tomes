# Loop GitHub Issues

Run the autonomous loop to execute features from GitHub Issues.

## Usage

```
/loop-github-issues              # Interactive: shows available PRDs and asks which to run
/loop-github-issues --all        # Run all available PRDs (no prompt)
/loop-github-issues auth-flow    # Run PRDs matching search term
/loop-github-issues 25           # Run with 25 iterations per PRD
/loop-github-issues --all 25     # Run all PRDs with 25 iterations each
```

When running non-interactively (background mode), `--all` is auto-enabled.

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI authenticated
- PRD issues created via `/ralph-github-create-issues` (reads from `.claude/plans/` or `prds/`)

**Note:** Assume gh extensions are installed. Do NOT try to install them.

## Process

1. Check prerequisites (`gh auth status`)
2. Run the script directly - it handles PRD selection and filtering:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/loop-github-issues/loop-github-issues.sh [iterations] [prd-search-term] [--all]
```

Use `run_in_background: true` to prevent timeout.

**Monitoring progress:**
- Local status: `cat /tmp/ralph-status-{repo}-{prd-number}.txt`
- GitHub: Comments are posted to the PRD issue as stories complete

**Important**: Don't list PRDs separately before running - the script shows available PRDs (excluding those with open PRs) and handles selection.

### What It Does

1. Lists open PRD issues (identified by `prd` label) that don't already have open PRs
2. Prompts user to select which PRD(s) to work on (or auto-selects in background mode)
3. For each selected PRD:
   - Assigns issue to current user (shows as in progress)
   - Creates git worktree at `../{repo}-{feature}/`
   - For each iteration:
     - Passes all open sub-issues to the agent
     - Agent picks the logical next story based on dependencies
     - Implements the story
     - Commits: `feat: Story Title (closes #XXX)`
     - Closes sub-issue with link to commit
   - When all sub-issues closed, creates PR (parent PRD closes on merge)
   - Cleans up worktree

### Differences from `/ralph`

| Aspect | `/ralph` (JSON) | `/loop-github-issues` (GitHub) |
|--------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Story source | `prds/*.json` | GitHub Issues |
| Status tracking | `passes: true/false` | Issue open/closed |
| Dependencies | `dependsOn` array | Native GitHub blocking |
| Completion | Update JSON | Close issue |
| PRD done | All stories pass | All sub-issues closed |

### Dependencies

Ralph-issues checks GitHub's native blocking relationships. PRDs with open blocking issues are skipped.

The script queries the `blockedBy` field via GraphQL to determine if a PRD is ready to start.

## Issue Conventions

### Finding PRD Issues

```bash
gh issue list --label prd --state open --json number,title,body
```

### Finding Story Sub-Issues

Uses the `gh-sub-issue` extension:
```bash
gh sub-issue list <parent-number> --state open --json number,title,body
```

### Closing Issues

On story completion:
```bash
gh issue close 101 --comment "Implemented in https://github.com/owner/repo/commit/abc123"
```

Parent PRD issues close automatically when the PR is merged (via `Closes #XX` in PR body).

## Branch Naming

Uses conventional prefixes parsed from the PRD issue body:
- `feature/<name>` for enhancements
- `bugfix/<name>` for bug fixes

## Notes

- Run multiple Ralph instances in parallel on independent PRDs (separate terminals)
- Each works in its own worktree, no conflicts
- Commits include `closes #XXX` to auto-close issues on merge
