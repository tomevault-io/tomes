# Humanize

Review and edit copy to remove signs of AI-generated writing. Based on Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" guide maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup. Contains 30 rules across 6 categories.

## When to Apply

- Editing AI-generated drafts
- Reviewing text that sounds robotic or corporate
- Cleaning up writing before publishing
- Making technical content sound more natural

## Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

- Preserve meaning, factual claims, and intent.
- Preserve coverage: don't drop list items, options, or qualifiers (e.g., removing one option from a list) unless they're truly redundant.
- Do not add new facts, dates, quotes, or citations that are not already present or user-provided.
- Do not imply a source ("according to…") unless you can name it from the input.
- Keep genre and audience intact (e.g., neutral encyclopedic tone vs. personal essay). Use `voice-soul` only when that voice fits.
- Don't rewrite quoted material unless the user asked to rewrite the quote itself.
- Avoid em dashes (—). Replace with commas, periods, or parentheses.
- **Don't introduce new AI patterns.** Your rewrite must pass the same rules you're applying. Common traps: "Here's the thing:", "It's not about X, it's about Y", formulaic hooks that try to sound casual.

## Rule Categories

- `filler-conclusions` — Replace "the future looks bright" with specifics

### Voice (HIGH)

- `voice-soul` — Add personality, opinions, varied rhythm

## Scoring

Score text before and after rewriting to show improvement. The score measures how human the writing sounds.

### How it works

1. Start at 100
2. Subtract points for each violation found
3. HIGH impact violations (Content, Language, Communication, Voice): -3 points each
4. MEDIUM impact violations (Style, Filler): -1 point each
5. Minimum score is 0

### Score report format

```
Category       | Before | After | Notes
---------------|--------|-------|-------------------------------
Content        |     94 |   100 | 2 violations fixed
Language       |     88 |    97 | dual-adjectives, copula
Style          |     85 |   100 | 4 em dashes, tightened headers
Communication  |    100 |   100 | —
Filler         |     95 |   100 | "Here's the thing" removed
Voice          |     91 |    94 | rhythm, contractions
---------------|--------|-------|-------------------------------
Overall        |     84 |    97 |
```

### Interpreting scores

- **95-100**: Clean, sounds human
- **85-94**: Minor issues, mostly fine
- **70-84**: Noticeable AI patterns
- **Below 70**: Needs significant work

## Process

1. If `WRITING_STYLE_GUIDE_PATH` is set, load the writing style guide before processing
2. Load relevant rules from `references/`
3. Scan text for patterns and calculate before score
4. Rewrite problem sections
5. Add voice (see `voice-soul`)
6. **Self-check**: Scan your rewrite for the same AI patterns, calculate after score
7. Read aloud, it should sound like a person wrote it

## Output

Provide:
1. Score report (before → after with category breakdown)
2. The rewritten text
3. Brief summary of changes

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `WRITING_STYLE_GUIDE_PATH` | No | Path to shared writing style guide. Loaded before processing |
