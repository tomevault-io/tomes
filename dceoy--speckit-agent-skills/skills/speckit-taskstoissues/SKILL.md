# Spec Kit Tasks-to-Issues Skill

## When to Use

- You want to convert `tasks.md` into GitHub issues in the same repository.

## Inputs

- `specs/<feature>/tasks.md`
- The repository's Git remote URL
- Any user-provided issue labeling or grouping preferences

If tasks are missing, ask the user to run speckit-tasks first.

## Workflow

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").
1. From the executed script, extract the path to **tasks**.
1. Get the Git remote by running:

```bash
git config --get remote.origin.url
```

> [!CAUTION]
> ONLY PROCEED TO NEXT STEPS IF THE REMOTE IS A GITHUB URL

1. For each task in the list, create a new issue in the repository that matches the Git remote.
   - Prefer a GitHub issue-writing tool if available (e.g., MCP server or `gh issue create`).
   - Keep titles concise and include the task ID in the issue body for traceability.

> [!CAUTION]
> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EVER CREATE ISSUES IN REPOSITORIES THAT DO NOT MATCH THE REMOTE URL

## Outputs

- GitHub issues created from `tasks.md` (one per task), in the repository matching the Git remote
