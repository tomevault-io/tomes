## MCP Tool Delegation

This skill delegates to the `mcp__skillsmith` MCP server for all operations. When the user requests skill-related actions, use the appropriate MCP tool.

**Note:** The examples below show the tool parameters. Invoke these using Claude's standard MCP tool calling mechanism.

### Search for Skills

Use `mcp__skillsmith__search` with these parameters:
- `query` (optional): Search term
- `category` (optional): development, testing, devops, etc.
- `trust_tier` (optional): verified, community, experimental
- `min_score` (optional): Minimum quality score (0-100)
- `limit` (optional): Max results (default 10)

**Example:** Search for testing skills with quality score > 70
```json
{
  "query": "testing",
  "min_score": 70,
  "limit": 10
}
```

**Note:** Either `query` OR at least one filter (`category`, `trust_tier`, `min_score`) must be provided.

### Get Skill Details

Use `mcp__skillsmith__get_skill` with:
- `id` (required): Skill ID in format `author/name`

```json
{ "id": "community/jest-helper" }
```

### Install a Skill

Use `mcp__skillsmith__install_skill` with:
- `id` (required): Skill ID

```

### Uninstall a Skill

Use `mcp__skillsmith__uninstall_skill` with:

```

### Get Recommendations

Use `mcp__skillsmith__skill_recommend` with:
- `context` (optional): Project context
- `limit` (optional): Max recommendations

```json
{ "context": "React TypeScript project", "limit": 5 }
```

### Compare Skills

Use `mcp__skillsmith__skill_compare` with:
- `skill_ids` (required): Array of 2-5 skill IDs to compare

```json
{ "skill_ids": ["community/jest-helper", "community/vitest-helper"] }
```

### Validate a Skill

Use `mcp__skillsmith__skill_validate` with:
- `path` (required): Path to skill directory

```json
{ "path": "./my-skill" }
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Search and Install

   ```

### Example 2: Get Recommendations

   ```

3. Present recommendations with explanations

### Example 3: Compare Options

User: "Compare jest-helper and vitest-helper"

Use `mcp__skillsmith__skill_compare`:
```json

## Quality Scores

Quality scores (0-100) reflect skill quality based on:

- Repository health (stars, forks, activity)
- Documentation completeness
- Code quality indicators
- Community engagement

Recommended minimum scores:
- Production use: 70+
- General use: 50+
- Experimental: Any

## CLI Fallback

If the MCP server is unavailable, use the CLI directly:

```bash
# Search
skillsmith search "testing" --tier verified

# Install
skillsmith install community/jest-helper

# List installed
skillsmith list

# Remove
skillsmith remove jest-helper
```
