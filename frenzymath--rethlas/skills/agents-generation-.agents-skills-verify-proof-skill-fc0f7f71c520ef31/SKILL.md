# Verify Proof

Use the local proof verification service as the canonical verifier before accepting a solution.
Do not use this skill for partial proofs, isolated subgoals, or branches that have not yet produced a full proof draft of the whole problem.

## Input Contract

Read:

- target theorem statement
- assembled proof blueprint candidate from `results/{problem_id}/blueprint.md` as pure markdown text
- relevant prior failure reports and branch context

## Procedure

1. Read the current `results/{problem_id}/blueprint.md` draft as pure text.
2. First check that `blueprint.md` contains a full proof draft of the entire target theorem rather than a partial proof, fragment, or exploratory notes. If it does not, do not call the verifier yet.
3. Call MCP tool `verify_proof_service` with:
   - `statement`: target informal statement
   - `proof`: the raw markdown text from `blueprint.md`
4. Read `verification_report.summary`, `critical_errors`, `gaps`, `verdict`, and `repair_hints`.
5. Return and persist exactly what the verification service returns. Do not rename keys, add keys, or change the JSON structure.
6. Treat the proof as failed if any of the following hold:
   - `verdict` is `"wrong"`
   - `verification_report.critical_errors` is non-empty
   - `verification_report.gaps` is non-empty
7. Only treat the proof as passed when none of the failure conditions above hold.
8. If the proof passes, rename `results/{problem_id}/blueprint.md` to `results/{problem_id}/blueprint_verified.md`.

## Output Contract

Append to `verification_reports`:

```json
{
  "verification_report": {
    "summary": "string",
    "critical_errors": [
      {"location": "", "issue": "detailed description of the issue"}
    ],
    "gaps": [
      {"location": "", "issue": "detailed description of the gap"}
    ]
  },
  "verdict": "string",
  "repair_hints": "string"
}
```

Persist the verification service response exactly as returned.

If verification fails, revise `blueprint.md` directly and append to `failed_paths` when a branch is invalidated.

## MCP Tools

- `verify_proof_service`
- `memory_append`
- `memory_search`
- `branch_update`
- Codex built-in web search and `search_arxiv_theorems` when the verifier identifies a missing lemma or gap

## Failure Logging

Always persist verification output, including successful checks.
