# DKC1Recomp tool suite

This repo is a **static recompilation** of Donkey Kong Country (SNES, USA
v1.0) with **host-side widescreen presentation**. Everything here follows
one contract: game logic stays byte-for-byte stock; widescreen is
presentation only (margins, camera bias, wider object *visibility* — never
changed *simulation*). The supported ROM is headerless USA v1.0,
sha256 `fa8cacf5bbfc39ee6bbaa557adf89133d60d42f6cf9e1db30d5a36a469f74d15`
(never commit ROMs, save states, captures, or generated game code).

## ⚠ Do not confuse the two widescreen efforts

There were TWO widescreen projects. Only this repo is current:

| | **This repo (current)** | **Legacy emulator hack (reference only)** |
|---|---|---|
| Approach | Host-side presentation over stock logic | ROM patched with asar (game code modified) |
| Location | `C:\Users\ellio\Documents\GitHub\DKC1Recomp` | in-repo consolidated copy: `reference/legacy-widescreen/` (canonical for reading); originals at `D:\Downloads\DKLR\DKC-Widescreen-358x224\`, `D:\Downloads\DKLR\DKC_Widescreen_358x224*.sfc` (+398 variants, MSU1 builds), `reference/disassembly/DKC1/Custom\Patches\Widescreen_358x224.asm`, `RomMap\ROM_Map_HACK_*` |
| Use for | All new work | Prior-art reference: its worklog documents bug classes (OAM X-high wrap, exit-boundary coverage, section controllers) that inspired our detectors. **Never copy its code or compare its patched-ROM behavior as "stock".** |

If a file mentions `358x224`, asar patching, or lives under
`reference/legacy-widescreen/` or under `D:\Downloads\DKLR\` outside the
disassembly's clean sources, it is the legacy effort. (Careful: the
RECOMP host renders 342x224 / 398x224 — a `398x224` mention alone does
not mean legacy; `358x224` always does.)

## Repo map

- `runner/` — host + adapters (`dkc1_game.c` presentation glue,
  `win32_host.c` visible debugger, `headless_main.c`, detectors)
- `snesrecomp/` — engine submodule (**fork: elliotttate/snesrecomp**;
  `runner/src/snes/ws_shadow.c` is the widescreen margin cache)
- `recomp/*.cfg` — recompiler configs incl. **dispatch contracts**
  (runtime-proven indirect-call target sets). Fixes for
  recompilation-correctness bugs go HERE, then regenerate.
- `generated/` — machine-emitted game C. **Never hand-edit or commit.**
- `tools/` — the analysis/verification suite (see `TOOLS.md` here)
- `recipes/*.dks` — deterministic input routes; `contracts/*.json` —
  regression contracts; `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.json` + `docs/DASHBOARD.md`
- Build: `build_host_tools.bat` (isolated tool-session build →
  `build/dkc1_headless_tools.exe`, `dkc1_desktop_tools.exe`,
  `dkc1_layer_capture.exe`), `build_host.bat` (primary),
  `build_host_noadapt.bat` (no-widescreen-adapter oracle). All embed build
  identity (git commit shown in window title / state sidecars).

## Where fixes go (never into decompiled/generated code)

1. **Presentation/widescreen bug** → `ws_shadow.c`, `dkc1_game.c`/
   `dkc1_video.c` adapters, or the hosts.
2. **Recomp-correctness bug** (wrong dispatch, miscompile) →
   `recomp/*.cfg`, regenerate.
3. To understand intent, use the knowledge sources via
   **`python tools/atlas.py <addr|7Exxxx|name:term>`** — one query joins
   IDA's curated names/descriptions, disassembly+pseudocode listing, the
   live recompiled variant, dispatch contracts, WRAM labels, and
   known-issue mentions. Debug output (verdicts, click reports, trace PCs)
   pastes straight in.

## Evidence discipline (non-negotiable)

- Detectors/taps are **default-off** (env-gated); arming one must never
  change emulation (A/B hash-identical).
- Watch **transitions, not dumps**; match actors by **source record
  ($15FD)**, never by mutable pool slot.
- Routes are **predicate-driven** (`wait`/`pulse` on WRAM), resolved to
  fixed input schedules before differential comparison.
- A fix is verified only by **3× byte-identical replays** including
  end-of-run framebuffer/audio hashes (`tools/run_regression.py` enforces
  this plus ratcheted integrity budgets).
- Event flags like `$1595` are consumed same-frame — end-of-frame WRAM
  dumps cannot see them; watch durable effects (state, timers) instead.
- WRAM semantics: see `tools/atlas.py wram:<addr>`; key addresses are in
  `TOOLS.md`.

## Typical workflows

**Widescreen bug of ANY kind:** start at
**`docs/WIDESCREEN_PLAYBOOK.md`** — the symptom-first decision guide:
five entry points, the eight-rung localization ladder (pixel →
provenance → layers → policy → stock-vs-wide → reverse_watch →
atlas/irview/slice → oracle), the verdict/detector → owner table for
every invariant-monitor verdict, fix-ownership routing incl.
DKC1_REPLACE, the full verification ladder, and worked examples from
docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.json.

**"Something looks wrong on screen" (visible host):** click the pixel —
the panel reports world coord, tile, provenance, last writer, OAM entries,
nearest actor. F9 exports a repro bundle (rolling inputs + states + memory
+ auto layer-isolation captures). With `DKC1_AUTO_EXPORT=1` +
`DKC1_FLIGHT_RECORDER=1`, any integrity detector exports automatically and
appends a post-failure tail.

**Reproduce + diagnose headlessly:** run a recipe with taps armed, e.g.
`DKC1_WIDESCREEN=1 DKC1_SCRIPT=recipes/route_jungle.dks DKC1_WS_TRACE=t.jsonl
build\dkc1_headless_tools.exe <rom> 9000`, then the matching analyzer
(`analyze_ws_trace.py`, `lifecycle_by_source.py`, `analyze_retrodiction.py`…).

**Gate a fix:** `python tools/run_regression.py contracts/jungle-entry.json
--exe build/dkc1_headless_tools.exe --rom <rom> --json-out
build/regression/results.json`, then `python tools/make_dashboard.py`.
Sweep everything: `python tools/level_sweep.py --rom <rom>`.

**Pin a new bug:** add it to `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.json` with a repro; ratchet
its detector count in the contract `budgets`; tighten to 0 when fixed.

Full catalog of all 47 tools, every env var, route DSL, and debug keys:
**`TOOLS.md` in this folder.**

For battery/in-game saves, use `verify_ingame_saves.py` and
`docs/INGAME_SAVES.md`. Desktop hosts now persist SRAM: isolate their user
directory (SDL: `DKC1_USER_DIR`; legacy Win32: working directory). Headless
tests retain explicit SRAM input and never implicitly update a battery file.

For the native iPhone/iPad frontend, read `docs/IOS.md`. `build_ios.sh` builds
the app; `tools/verify_ios_simulator.py` compares three runs of the existing
headless runner inside the simulator app against three desktop runs.
`DKC1_IOS_DIAGNOSTICS` is a default-off build option. Mobile landscape chooses
a bounded native source width (418 on the connected phone) with fixed SNES
pixel proportions. Read `docs/IOS.md` for the limited validated scene scope.
The same default-off diagnostic build supports `--verify-graphics`, reusing
the native Metal output/cache oracle, plus paused upscale-preview captures.
See `TOOLS.md` for source-frame inputs, output hashes and UI probe limits.
