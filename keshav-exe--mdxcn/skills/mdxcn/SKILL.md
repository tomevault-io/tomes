# mdxcn

Glyphs in a dashed frame with `+` corners and a `[ TITLE ]` on the top edge.

Pick the host before you write — the paste format depends on it.

| Host                                                      | What to paste          | Where to copy from                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Notion, Linear, Google Docs, any rich text editor         | Fenced ASCII drawing   | docs **MDX** tab (the framed figure, not the inner list)                         |
| React, or MDX that can register the parent once           | Markdown, wrapped      | docs **React** tab inside `<GraphTree>` / `<Callout>` / … after `mdx-components.tsx` |
| Comark app (plain `.md` the app renders)                  | `::graph-*` + YAML     | https://mdxcn.dev/llms.txt `## Comark`, or the docs page **Comark** tab |
| Knap template (data → Markdown)                           | `graph_*` filter       | https://mdxcn.dev/llms.txt `## Knap`, or the docs page **Knap** tab     |
| README, GitHub, Slack, PR comments                        | Fenced ASCII           | docs **MDX** tab, or https://mdxcn.dev/llms.txt `## MDX`                |

Do not paste `<GraphTree>` into Notion — paste the fenced drawing from the MDX tab. Do not paste `::graph-*` into GitHub or Linear — they do not run Comark. Do not invent ASCII art — copy the official fence, swap labels, keep the frame. Knap filters emit that fence (or `::graph-*` when the param is `comark`).

No fenced ASCII: Flow, Plot, Activity, Heatmap, Calendar, Timer, Countdown, Frame. On GitHub, pick a graph that has fenced ASCII, or skip. On Comark, those graphs still work except Frame. On Knap they emit `::graph-*` YAML except Frame.

Source is copied via shadcn, not npm. Imports land under `@/registry/default`. Unsure of props? Fetch https://mdxcn.dev/llms.txt.

If `registry/default/graph-frame` is missing and the host is React, Comark, or Knap:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://mdxcn.dev/r/all.json
```

Need `motion`. One component: replace `all` with the slug (`graph-flow`, …). For Comark, the adapter is `graph-comark` (already in `all.json`). For Knap, the filters are `graph-knap` (already in `all.json`). Also `pnpm add knap`.

## Procedure

1. Decide if a figure earns it. One sentence → no graph. A path, a night, a matrix, a diff → yes.
2. Pick **at most two** graphs from the chooser. Prefer a pair in recipes.md. If the host is GitHub / README, drop any pick that has no fenced ASCII.
3. Copy. Framed ASCII from the docs MDX tab for Notion, Linear, README, GitHub. React from the docs React tab for MDX that can register the parent. `::graph-*` from llms.txt `## Comark`. `{{ … | graph_* }}` from llms.txt `## Knap`. Swap labels, keep the API / frame.
4. Write the reply in this shape. Do not lead with the figure.

React / importable MDX (register the parent once, paste the markdown inside):

```
1–3 sentences (the claim)

<GraphTimeline title="NIGHT">

- 14:02: p95 crossed 800ms
- **14:11: rolled back the cache flag**
- *14:40: write the postmortem*

</GraphTimeline>

1–3 sentences (what the second figure adds)
```

Notion / Linear / README (fenced ASCII from the docs MDX tab):

5. Check the rules. Then send.

## Chooser

Writing first. Data shape if nothing matches.

Skip `GraphFrame` unless you are assembling a custom figure. If the chart already exists, install that one.

## Import

```tsx
import { GraphFlow } from "@/registry/default/graph-flow/graph-flow"
```

Named export matches the folder: `graph-<name>/graph-<name>`. Do not invent a barrel. Skip this when the host is Comark, Knap, or plain Markdown.

Comark wiring (once per app, after `all.json`):

```tsx
import { graphComponents } from "@/registry/default/graph-comark/graph-comark"
```

Pass `graphComponents` to Comark's `components` prop.

Knap wiring (once per app, after `all.json`):

```tsx
import { createEngine, standardFilters } from "knap"
import { graphFilters } from "@/registry/default/graph-knap/graph-knap"

const engine = createEngine({
  filters: { ...standardFilters, ...graphFilters },
})
```

The Knap CLI does not load these filters.

Subset (only some graphs copied):

```tsx
import { createGraphComponents } from "@/registry/default/graph-comark/graph-comark"
import { GraphTable } from "@/registry/default/graph-table/graph-table"

const graphComponents = createGraphComponents({
  "graph-table": GraphTable,
})
```

```ts
import { createGraphFilters } from "@/registry/default/graph-knap/graph-knap"

const graphFilters = createGraphFilters(["graph_table", "graph_timeline"])
```

## Rules

- At most two graphs in a section. Prose between them. Never a gallery.
- Titles: 1–2 words, uppercase, no punctuation. Drawn as `[ TITLE ]`.
- Labels: lowercase, plain (`auth middleware`, not `AuthMiddleware Layer`).
- Copy props / fences / `::graph-*` blocks / `graph_*` filters from recipes.md, docs, or llms.txt. Do not invent APIs, extra hues, or chart libraries.
- Default palette is one accent (`--graph-accent`). `palette="duo"` / `"multi"` only when a second or third series needs it.
- Unused rows recede (~0.4 opacity). Numbers: `tabular-nums`, right-aligned.
- Motion is already in the components (transform + opacity, ~220ms). Do not add loops, pulses, or CSS animation.

## Do not

- Draw SVG, Mermaid, Recharts, or canvas.
- Invent ASCII art. Copy the official fence from llms.txt / the MDX tab.
- Paste JSX into README, GitHub, Linear, or any file that cannot import the components.
- Paste `::graph-*` into GitHub, Linear, or a README. Those hosts get the fenced ASCII.
- Restyle the frame (no extra borders, no rounded cards, no new corner marks).
- Dump every graph you know into one reply.
- Use a pie chart. Stack or Waffle.
- Pass `palette` on Table, Sheet, Invoice, Spec, Stat, Tree, or Frame.

## Example prompts

These are user messages. Match the pair. React → copy JSX from the recipe. Comark → copy the `::graph-*` block from llms.txt `## Comark`. Knap → copy the `graph_*` filter from llms.txt `## Knap`. GitHub / README → copy the fence from llms.txt.

**Refactor** → `GraphFlow`, then `GraphTimeline` (GitHub: Timeline only — Flow has no fenced ASCII)

```
We're moving session checks out of route handlers into middleware. Write a short plan for the team.

Use mdxcn for the before/after request path and the week-by-week rollout. Prose between the two figures. Don't draw SVG.
```

**Incident** → `GraphTimeline`, then `GraphUptime`

```
Draft a tight postmortem: p95 crossed 800ms at 14:02, we rolled back the cache flag at 14:11, the write-up is still open.

Use mdxcn — a timeline of the night, then which days users felt it. No SVG.
```

**Comark postmortem** → `::graph-timeline`, then `::graph-uptime`

```
Write this postmortem as a Comark Markdown file. p95 crossed 800ms at 14:02, rollback at 14:11.

Use ::graph-* blocks with YAML props. At most two figures. Don't paste JSX. Don't draw SVG.
```

**Knap postmortem** → `{{ events | graph_timeline }}`, then `{{ uptime | graph_uptime }}`

```
Write a Knap template for this postmortem. p95 crossed 800ms at 14:02, rollback at 14:11.

Pipe the graph props through graph_* filters so the output is the official fenced ASCII. At most two figures. Don't paste JSX. Don't draw SVG.
```

**Pull request** → `GraphDiff`, then `GraphSlope`

```
Leave a PR review comment on the auth refactor. Summarize what files moved, then show how coverage changed on main vs this branch.

Use mdxcn from this project. At most two figures. Don't invent APIs or draw SVG.
```

**Pick one** → `GraphCompare`, then `GraphRank` if install size is part of the argument

```
We're choosing a queue: BullMQ vs SQS. Write the tradeoff for the RFC.

Use mdxcn — a feature matrix, then bundle size only if it matters. Don't draw SVG.
```

**README** → fenced ASCIIs, not JSX, not `::graph-*`

```
Add a launch section to the README. It's a .md file, no React, no Comark.

Use mdxcn — a punch list (GraphCheck fence) and a grouped table if it earns it. Paste the official fenced ASCII from llms.txt. Don't paste JSX.
```
