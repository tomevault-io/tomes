# Apple Notes

Manage Apple Notes on macOS via AppleScript.

## Commands

Execute all commands via `osascript`:

```bash
osascript -e 'APPLESCRIPT_COMMAND'
```

## List All Notes

```bash
osascript << 'EOF'
tell application "Notes"
    set noteList to {}
    set allNotes to notes
    repeat with n in allNotes
        set noteTitle to name of n
        set noteId to id of n
        set end of noteList to noteTitle & " | ID: " & noteId
    end repeat
    return noteList as string
end tell
EOF
```

## List Notes with Preview

```bash
osascript << 'EOF'
tell application "Notes"
    set output to ""
    set allNotes to notes
    repeat with n in allNotes
        set noteTitle to name of n
        set noteBody to body of n
        set bodyLen to length of noteBody
        if bodyLen > 100 then set bodyLen to 100
        set bodyPreview to text 1 thru bodyLen of noteBody
        set output to output & "标题: " & noteTitle & linefeed & "ID: " & (id of n) & linefeed & "预览: " & bodyPreview & linefeed & "---" & linefeed
    end repeat
    return output
end tell
EOF
```

## Create Note

```bash
osascript << 'EOF'
tell application "Notes"
    set newNote to make new note with properties {name:"NOTE_TITLE", body:"NOTE_CONTENT"}
    return "Created: " & name of newNote & " | ID: " & id of newNote
end tell
EOF
```

## Create Note in Specific Folder

```bash
osascript << 'EOF'
tell application "Notes"
    tell folder "FOLDER_NAME"
        set newNote to make new note with properties {name:"NOTE_TITLE", body:"NOTE_CONTENT"}
        return "Created: " & name of newNote
    end tell
end tell
EOF
```

## Search Notes

```bash
osascript << 'EOF'
tell application "Notes"
    set searchQuery to "SEARCH_TERM"
    set foundNotes to {}
    set allNotes to notes
    repeat with n in allNotes
        set noteTitle to name of n
        set noteBody to body of n
        if noteTitle contains searchQuery or noteBody contains searchQuery then
            set end of foundNotes to noteTitle & " | ID: " & (id of n)
        end if
    end repeat
    return foundNotes as string
end tell
EOF
```

## Get Note Content

```bash
osascript << 'EOF'
tell application "Notes"
    set targetNote to first note whose name is "NOTE_TITLE"
    return "Title: " & name of targetNote & linefeed & "Body: " & body of targetNote
end tell
EOF
```

## Delete Note

```bash
osascript << 'EOF'
tell application "Notes"
    set targetNote to first note whose name is "NOTE_TITLE"
    delete targetNote
    return "Note deleted"
end tell
EOF
```

## List Folders

```bash
osascript -e 'tell application "Notes" to get name of every folder'
```

## Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `Can't get note` | Note not found | Use exact title match or search first |
| Permission denied | Automation not granted | Grant in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Automation |
| Timeout on list | Too many notes | Use pagination or filter by folder |

## Body Format

Note body is HTML. Example:

```
<div>Note content here</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Second paragraph</div>
```

## Requirements

- macOS with Apple Notes
- Automation permission for Terminal

## Note

The `memo` CLI tool is optional. AppleScript provides full functionality without additional installation.
