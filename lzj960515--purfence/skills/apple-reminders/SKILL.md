# Apple Reminders

Manage Apple Reminders via AppleScript (always available) or `remindctl` CLI (if installed).

## Method Selection

- **AppleScript**: Always available, no dependencies
- **remindctl CLI**: Better output formatting, requires `brew install steipete/tap/remindctl`

## Permissions

Grant access in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Reminders**. Terminal or the running app needs Reminders permission.

---

## AppleScript Commands (Recommended)

### List All Reminder Lists

```bash
osascript -e 'tell application "Reminders" to get name of lists'
```

Returns list names.

### List Reminders in a List

```bash
osascript -e '
tell application "Reminders"
    tell list "提醒"
        get {name, completed, due date} of every reminder
    end tell
end tell
'
```

### Create Reminder

```bash
osascript -e '
tell application "Reminders"
    tell list 1
        make new reminder with properties {name:"Task Title", body:"Optional notes"}
    end tell
end tell
'
```

Returns reminder ID: `reminder id x-apple-reminder://AEEE72F6-9A8E-4FEF-A55F-FA711397E5CA`

**Reminder properties:**
- `name`: Task title (string, required)
- `body`: Notes/description (string, optional)
- `due date`: Due date (date object, optional)
- `priority`: 0=none, 1=low, 5=medium, 9=high

### Create Reminder with Due Date

```bash
osascript -e '
tell application "Reminders"
    tell list "提醒"
        set tomorrow to (current date) + 1 * days
        make new reminder with properties {name:"Due tomorrow", due date:tomorrow}
    end tell
end tell
'
```

### Complete a Reminder

```bash
osascript -e '
tell application "Reminders"
    tell list "提醒"
        set theReminder to reminder id "x-apple-reminder://AEEE72F6-9A8E-4FEF-A55F-FA711397E5CA"
        set completed of theReminder to true
    end tell
end tell
'
```

### Delete a Reminder

```bash
osascript -e '
tell application "Reminders"
    tell list "提醒"
        delete reminder id "x-apple-reminder://AEEE72F6-9A8E-4FEF-A55F-FA711397E5CA"
    end tell
end tell
'
```

## remindctl CLI (Alternative)

If `remindctl` is installed, it provides cleaner output.

### Setup

```bash
brew install steipete/tap/remindctl
```

Check permissions: `remindctl status`

### View Reminders

```bash
remindctl              # Today
remindctl today        # Today
remindctl tomorrow     # Tomorrow
remindctl week         # This week
remindctl overdue      # Overdue
remindctl all          # All
```

### Manage Lists

```bash
remindctl list                    # List all lists
remindctl list Work               # Show list
remindctl list Projects --create  # Create
remindctl list Work --delete      # Delete
```

### Create & Complete

```bash
remindctl add "Buy milk"
remindctl add --title "Call mom" --list Personal --due tomorrow
remindctl complete 1 2 3
remindctl delete 4A83 --force
```

### Output Formats

```bash
remindctl today --json    # JSON
remindctl today --plain   # TSV
remindctl today --quiet   # Counts only
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use `list 1` for default list**: Avoids hardcoding list names
2. **Check list exists**: Some accounts may have different default list names
3. **AppleScript for reliability**: Works even without remindctl installed
4. **remindctl for scripting**: Use `--json` for parseable output

## Common Errors

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `Reminders got an error` | Check list name exists |
| `Not authorized` | Grant Reminders access in System Settings |
| `Can't get list` | List name doesn't exist; list lists first |

## Example: Create Reminder with Priority

```bash
osascript -e '
tell application "Reminders"
    tell list "提醒"
        set tomorrow to (current date) + 1 * days
        set hours of tomorrow to 9
        set minutes of tomorrow to 0
        make new reminder with properties {name:"Important meeting", body:"Prepare slides", due date:tomorrow, priority:9}
    end tell
end tell
'
```
