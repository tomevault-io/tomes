# Encephalon

Use Encephalon as the repository's durable, append-only memory. Query it before relying on assumptions; update it only when future agents would materially benefit.

## Start with active knowledge

Before planning or changing unfamiliar repository behaviour, search for the relevant subject:

```bash
npx --no-install encephalon search --compact "authentication deployment"
npx --no-install encephalon show --id "<relevant-id>" --active-only
```

Prefer compact search or one batched `gather` call before loading full records. Treat missing results as missing stored knowledge, not proof that a fact is false. Do not inspect or edit record JSON directly.

Search terms are literal and combined with AND. Payload-only matches can have a metadata/summary fallback snippet; use `show` to understand them. Reads prepare the disposable cache automatically. Recoverable corruption rebuilds once; a foreign cache or unsafe layout fails closed. Follow the reported recovery action rather than deleting cache or canonical files blindly. An add error with `canonicalCommitted: true` means the record already exists: inspect its ID and validate before retrying.

## Decide whether to record

Record only durable, high-signal knowledge:

- decisions and their rationale;
- architecture, boundaries, and conventions;
- repeatable development, release, or operational workflows;
- incidents with lasting diagnosis or prevention guidance;
- material technical or pull-request changes that reverse or invalidate prior knowledge;
- stable repository context that cannot be cheaply rediscovered.

Do not record routine edits, status updates, chat or log dumps, temporary debugging state, speculative ideas, source-code summaries, generated output, secrets, credentials, personal data, or local absolute paths.

## Preserve append-only history

Search the intended subject first. If active knowledge changes, add a replacement that supersedes every active head for the same `kind` and `subject`; never rewrite or delete the earlier record.

```bash
npx --no-install encephalon search --compact "api authentication strategy"
npx --no-install encephalon add \
  --kind decision \
  --subject api.authentication \
  --source agent \
  --supersedes "<active-id>" \
  --data '{"summary":"Use signed bearer tokens","rationale":["Supports non-browser clients"],"consequences":["Deploy token verification before clients"]}' \
  --text "authentication bearer token deployment"
npx --no-install encephalon validate
```

Use a recommended kind (`decision`, `architecture`, `convention`, `workflow`, `incident`, or `context`) when it fits. Keep subjects stable and payloads concise, structured, factual, and portable. Use `--artifact` only for an existing immutable supporting file beneath `_artifacts/<kind>/<id>/`; choose `--id` first when creating artifacts before their record.

Include new records and artifacts with the Git change that made them true. Do not stage, commit, push, or open a pull request automatically.

## Enrich an initial baseline

After `encephalon init`, read the active generated baseline and inspect the repository semantically. Add only durable facts the safe scanner could not derive, such as architectural boundaries, non-obvious conventions, and the reasons behind essential workflows. Do not restate manifests, script keys, or filenames already captured by the generated records. Init does not traverse source directories or generate language counts or file totals; discover languages or frameworks separately when the task needs them.

## Finish

Run:

```bash
npx --no-install encephalon validate
```

Resolve validation failures before presenting the related change. Mention the added or superseded record IDs in the handoff so the user can review them with the code.
