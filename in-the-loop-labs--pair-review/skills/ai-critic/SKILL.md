# AI Critic

Fetch AI-generated suggestions from pair-review and make code changes to address the valid ones.

## Determine review context

Determine whether this is a local review or a PR review:

1. If the user explicitly says "local", use local mode.
2. Otherwise, determine the GitHub owner, repo, and PR number for the current branch. If a PR exists, use PR mode with `repo` and `prNumber` params.
3. If no PR exists, use local mode with `path` (absolute cwd) and `headSha` (`git rev-parse HEAD`) params.

## Fetch AI suggestions

Call `mcp__pair-review__get_ai_suggestions` with the review context params. This returns suggestions from the latest analysis run by default.

If the user wants suggestions from a specific analysis run, call `mcp__pair-review__get_ai_analysis_runs` first to list available runs, then pass the appropriate `runId` to `get_ai_suggestions`.

Only active and adopted suggestions are included (dismissed ones are excluded).

If no suggestions are returned, tell the user there are no AI suggestions to address.

## Triage and address suggestions

AI suggestions are not human-curated — apply judgment. For each suggestion:

1. Read the file at the referenced path and lines.
2. Evaluate the suggestion: is it a real issue, a false positive, or a stylistic preference?
3. If the suggestion is valid and actionable, make the code change.
4. If the suggestion is a false positive or not worth addressing, skip it and note why.

Use the `ai_confidence` field as a signal but not a hard threshold — low-confidence suggestions can still be valid.

## Report

After processing all suggestions, provide a summary:
- How many suggestions were reviewed
- Which ones were addressed (and what changed)
- Which ones were skipped (and why)
