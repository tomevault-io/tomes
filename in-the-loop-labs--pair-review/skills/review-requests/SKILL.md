# Review Requests

Batch-open outstanding GitHub review requests in pair-review with AI analysis.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Discover pair-review server

Call `mcp__pair-review__get_server_info` to get the pair-review web UI URL. If the server
is not running, inform the user and stop.

### Phase 2: Find pending review requests

Use `user-review-requested:@me` (not `review-requested`) to find only PRs where the user
was *directly* requested as a reviewer, excluding team-based review requests. The `gh search prs`
CLI does not support this qualifier, so use the search API directly:

```bash
SINCE=$(date -v-7d +%Y-%m-%d 2>/dev/null || date -d '7 days ago' +%Y-%m-%d)
gh api "search/issues?q=is:pr+is:open+user-review-requested:@me+updated:>=${SINCE}&per_page=30" \
  --jq '.items[] | {number, title, html_url, repo: (.repository_url | split("/")[-2:] | join("/"))}'
```

Each result provides `number`, `title`, `html_url`, and `repo` (as `owner/repo`).

### Phase 3: Open each PR in pair-review with auto-analysis

**Limit**: Open at most **10** PRs. If more than 10 are found, open only the first 10 (most
recently updated) and report how many were skipped.

For each PR found (up to the limit), open it in the browser with the `?analyze=true` query parameter, which
automatically starts AI analysis when the page loads:

```
open "{server_url}/pr/{owner}/{repo}/{number}?analyze=true"
```

where `{owner}/{repo}` comes from the `repo` field split on `/`.

No MCP calls per PR are needed — the `?analyze=true` parameter handles triggering analysis.

### Phase 4: Report

Summarize what was done:
- How many PRs were found with pending review
- List each PR opened in pair-review with title and URL
- If no pending review requests exist, say so
