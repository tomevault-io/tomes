- DOCS_PATH: `docs/`

## When to use

## Inputs to confirm
- Intended behavior change
- Test evidence

## Required artifacts

- Open questions
- Short summary

## Quick path
- Scan for correctness, then safety, then tests.

## Steps
1) Identify behavior changes and edge cases.
2) Verify observability and error handling.
3) Check tests and docs.

## Failure modes and responses
