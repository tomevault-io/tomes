# Testing API Assertions

Verify that your code sends the correct API requests for operations with side effects.

## When to Use Request Assertions

**DO use** for operations with side effects:

- Creating resources (POST)
- Updating resources (PUT/PATCH)
- Deleting resources (DELETE)
- Any mutation that changes backend state

**DON'T use** for read operations:

- Fetching data (GET)
- For these, just verify the component displays the data correctly
- The mock API is not stateful, so verifying GET requests adds no value

## recordRequests()

Use `recordRequests()` to capture all API requests made during a test:

```typescript
import { recordRequests } from '@/common/mocks/node'

it('creates a group with correct payload', async () => {
  const rec = recordRequests()

  // ... perform action that triggers API call ...
  await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /create/i }))

  // Find the request
  const request = rec.recordedRequests.find(
    (r) => r.method === 'POST' && r.pathname === '/api/v1beta/groups'
  )

  // Assert it was made with correct data
  expect(request).toBeDefined()
  expect(request?.payload).toEqual({ name: 'my-group' })
})
```

## Recorded Request Shape

Each recorded request contains:

```typescript
{
  pathname: '/api/v1beta/groups',      // URL path
  method: 'POST',                       // HTTP method
  payload: { name: 'my-group' },        // Parsed JSON body (if present)
  search: { filter: 'active' },         // Query parameters
}
```

## Common Patterns

### Verify POST payload

```typescript
const rec = recordRequests()

// ... trigger create action ...

const createRequest = rec.recordedRequests.find(
  (r) => r.method === 'POST' && r.pathname === '/api/v1beta/workloads'
)
expect(createRequest?.payload).toMatchObject({
  name: 'my-server',
  group: 'default',
})
```

### Verify DELETE was called

```typescript
const rec = recordRequests()

// ... trigger delete action ...

const deleteRequest = rec.recordedRequests.find(
  (r) =>
    r.method === 'DELETE' && r.pathname === '/api/v1beta/workloads/my-server'
)
expect(deleteRequest).toBeDefined()
```

### Verify request order

```typescript
const rec = recordRequests()

// ... trigger actions ...

const postRequests = rec.recordedRequests.filter((r) => r.method === 'POST')
const groupIndex = postRequests.findIndex((r) => r.pathname.includes('/groups'))
const workloadIndex = postRequests.findIndex((r) =>
  r.pathname.includes('/workloads')
)

// Group must be created before workload
expect(groupIndex).toBeLessThan(workloadIndex)
```

### Verify request count

```typescript
const rec = recordRequests()

// ... trigger batch action ...

const deleteRequests = rec.recordedRequests.filter(
  (r) =>
    r.method === 'DELETE' && r.pathname.startsWith('/api/v1beta/workloads/')
)
expect(deleteRequests).toHaveLength(3)
```

## Important Notes

- `recordRequests()` clears previous recordings when called
- Call it at the start of your test, before triggering actions
- Each test starts fresh - recordings don't persist between tests
- Use `toMatchObject()` for partial matching when payload has extra fields

## When NOT to Use This

For read operations (GET) where you need to verify query parameters are sent correctly, **don't** use `recordRequests()`. Instead, use conditional overrides that return different data based on params, then verify the UI shows the expected data. See **testing-api-overrides** skill.

This approach is more robust because it tests actual user-facing behavior.
