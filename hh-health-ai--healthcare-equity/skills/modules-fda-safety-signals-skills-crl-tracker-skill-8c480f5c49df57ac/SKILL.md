# CRL and shortage tracker

Monitor two event streams that invalidate catalysts and create competitor upside:
FDA Complete Response Letters, and drug shortages.

## Complete Response Letters

FDA began publishing CRLs in 2025, so the corpus is shallow and skewed to recent and
historical batch releases. **The absence of a CRL in the dataset is not evidence that
no CRL was issued** — this is the single most important caveat and belongs in every
brief from this skill.

Workflow:

1. Pull recent CRL publications and filter to the coverage universe and to competitors.
2. Classify the deficiency. The classification is what carries the read-across:
   - **CMC / manufacturing** — often resolvable in 6–12 months with a Class 2 resubmission;
     third-party manufacturing sites can affect several sponsors at once, so check who
     else uses the plant.
   - **Clinical / efficacy** — usually requires a new trial. Reset the timeline by
     years, not quarters, and re-run the probability of success.
   - **Safety** — may be fatal to the programme in that indication.
   - **Inspection-related** — a foreign site classified OAI. Look for other sponsors
     with products at the same site; this is where the cross-read money is.
3. Read across to the class. A CRL citing a mechanism-level safety concern raises the
   bar for every competitor with the same mechanism; a CMC CRL says nothing about them.
4. Hand the timeline reset to a catalyst engine → catalyst-calendar, and the
   probability revision to `readout-handicap`.

## Drug shortages

1. Pull `/drug/shortages` and filter to molecules where the coverage universe has an
   approved or filed product.
2. Classify the cause where stated: manufacturing quality, demand increase,
   discontinuation, raw-material supply.
3. Identify the beneficiary. A shortage of a sole-source injectable transfers volume
   to whoever has capacity, and the transfer often persists after resolution because
   hospital contracts are sticky.
4. Watch the flip side: a shortage caused by the covered name's own quality problem is
   a revenue hole plus a warning-letter risk. Cross-check `/drug/enforcement` and the
   FDA warning-letter database for the same site.

## Not-automatic

A published CRL does not license a conclusion about resubmission timing unless the
letter itself states the deficiency type; a shortage listing does not license a market-
share conclusion without capacity evidence from the beneficiary's disclosures.
