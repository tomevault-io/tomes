# PTAB / IPR monitor

Track administrative challenges to the patents that hold up a franchise, and convert
procedural milestones into probability shifts on the LOE date.

## Workflow

1. **Start from the patent stack**, not from the company. Take the patent numbers
   `orange-book-loe` identified as binding and search PTAB for proceedings against each
   (`scripts/ptab_search.py --patent 9,000,000`). Searching by company name misses
   challenges filed against a licensor or a predecessor entity.
2. **Identify the petitioner.** A generic filer signals an entry attempt. A
   competitor-manufacturer or a patent-adverse fund signals something else. Petitioner
   identity changes what a win means commercially.
3. **Track the procedural milestones**, which are the datable catalysts:
   - Petition filed.
   - **Institution decision** — roughly six months after filing. This is the first real
     information event: institution means the Board found a reasonable likelihood that
     at least one claim is unpatentable.
   - **Final written decision** — statutorily within 12 months of institution.
   - Appeal to the Federal Circuit — adds 12–18 months.
   - Note that discretionary denial practice has shifted repeatedly; a petition can be
     denied on discretionary grounds without any view on the merits, which is not a
     win for the patentee on substance.
4. **Score the claims at risk.** Losing a method-of-use claim is usually survivable.
   Losing composition-of-matter is the franchise. Say which claims the petition targets.
5. **Update the LOE distribution.** Move probability mass from *nominal* toward
   *earliest plausible* on institution; move it decisively on a final written decision
   holding claims unpatentable. Re-emit the `orange-book-loe` brief rather than
   reporting the PTAB outcome in isolation.
6. Emit the brief.

## Caveats

USPTO's Open Data Portal API requires a free key (`USPTO_API_KEY`). Proceedings are
available from September 2012 onward. Entity mapping is the practical difficulty:
patent assignee names, Orange Book applicant names and ticker names frequently differ.
Verify the assignment chain before concluding a patent belongs to the covered name.

District-court Hatch-Waxman litigation runs in parallel and is *not* in PTAB; for that,
use the free CourtListener/RECAP docket data and the sponsor's own legal-proceedings
disclosure.

## Not-automatic

An instituted IPR does not license an invalidity assumption — institution rates and
final-outcome rates are very different numbers, and a settlement can end the proceeding
at any point on terms that reveal nothing.
