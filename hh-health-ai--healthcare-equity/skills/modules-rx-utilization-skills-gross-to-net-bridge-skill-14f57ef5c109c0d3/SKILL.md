# Gross-to-net bridge

Assemble a defensible net-price path for a drug from open CMS sources, and mark
clearly where the estimate stops being data and starts being assumption.

## Workflow

1. **Anchor list price.** Pull WAC from the company's own disclosures or a public
   price-transparency filing. Record the date of the last list increase — most large
   caps now take one modest increase per January.
2. **Build the observable net floors.**
   - Medicaid: SDUD total reimbursed ÷ units gives a pre-rebate reimbursement level;
     the statutory Medicaid rebate (23.1% of AMP for most brands, plus the CPI
     penalty) sets a hard floor well below it.
   - Medicare: the CMS Medicare Part B and Part D Spending by Drug dashboards publish
     average spending per dosage unit and annual change — the cleanest open series
     for a Medicare-weighted net trend.
   - 340B: HRSA covered-entity growth in the relevant setting is a structural
     GtN headwind. Size it qualitatively; the discount itself is not public per drug.
3. **Layer the policy calendar.** IRA maximum fair price effective dates, Part D
   redesign (manufacturer liability in the catastrophic phase), and any inflation
   rebate exposure where list increases outran CPI. Pull dates from
   a reimbursement engine rather than re-deriving them here.
4. **Bridge it.** Gross → statutory rebates → commercial rebates and PBM fees →
   340B and other mandated discounts → patient assistance and copay support → net.
   Only the statutory and Medicare components are observable. Label the commercial
   rebate line as the assumption it is, and show the net-revenue sensitivity to it
   at ±5 percentage points.
5. **Sanity-check against reported results.** Company-reported net revenue ÷ your
   estimated volume gives an implied net price. If that implies a GtN outside 
   reasonable bounds for the class, your volume estimate is wrong, not the company's.
6. Emit the brief, with the commercial-rebate assumption named in **Not-automatic**.

## Class heuristics

GtN gaps are widest where PBM competition is fiercest — insulins, respiratory
inhalers, TNF inhibitors, and increasingly the GLP-1 class. They are narrowest in
buy-and-bill oncology and single-source rare disease. A model that applies one house
GtN percentage across a diversified pharma's portfolio will misprice the mix shift,
which is usually the actual driver of net-price surprise.

## Not-automatic

An observable Medicaid or Medicare net level does not license a commercial net price.
The commercial book is where the rebate war happens and it is not public.

Framework anchors: your own valuation framework;
Kongstvedt on PBM and rebate mechanics; MedPAC and KFF for policy context.
