# Ownership and crowding overlay

Assemble a positioning picture from free sources and translate it into a sizing and
liquidity constraint.

## Workflow

1. **Aggregate 13F holdings** for the issuer across the last four quarters. Separate
   the three groups, which behave completely differently:
   - Passive index holders — irrelevant to crowding, large in size.
   - Long-only active — slow, sticky, price-insensitive on the margin.
   - Hedge funds — the crowding that matters.
2. **Compute concentration**: the share of float held by the top 10 active holders,
   and the change in that share over four quarters. The *change* is the signal;
   the level is context.
3. **Pull 13D/G filings** for activist or strategic positions and any recent crossings
   of the 5% threshold.
4. **Layer short interest.** FINRA publishes short interest twice monthly; compute days
   to cover against average daily volume. Check the Reg SHO threshold list for
   persistent delivery failures.
5. **Build the sizing constraint.** Days of the desk's own volume to exit at 20% of ADV,
   under both normal and stressed (one-third) liquidity. This is the number that
   actually binds in a drawdown and the reason this skill exists.
6. **Read the combination.** High hedge-fund concentration plus high days-to-cover plus
   a dated binary catalyst is the setup for violent two-way moves — it argues for a
   smaller position or an options expression, not for a directional view.
7. Emit the brief.

## Caveats that cap confidence

13F is long-only, US-listed, filed 45 days after quarter end, and excludes shorts,
swaps and most derivatives — so it systematically understates hedge-fund exposure and
misses the entire short book. A crowding read from 13F alone is directional at best.
Short interest is twice-monthly with its own lag.

## Non-duplication

The desk already runs your valuation tooling for what the price implies and
`macro-pm-lens` for crowding as a discipline question. This skill supplies the raw
positioning evidence to those, and does not restate their conclusions.

## Not-automatic

Crowding is not a directional signal. It is a constraint on size and on the expression
of a view, and briefs from this skill must say so.
