# Respiratory surveillance nowcast

Convert weekly public surveillance into a near-term demand read for respiratory
vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics — and be explicit about what is provisional.

## Workflow

1. **Pull the series** (`scripts/surveillance.py`): outpatient influenza-like illness
   (wILI), clinical and public-health laboratory percent positivity by pathogen,
   hospitalisation rates, and wastewater concentration levels from NWSS.
2. **Establish the baseline.** Compare against the same week in the previous three to
   five seasons, not against last week. Respiratory demand is violently seasonal and a
   week-on-week number tells you almost nothing.
3. **Separate activity from testing.** Percent positivity rises when activity rises *or*
   when testing narrows to symptomatic patients. Test volume and positivity must be read
   together, and a positivity spike with falling test volume is mostly a testing artefact.
4. **Watch coverage changes.** Laboratory participation in NREVSS and site participation
   in NWSS change between seasons. A step in the series that coincides with a
   participation change is not epidemiology.
5. **Map to the revenue line.** Different products respond to different parts of the
   curve, at different lags:
   - **Vaccines**: demand is set in the September–November administration window and by
     retail pharmacy capacity, not by peak season severity. A severe December helps next
     season's uptake more than this season's revenue.
   - **Diagnostics**: respond within one to two weeks of activity; the most direct link.
   - **Antivirals**: track symptomatic presentations and prescribing, lagging activity
     slightly.
   - **Hospital-facing products**: track the hospitalisation series, which lags cases.
6. **Size it.** State the revenue line, the historical relationship between the series
   and reported quarterly revenue for that product in prior seasons, and the residual.
   A nowcast with no historical fit is a chart, not evidence.
7. Emit the brief with **provisional** stated in the vintage field.

## Not-automatic

Surveillance activity does not license a revenue conclusion without the historical
relationship between the series and that specific product's reported revenue. Severity
and revenue are related but the relationship differs by product type and by season.
