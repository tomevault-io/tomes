# Nonprofit 990 scan

Read the non-listed majority of the US hospital market through IRS Form 990 filings.

## Workflow

1. **Find the filer** (`scripts/propublica_990.py --search "Advocate Health"`). Large
   systems file through many related entities; the parent's 990 is not the whole system,
   and obligated-group financial statements on EMMA (municipal bond disclosure) often
   give a better system-wide view than any single 990.
2. **Pull the financial summary**: total revenue, total expenses, net income, total
   assets, net assets. Trend across the available years.
3. **Go into the full filing for Schedule H.** The API summary does not carry it. The
   XML filing does, and Schedule H is where the interesting content is: charity care at
   cost, unreimbursed Medicaid, community health improvement, and the financial
   assistance policy. Charity care as a share of expenses is the number that carries
   both regulatory risk and demand information.
4. **Read executive compensation (Schedule J)** as a governance and cost-discipline
   signal, not for its own sake.
5. **Benchmark.** A single system's margin means little; the same system against its
   regional peers and against MedPAC's all-hospital margin benchmark means a lot.
6. **Convert to the investment question.** Non-profit system margin and balance-sheet
   strength drive: capital equipment purchasing, willingness to take risk-based
   contracts, and receptivity to new technology with a payback period. That is the
   read-through for listed suppliers and for value-based-care enablers.
7. Emit the brief, with the lag stated plainly.

## Caveats

Roughly one year or more of lag, and filings arrive irregularly. Entity structures are
complex and consolidations differ from GAAP. Schedule H definitions of charity care
changed over time and are applied inconsistently between systems, so cross-system
comparison of charity care needs care. ProPublica's API is free subject to their data
terms of use; respect them and cache rather than re-querying.

## Not-automatic

A non-profit system's 990 margin does not license a conclusion about a listed
competitor's pricing power in the same market without local share and payer data.
