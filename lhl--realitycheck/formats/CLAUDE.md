# Reality Check - Development Guide

Please refer to `README.md`, `docs/PLAN-separation.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md`, and `docs/DEPLOY.md` for project-specific details.
This `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` is specifically for ground rules, process, and behavior notes.

## Shared Repo / Multi-Agent Safety (MUST FOLLOW)

This repo may be edited by multiple agents concurrently. Treat the working tree as shared state.

### Before any change (required)
- Run `git status --porcelain`.
- If the working tree has unrelated changes, proceed normally but do not touch them; stage only your own files (`git add <paths>` / `git add -p`).
- If you need to edit a file that already has changes you did not create (potential conflict), flag it and ask the user how to proceed.
- If there are merge conflicts, STOP and ask the user how to proceed.

### Never discard others’ work (hard rule)
- NEVER run any command that can delete/overwrite existing work unless the user explicitly instructs it.
  This includes (but is not limited to):
  - `git restore ...`
  - `git checkout -- ...`
  - `git checkout .`
  - `git reset --hard ...`
  - `git clean -fd ...`
  - `rm -rf ...` / overwriting redirects like `> file`
  - bulk rewrites that destroy local edits (e.g., aggressive formatters) unless requested

### Scope discipline
- Only edit files needed for the user’s current request.
- Do not “clean up”, refactor, or revert unrelated diffs in touched files.
- If you need to avoid committing unrelated diffs, use `git add <paths>` or `git add -p`; never “fix” by reverting other hunks.

### If conflicts are unavoidable
- Coordinate: propose a plan that preserves both sets of edits (e.g., separate commits/branches/patches),
  and wait for explicit user instruction before any destructive resolution.

## Project Overview

Reality Check is a framework for rigorous, systematic analysis of claims, sources, predictions, and argument chains. It provides:
- LanceDB-backed storage with semantic search
- Structured methodology for claim extraction and evaluation
- Evidence hierarchy and prediction tracking
- Claude Code plugin for workflow automation

## Roles (Planners / Coders / Reviewers)

We use separate lanes for development work:

- **Planner**: produces/updates specs and punchlists in `docs/` (typically between sprints).
- **Coder**: owns all implementation patches (code + tests) and repo changes.
- **Reviewer**: analysis-only; must not author implementation patches (no code changes).
- **Human lead**: arbitrates scope, risk, and disagreements; decides what is a blocker vs a deferral.

Rules:
- Reviewers provide findings + rationale + suggested fixes, but do not change the repo.
- Coders translate reviewer findings into tracked punchlist/checklist entries before implementing fixes.
- Reviewer follow-up is confirmation-only (resolved / unresolved with rationale), not code changes.

## Development Philosophy: Spec → Plan → Test → Implement

**This project is strictly spec/plan/test-driven.** The goal is a high-quality, maintainable framework that's easy to update and extend. Every feature follows this cycle:

### The Cycle

1. **Spec**: Define requirements clearly in `docs/` before writing any code
2. **Plan**: Create implementation plan with affected files (tree diagram)
3. **Test**: Write unit tests AND e2e tests BEFORE implementation
4. **Implement**: Write minimal code to pass the tests
5. **Validate**: Run full test suite - all tests must pass
6. **Commit**: Atomic commits with passing tests only

### Why Tests First?

- **Clarifies requirements** - Writing tests forces you to think through edge cases
- **Prevents scope creep** - You only implement what the tests require
- **Enables refactoring** - Tests catch regressions when you improve code later
- **Documents behavior** - Tests are executable specifications
- **Catches bugs early** - Faster to fix issues before code is "done"

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Unit tests**: Every public function in `scripts/*.py` must have tests
- **E2E tests**: Every user workflow must have integration tests
- **Edge cases**: Error paths, empty inputs, boundary conditions
- **No skipping**: If a test fails, fix it before proceeding

## Documentation as Source of Truth

- Treat `docs/` as the source of truth and always prioritize keeping them up to date
- `docs/PLAN-separation.md` - Architecture and implementation plan
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Progress tracking (punchlist + worklog)
- `docs/DEPLOY.md` - Release quick reference
- `docs/PUBLISH.md` - Full release punch list (PyPI + GitHub)
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` - Release notes
- When reporting stats/counts (tests, claims, churn, LOC, coverage), scope them to a specific commit/tag and record the exact command(s) used
- When making changes: update docs, run tests, then commit

## Workflow Expectations

### Before Picking Up Work
- Check git status/log for recent changes
- Review open items in the active implementation doc (`docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` or the relevant `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-*.md`)
- Confirm your plan aligns with documented approach
- For non-trivial work, add a brief pre-analysis note in the active implementation doc before coding (scope, risks, validation plan)
- **Review existing tests** to understand expected behavior

### During Execution
- **Write tests first** for the feature/fix you're implementing
- Leave breadcrumbs in the active implementation doc (commands run, decisions made)
- Run tests incrementally as you go
- Keep commits atomic and focused

### After Changes
- Update the active implementation doc (check items, add notes)
- Run targeted tests, then broader suites as needed (see Validation Matrix below)
- **All tests must pass** before committing
- Commit with descriptive message

### After Changes Validation Matrix

```bash
# 1) Targeted (fast): run the narrowest tests that match your change
uv run pytest tests/test_db.py -q
uv run pytest tests/test_validate.py::TestSpecificCheck -q

# 2) Focused suites (run when relevant to your change)
uv run pytest tests/test_db.py tests/test_validate.py -q
uv run python scripts/validate.py  # if data exists

# 3) Full suite (milestone closure or before claiming completion of non-trivial work)
uv run pytest -v

# 4) Optional (coverage + embedding tests)
uv run pytest --cov=scripts --cov-report=term-missing
REALITYCHECK_EMBED_SKIP=1 uv run pytest -v  # skip embedding tests if torch issues
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest -v

# Skip embedding tests if torch issues
REALITYCHECK_EMBED_SKIP=1 uv run pytest -v

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=scripts --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_db.py

# Run specific test class
uv run pytest tests/test_db.py::TestClaimsCRUD
```

### Test Structure

```
tests/
├── conftest.py        # Shared fixtures (temp_db_path, sample_claim, etc.)
├── test_db.py         # Unit tests for db.py
├── test_migrate.py    # Unit tests for migrate.py
├── test_validate.py   # Unit tests for validate.py
├── test_export.py     # Unit tests for export.py
└── test_e2e.py        # End-to-end integration tests
```

### Pre-Commit Checklist

- [ ] Tests pass: `uv run pytest`
- [ ] Validation passes: `uv run python scripts/validate.py` (if data exists)
- [ ] Staged diff reviewed: `git diff --staged --name-only` then `git diff --staged`
- [ ] No untracked files in commit
- [ ] Commit message is descriptive

## Git Practices

- **Commit frequently** with descriptive messages
- **No bylines** or co-author footers in commits
- **Use conventional commits**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`
- **Add files explicitly** - never use `git add .`, `git add -A`, or `git commit -a`
- **ALWAYS** verify staged files before commit using `git diff --staged --name-only`
- **ALWAYS** review the staged diff before commit using `git diff --staged`
- If unrelated changes exist in the worktree, leave them untouched
- **Atomic commits** - group related changes, separate unrelated ones
- **Run validation** before pushing

### Commit Message Format

```
type: short summary (imperative mood)

- Bullet points for details if needed
- What changed and why
```

Examples:
```
feat: add semantic search to db.py CLI
docs: update PLAN-separation.md with plugin distribution
fix: handle empty lists in PyArrow schema conversion
test: add claim relationship tests
```

## Code Quality

### Before Submitting Code
- [ ] Self-review: is this understandable without explanation?
- [ ] Modular: can each function be understood in isolation?
- [ ] Tested: are success and error paths covered?
- [ ] Documented: do complex parts have comments?

### Common Patterns

**Environment variable for DB path:**
```python
DB_PATH = Path(os.environ.get("REALITYCHECK_DATA", "data/realitycheck.lance"))
```

**CLI subcommands in db.py:**
```python
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest="command")
subparsers.add_parser("init", help="Initialize database")
# ... etc
```

**Test fixtures:**
```python
@pytest.fixture
def sample_claim():
    return {
        "id": "TEST-2026-001",
        "text": "Test claim",
        "type": "[T]",
        "domain": "TEST",
        # ...
    }
```

## Claim Integrity and Definition of Done

### Claim Integrity (Done/Shipped/Complete)

Any claim of "done", "shipped", "complete", or "closed" must include evidence for all three:

- **Test evidence**: exact validation command(s) + outcomes (include e2e when relevant).
- **Runtime/wiring evidence**: where the behavior is enforced in the live path (not just a helper function).
- **Docs parity evidence**: punchlist/worklog updated, and relevant docs updated when behavior/guarantees change.

Truth-in-claims:
- Use truth-scoped wording; do not overclaim universal behavior when behavior is conditional (e.g., optional backends, feature flags, tool-specific paths).
- Prefer "when X is enabled" / "in mode Y" / "fails closed when Z is unavailable" over "always/guarantees/prevents".

### Definition of Done (Features)

- [ ] Code implemented (minimal patch)
- [ ] Tests green (targeted + relevant suites; full suite at milestone closure)
- [ ] Claim-integrity evidence recorded (tests + runtime + docs parity)
- [ ] Any remaining gaps explicitly deferred (see below)

### Deferrals

- Unresolved items stay in the active milestone's deferrals list in the relevant `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-*.md`.
- Each deferral must include: **ID**, **rationale**, **risk**, and **target milestone/version**.
- Use `docs/TODO.md` for items beyond the current release scope (post-release backlog).

### Review Trace (Findings -> IDs -> Commits)

- Convert reviewer findings into tracked IDs before remediation.
- Commit messages for remediation should reference the finding ID and whether it is initial remediation or re-review closure.
- Log the exact validation commands + outcomes in the implementation worklog when closing items.

## Plugin Development

The Claude Code plugin lives in `integrations/claude/plugin/` and provides slash commands that inject methodology + call scripts.

### Plugin Structure
```
integrations/claude/plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json    # Metadata
├── commands/*.md                  # Slash command definitions
├── hooks/hooks.json               # Lifecycle hooks
├── scripts/*.sh                   # Shell wrappers for Python scripts
└── lib/                           # Bundled Python scripts (for distribution)
```

### Testing Commands
Use the `--plugin-dir` flag (local plugin discovery is currently broken):
```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/realitycheck/integrations/claude/plugin
```

### Keeping Hooks and Skills in Sync

The Claude plugin includes lifecycle hooks that automate tasks like auto-commit after database operations. Codex (and other integrations) don't support hooks, so skills must document equivalent manual steps.

**Source of truth:** `integrations/claude/plugin/hooks/` scripts define the canonical behavior.

When modifying hook behavior:
1. Update the hook script (e.g., `auto-commit-data.sh`)
2. Update corresponding skill docs to describe the manual equivalent
3. Update `docs/WORKFLOWS.md` to note any cross-tool differences

Key sync points:
- **Auto-commit:** `hooks/post-db-modify.sh` → Codex skill "Data Repo Version Control" section
- **README stats:** `scripts/update-readme-stats.sh` → Codex skill optional step (also used by plugin hooks)

## Handling Blockers

If you encounter:
- **Permission issues**: Stop and flag for resolution
- **Test failures**: Fix before proceeding (don't skip)
- **Unclear requirements**: Check docs first, then ask
- **Merge conflicts**: Resolve carefully, test after

## Meta: Evolving This File

This AGENTS.md is a living document. Update it when:
- You discover a workflow pattern that helps
- Something caused confusion
- A new tool or process gets introduced
- You learn something that would help the next person

Keep changes focused on process/behavior, not project-specific details (those go in docs/).
