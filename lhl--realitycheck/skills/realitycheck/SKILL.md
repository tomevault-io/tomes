# Cross-Source Synthesis

Create a cross-source synthesis across multiple source analyses and claims. Use after checking multiple sources or when producing a higher-level, decision-oriented view.

## Usage

```
<topic> [source-ids/claim-ids in prompt]
```

Create a **cross-source synthesis** across multiple source analyses and existing claims.

Use this after running `$check` on multiple sources (or when you already have relevant source analyses and want a higher-level conclusion).

Note: For multi-source prompts, `$check` should typically produce the synthesis automatically; `$rc-synthesize` is the standalone/iterative version of that workflow.

## Prerequisites

### Environment

Set `REALITYCHECK_DATA` to point to your data repository:

```bash
export REALITYCHECK_DATA=/path/to/realitycheck-data/data/realitycheck.lance
```

The `PROJECT_ROOT` is derived from this path - all analysis files go there.

### CLI Commands

Reality Check provides CLI tools (`rc-db`, `rc-validate`, `rc-export`, `rc-embed`).

**Check availability:**
```bash
which rc-db  # Should show path if pip-installed
```

**If commands are not found**, either:
1. Install: `pip install realitycheck` (recommended)
2. Use `uv run` from framework directory: `uv run python scripts/db.py ...`
3. Add framework as submodule and use: `.framework/scripts/db.py ...`

### Red Flags: Wrong Repository

**IMPORTANT**: Always write to the DATA repository, never to the framework repository.

If you see these directories, you're in the **framework** repo (wrong place for data):
- `scripts/`
- `tests/`
- `integrations/`
- `methodology/`

Stop and verify `REALITYCHECK_DATA` is set correctly.

### Data Source of Truth

**LanceDB is the source of truth**, not YAML files.

- Query sources: `rc-db source get <id>` or `rc-db source list`
- Query claims: `rc-db claim get <id>` or `rc-db claim list`
- Search: `rc-db search "query"`

**Ignore YAML files** like `claims/registry.yaml` or `reference/sources.yaml` - these are exports/legacy format.

## When to Use

Run synthesis when the task is inherently **multi-source**:
- compare/contrast competing approaches
- reconcile conflicting claims
- summarize the overall state of evidence on a topic
- produce a decision-oriented “what should we believe?” output

## Output Contract

Write a synthesis document to:
`PROJECT_ROOT/analysis/syntheses/<synth-id>.md`

**Required elements**:
1. **Synthesis metadata** (topic, date, synthesis ID)
2. **Claims referenced** (claim IDs)
3. **Source analysis links** for relevant sources (prefer linking `analysis/sources/<source-id>.md`)
4. **Agreement/disagreement** with explanations
5. **Synthesis conclusions** with calibrated credence and key uncertainties

**Corner case**: If you have *claims/evidence but no analyzable sources*, explicitly say so and explain why (e.g., internal notes, private sources, offline materials). Still reference claim IDs and any evidence artifacts available.

## Workflow

1. **Start Tracking** - Begin token usage capture with synthesis attribution
2. **Define the question** - What is this synthesis trying to answer?
3. **Collect inputs**
   - Prefer existing source analyses in `analysis/sources/`
   - If a relevant source has no analysis yet, run `$check` first (or document the gap)
4. **Build a cross-source map**
   - Points of agreement (which claims converge?)
   - Points of disagreement (where do they conflict, and why?)
5. **Write the synthesis**
   - Link each major claim back to source analyses (when available)
   - Resolve conflicts where possible; otherwise record open questions + what would resolve them
6. **(Optional) Register an argument chain**
   - Use `rc-db chain add ... --analysis-file "analysis/syntheses/<synth-id>.md" --claims "ID1,ID2,..."` for the central claim chain
7. **Complete Tracking** - Finalize token usage with synthesis attribution
8. **Update README**
   - Add the synthesis to the "Syntheses" table (kept **above** "Source Analyses")
9. **Commit and push**
   - Commit changes to `analysis/` and `README.md` (and any generated exports), then push

## Token Usage Tracking (Synthesis Mode)

For syntheses, use the lifecycle commands with attribution flags to track which source analyses feed into the synthesis:

```bash
# 1. At workflow START
ANALYSIS_ID=$(rc-db analysis start \
  --source-id "SYNTH-[YYYY]-[NNN]" \
  --tool claude-code \
  --model "claude-sonnet-4" \
  --cmd synthesize)

# 2. At workflow END (after writing synthesis)
# Include --inputs-source-ids and --inputs-analysis-ids for cost attribution
rc-db analysis complete \
  --id "$ANALYSIS_ID" \
  --analysis-file "analysis/syntheses/[synth-id].md" \
  --inputs-source-ids "source-id-1,source-id-2" \
  --inputs-analysis-ids "ANALYSIS-2026-001,ANALYSIS-2026-002" \
  --estimate-cost \
  --notes "Cross-source synthesis"
```

The `inputs_source_ids` and `inputs_analysis_ids` fields enable end-to-end cost tracking: you can trace a synthesis back to its constituent analyses and sum their costs.

## Minimal Template Snippet

```markdown
# Synthesis: [Topic]

## Synthesis Metadata

- **Synthesis ID**: `SYNTH-[YYYY]-[NNN]`
- **Topic**: [question or topic]
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Source Analyses**:
  - [source-id](../sources/source-id.md)
  - ...
- **Claims Referenced**: TECH-2026-001, ...
```
