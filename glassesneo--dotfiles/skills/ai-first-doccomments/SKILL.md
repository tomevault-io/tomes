# AI-First DocComments

Write documentation that serves as high-quality metadata for AI code search while remaining useful to human developers.

## Core Principle: Colocation

Embed specifications directly in source code rather than maintaining separate documentation files. AI agents struggle to cross-reference external specs; colocated documentation ensures context is always immediately available.

## Three Required Elements

Every DocComment should include these elements when applicable:

### 1. Ubiquitous Language (Domain Terms)

Use exact terminology from business stakeholders, designers, and product specs.

```typescript
// ✗ Poor: Technical-only naming
/** Handles org data display */

// ✓ Good: Business terminology included
/** UI-05 Company Detail Screen - Displays company information */
```

### 2. UI/Feature Identifiers

Include IDs linking to design files, issue trackers, or feature specs.

```python
# ✗ Poor: No traceability
def process_order():
    """Process the order."""

# ✓ Good: Traceable reference
def process_order():
    """
    FEAT-1234 Order Processing
    Figma: https://figma.com/file/xxx
    """
```

### 3. Non-Obvious Logic

Document constraints, edge cases, and business rules not inferable from code.

```typescript
// ✗ Poor: States the obvious
/** Returns user data */

// ✓ Good: Documents constraints
/**
 * Returns user profile data.
 * Requires 'admin' or 'viewer' role.
 * Returns null for soft-deleted users (deleted_at != null).
 * Rate limited: 100 requests/minute per API key.
 */
```

## Complete Example

```typescript
/**
 * UI-05 Company Detail Screen
 * JIRA: PROJ-1234
 *
 * Displays detailed company information including contacts and history.
 *
 * Access: Requires authenticated user with 'admin' or 'viewer' role.
 * Routing: Invalid company_id redirects to 404 page.
 * Cache: Company data cached for 5 minutes; invalidated on update.
 */
export class CompanyDetailScreen extends Component {
  // ...
}
```

## Why This Works

1. **Searchability**: AI agents using grep/ripgrep locate code via natural language or IDs without hallucinating paths
2. **LLM Alignment**: Models are trained on OSS where docs precede implementations; `DocComment → Code` is the optimal pattern
3. **Semantic Search**: Code intelligence tools can extract symbol + documentation as a single unit, providing both "what" and "why"
4. **Token Efficiency**: Colocated specs eliminate round-trips to external files, reducing context window usage

## Language-Specific Formats

| Language   | Format   | Example                          |
| ---------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| TypeScript | TSDoc    | `/** @remarks UI-05 */`          |
| Python     | Docstring| `"""FEAT-123 Description"""`    |
| Rust       | Doc      | `/// # UI-05 Company Screen`     |
| Go         | Comment  | `// CompanyScreen handles UI-05` |
| Java       | Javadoc  | `/** @see JIRA-456 */`           |

## Quick Checklist

Before committing, verify each public symbol's DocComment includes:

- [ ] Feature/UI identifier (if applicable)
- [ ] Domain terminology matching specs/designs
- [ ] Access requirements or preconditions
- [ ] Edge cases and error behaviors
- [ ] Links to external resources (Figma, JIRA, etc.)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Restating code**: `/** Adds two numbers */ function add(a, b)`
- **Missing constraints**: Omitting auth requirements, rate limits, or validation rules
- **Technical-only language**: Using only programmer terms when business terms exist
- **Orphaned specs**: Keeping specifications in separate markdown files AI won't find
