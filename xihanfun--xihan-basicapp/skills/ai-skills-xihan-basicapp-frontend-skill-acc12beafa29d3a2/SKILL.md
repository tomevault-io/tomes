# XiHan.BasicApp Frontend Development

## Start Here

Before editing frontend code:

1. Read `frontend/package.json`, `frontend/vite.config.ts`, and the nearest existing page/API/store files for the feature area.
2. Inspect both aliases: `@` points to `frontend/src`, and `~` points to `frontend/packages`.
3. Treat `vue-business-frontend` as inspiration for typed API facades, clear state boundaries, dense business UI, and verification habits only. Do not import its Ant Design Vue stack or generic `app/pages/shared` layout into this repository.

## Project Shape

The frontend is a Vue 3 business admin app:

```text
frontend/
  src/
    api/
      modules/
    app/
    router/
    styles/
    types/
    views/
  packages/
    components/
    composables/
    constants/
    hooks/
    layouts/
    locales/
    request/
    router/
    stores/
    types/
    utils/
    views/
```

Use the existing ownership model:

- `frontend/src/views/<domain>`: route-level business pages.
- `frontend/src/api/modules/<domain>`: backend-facing typed API modules.
- `frontend/src/api/modules/<domain>/*.types.ts`: DTO and query types for the adjacent API module.
- `frontend/packages/request`: shared Axios request wrapper, token refresh, request logging, locale/timezone/security headers, and flat response helpers.
- `frontend/packages/router`: core routes, static permission filtering, dynamic backend menu route mapping, and fallback view resolution.
- `frontend/packages/stores`: Pinia stores for user, access, app, notification, chat, layout, tabs, favorites, and cross-page state.
- `frontend/packages/components`: reusable schema, RBAC, chat, and common components.
- `frontend/packages/locales`: i18n messages. Add user-facing text through locale keys when the surrounding feature is localized.

## Non-Negotiable Boundaries

- Keep Vue 3, Vite, TypeScript, Pinia, Vue Router, Naive UI, Tailwind CSS 4, Iconify, Axios, SignalR, and vue-i18n.
- Do not convert UI work to Ant Design Vue.
- Do not restructure the app into a generic `app/pages/shared` scaffold.
- Keep backend calls behind typed API modules. Pages and stores should not call raw `fetch`.
- Use `createDynamicApiClient('<ServiceName>')` for Dynamic API services and `formatDynamicApiRouteValue` for route values when adjacent modules do so.
- Keep command/query API clients aligned with backend Dynamic API service names, such as `AiPrompt` and `AiPromptQuery`.
- Keep DTO types adjacent to API modules in `*.types.ts` files and reuse shared primitives such as `ApiId`, `BasicDto`, `DateTimeString`, `PageRequest`, and `PageResult`.
- Keep route metadata compatible with dynamic menu mapping: backend component paths may be converted by `frontend/packages/router/dynamic.ts`.
- Use Pinia stores for cross-page state; keep page-local filters, drawers, modals, selection, pagination, and loading state in the page or a page-local composable.
- Keep permission checks aligned with `usePermission`, `useUserStore`, `useAccessStore`, and backend permission codes. Hiding a button in the frontend never replaces backend permission enforcement.
- Use Naive UI components and Iconify icons in action buttons, tables, forms, drawers, modals, tabs, tags, empty states, and tooltips.
- Preserve the dense, work-focused admin style. Avoid marketing-style hero sections inside console pages.
- Preserve mobile and narrow viewport usability when editing shared layouts, schema components, chat surfaces, auth pages, or high-traffic management pages.

## Frontend Change Workflow

For a new frontend capability:

1. Locate the owning route page under `frontend/src/views/<domain>` or create it only when no suitable page exists.
2. Add or extend typed DTOs in the adjacent `frontend/src/api/modules/<domain>/*.types.ts` file.
3. Add or extend facade methods in `frontend/src/api/modules/<domain>/<feature>.ts`.
4. Reuse existing schema/list/table/search/import/export components before creating new generic components.
5. Add i18n keys in `frontend/packages/locales/langs/*` when nearby pages use locale keys.
6. Add route metadata only in the appropriate static route file when the page is static; dynamic menu-driven pages should stay compatible with backend menu component paths.
7. Add permission-aware UI actions using existing hooks/stores and the backend permission codes.
8. Verify type safety and build output before reporting success.

## Contribution Conventions

When adding or changing frontend code:

- Use the scripts in `frontend/package.json` for linting, formatting, type checking, and builds.
- Use `frontend/.editorconfig` and `frontend/.prettierrc.mjs` as the formatting sources of truth.
- VS Code and editor plugins can be useful local tools, but they are not required project gates.
- When committing frontend-only documentation or code changes, use one of the conventional prefixes listed in `AGENTS.md`.

## Verification

Use focused verification first, then broaden when shared behavior changes.

Common commands from `frontend/`:

```bash
pnpm type-check
pnpm build
pnpm lint
pnpm dev
```

For UI layout changes, inspect affected routes in a browser or screenshot workflow. Check that text does not overlap, tables fit their containers, icon-only actions have tooltips or labels, loading/empty/error states are visible, and dialogs/drawers are usable on narrow viewports.
