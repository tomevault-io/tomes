description: Turning a workflow this session learned into a reusable skill. Use when the user says save this as a skill or make a skill for this, when they repeat the same correction or instructions a second time, or when a multi-step procedure just worked and will clearly recur. Use when this capability is needed.

# Skill creator

1. **Check the index first.** If an existing skill already covers the
   workflow, extend that skill's file instead of creating a near-duplicate.
2. **Confirm before creating.** A skill is a repo or config file; say what
   you are about to write and where, and get a yes. Exception: the user
   already asked for the skill in this turn.
3. **Pick the root by scope.** Project-specific workflow:
   `.aster/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in the repo. Personal preference that
   applies everywhere: `<aster home>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Kebab-case
   name, under 64 characters.
4. **The description is the trigger, so write it as one.** The index shows
   only name and description; the body loads when a request matches. State
   what the skill does, then the concrete situations that should fire it:
   "Use when the user asks to X, mentions Y, or a Z fails."
5. **Body format: numbered imperative rules with counter-examples.** Each
   rule is one behavior, stated as a command, with a literal do-this and
   never-this where it helps. Write "Stage named files: `git add src/a.rs`.
   Never `git add -A`." Never write essays about philosophy.
6. **Capture the evidence, not the theory.** Put in the exact commands that
   worked this session, the failure that motivated the rule, and the check
   that proves the workflow succeeded. A skill mined from a real session
   beats one written from imagination.
7. **Keep it small.** A few hundred to a couple thousand words. Past that,
   split into two skills with distinct triggers.
8. **Frontmatter is exactly `name` and `description`** between `---` fences,
   then the markdown body. Verify after writing: the skill should appear in
   the index next session, and `read_skill` should return the body now.
9. **Corrections are skill fuel.** When the user corrects the same thing a
   second time, that is the signal: offer to fold it into a skill or a
   `remember` note so they never repeat it again.

## Loader rules and tooling

Validation enforced by aster's loader: the file must open with a `---`
frontmatter fence; `description` is required, non-empty, max 1024 characters;
`name` is optional (falls back to the directory name) but when present must be
lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens, max 64 characters.

`always: true` is for a skill with no "when": one that governs every message of
a session, such as a harness where the device is the whole subject. Its body
goes into the system prompt once, it is left out of the list the model scans,
and `read_skill` on it just says it is already loaded. Everything else stays
on-demand: an always-on skill spends its tokens on every turn whether or not
the turn needs it.

Scaffold and lint from the CLI:

```sh
aster skills init my-skill                            # scaffold my-skill/SKILL.md
aster skills add ./my-skill -l                        # validate: listed if it parses, warns if not
aster skills add ./my-skill --all --yes --force       # install user-global, live next turn
aster skills add ./my-skill --all --yes --force -p    # or into this project only
```

`add -l` against a local path is the fastest check: a skill that does not
appear in the listing failed frontmatter validation.

Install a skill the moment it is written, and again after every edit; `--all`
is required when no terminal is attached and `--force` replaces the installed
copy. Do not save a memory about a skill you wrote: the skill is the record.

To publish a skills repo, host one subdirectory per skill under `skills/`
(`skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`); consumers install with
`aster skills add owner/repo`. Names must be unique within a repo; on
collision the first found wins.
