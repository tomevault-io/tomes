# Searching Messages

This skill helps you search through past conversations to recall context that may have fallen out of your context window.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks "do you remember when we discussed X?"
- You need context from an earlier conversation
- User references something from the past that you don't have in context
- You want to verify what was said before about a topic
- You need to find which agent discussed a specific topic (use with `finding-agents` skill)

## CLI Usage

```bash
letta messages search --query <text> [options]
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--query <text>` | Search query (required) |
| `--mode <mode>` | Search mode: `vector`, `fts`, `hybrid` (default: hybrid) |
| `--start-date <date>` | Filter messages after this date (ISO format) |
| `--end-date <date>` | Filter messages before this date (ISO format) |
| `--limit <n>` | Max results (default: 10) |
| `--all-agents` | Search all agents, not just current agent |
| `--agent <id>` | Explicit agent ID (overrides LETTA_AGENT_ID) |
| `--agent-id <id>` | Alias for `--agent` |

### Search Modes

- **hybrid** (default): Combines vector similarity + full-text search with RRF scoring
- **vector**: Semantic similarity search (good for conceptual matches)
- **fts**: Full-text search (good for exact phrases)

## Companion Command: messages list

Use this to expand around a found needle by message ID cursor:

```bash
letta messages list [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--after <message-id>` | Get messages after this ID (cursor) |
| `--before <message-id>` | Get messages before this ID (cursor) |
| `--order <asc\|desc>` | Sort order (default: desc = newest first) |
| `--limit <n>` | Max results (default: 20) |
| `--agent <id>` | Explicit agent ID (overrides LETTA_AGENT_ID) |
| `--agent-id <id>` | Alias for `--agent` |

## Search Strategies

### Strategy 1: Needle + Expand (Recommended)

Use when you need full conversation context around a specific topic:

1. **Find the needle** - Search with keywords to discover relevant messages:
   ```bash
   letta messages search --query "flicker inline approval" --limit 5
   ```

2. **Note the message_id** - Find the most relevant result and copy its `message_id`

3. **Expand before** - Get messages leading up to the needle:
   ```bash
   letta messages list --before "message-xyz" --limit 10
   ```

4. **Expand after** - Get messages following the needle (use `--order asc` for chronological):
   ```bash
   letta messages list --after "message-xyz" --order asc --limit 10
   ```

### Strategy 2: Date-Bounded Search

Use when you know approximately when something was discussed:

```bash
letta messages search --query "topic" --start-date "2025-12-31T00:00:00Z" --end-date "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z" --limit 15
```

Results are sorted by relevance within the date window.

### Strategy 3: Broad Discovery

Use when you're not sure what you're looking for:

```bash
letta messages search --query "vague topic" --mode vector --limit 10
```

Vector mode finds semantically similar messages even without exact keyword matches.

### Strategy 4: Find Which Agent Discussed Something

Use with `--all-agents` to search across all agents and identify which one discussed a topic:

```bash
letta messages search --query "authentication refactor" --all-agents --limit 10
```

Results include `agent_id` for each message. Use this to:
1. Find the agent that worked on a specific feature
2. Identify the right agent to ask follow-up questions
3. Cross-reference with the `finding-agents` skill to get agent details

**Tip:** Load both `searching-messages` and `finding-agents` skills together when you need to find and identify agents by topic.

## Search Output

Returns search results with:
- `message_id` - Use this for cursor-based expansion
- `message_type` - `user_message`, `assistant_message`, `reasoning_message`
- `content` or `reasoning` - The actual message text
- `created_at` - When the message was sent (ISO format)
- `agent_id` - Which agent the message belongs to
