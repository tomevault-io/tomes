# Finding Agents

This skill helps you find other agents on the same Letta server.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks about other agents they have
- User wants to find a specific agent by name
- User wants to list agents with certain tags
- You need to find an agent ID for memory migration
- You found an agent_id via message search and need details about that agent

## CLI Usage

```bash
letta agents list [options]
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--name <name>` | Exact name match |
| `--query <text>` | Fuzzy search by name |
| `--tags <tag1,tag2>` | Filter by tags (comma-separated) |
| `--match-all-tags` | Require ALL tags (default: ANY) |
| `--include-blocks` | Include agent.blocks in response |
| `--limit <n>` | Max results (default: 20) |

## Common Patterns

### Finding Letta Code Agents

Agents created by Letta Code are tagged with `origin:letta-code`. To find only Letta Code agents:

```bash
letta agents list --tags "origin:letta-code"
```

This is useful when the user is looking for agents they've worked with in Letta Code CLI sessions.

### Finding All Agents

If the user has agents created outside Letta Code (via ADE, SDK, etc.), search without the tag filter:

```bash
letta agents list
```

## Examples

**List all agents (up to 20):**
```bash
letta agents list
```

**Find agent by exact name:**
```bash
letta agents list --name "ProjectX-v1"
```

**Search agents by name (fuzzy):**
```bash
letta agents list --query "project"
```

**Find only Letta Code agents:**
```bash
letta agents list --tags "origin:letta-code"
```

**Find agents with multiple tags:**
```bash
letta agents list --tags "frontend,production" --match-all-tags
```

**Include memory blocks in results:**
```bash
letta agents list --query "project" --include-blocks
```

## Output

Returns the raw API response with full agent details. Key fields:
- `id` - Agent ID (e.g., `agent-abc123`)
- `name` - Agent name
- `description` - Agent description
- `tags` - Agent tags
- `blocks` - Memory blocks (if `--include-blocks` used)

## Related Skills

- **migrating-memory** - Once you find an agent, use this skill to copy/share memory blocks
- **searching-messages** - Search messages across all agents to find which agent discussed a topic. Use `--all-agents` to get `agent_id` values, then use this skill to get full agent details.

### Finding Agents by Topic

If you need to find which agent worked on a specific topic:

1. Load both skills: `searching-messages` and `finding-agents`
2. Search messages across all agents:
   ```bash
   letta messages search --query "topic" --all-agents --limit 10
   ```
3. Note the `agent_id` values from matching messages
4. Get agent details:
   ```bash
   letta agents list --query "partial-name"
   ```
   Or use the agent_id directly in the Letta API
