description: Write or change Home Assistant YAML — automations, scripts, scenes, templates, integrations, packages, helpers. Covers checking current integration documentation before writing, the mandatory HA YAML style guide, reading and querying YAML with yq, safe writes through write_config_safe, validation, backups, and whether a change needs a reload or a restart. Load this before editing any file under /homeassistant. Use when this capability is needed.

# Home Assistant configuration work

The consent rules in `AGENTS.md` apply to everything here: show the change,
wait for explicit approval, change nothing else.

## Before you write anything

Home Assistant ships a release every month, with new options, deprecations and
breaking changes. Training data goes stale fast, so verify syntax against the
running version rather than recalling it.

1. `get_config` — which Home Assistant version is this?
2. `get_integration_docs("<integration>")` — current YAML syntax and examples.
3. `get_breaking_changes` — when something stopped working after an update.
4. Read the existing file in full. Every write replaces the whole file.

Frequently-changed areas worth double-checking:

- Template sensors: `platform: template` under `sensor:` is deprecated — use the
  top-level `template:` key.
- MQTT: `platform: mqtt` under a domain key is deprecated — use top-level `mqtt:`.
- Service targeting: `entity_id` at action level or inside `data:` is deprecated
  — use `target:`.
- Direct state access: `states.sensor.x.state` is fragile — use `states('sensor.x')`.
- Many integrations moved from YAML to UI-only configuration.

## Writing safely

`write_config_safe` is the sanctioned write path. It validates, backs up, blocks
writes that would drop list entries or top-level keys or shrink a file
suspiciously, and restores on failure.

```
1. get_config()                                -> installed version
2. get_integration_docs("template")            -> current syntax
3. read the existing file                      -> ALL of it
4. draft: existing content + your change
5. write_config_safe(path, yaml, dry_run=true) -> pre-validate
6. fix and repeat 5 until clean
7. show the user, wait for approval
8. write_config_safe(path, yaml)               -> write for real
```

**Never write partial content to a config file.** Read first, include everything
that was already there. `write_config_safe` blocks the worst cases, but the
draft you show the user must already be complete.

If the `write_config_safe` tool is not present, the add-on is running a reduced
MCP tool profile. Say so rather than falling back to shell redirection.

## Reading and querying YAML from the shell

Use **`yq`** (the mikefarah Go tool, on `PATH`). It tolerates Home Assistant's
custom tags — `!include`, `!secret`, `!env_var`, `!input`, `!include_dir_*`.
**PyYAML and Ruby's YAML crash on the first `!include`**, so do not reach for
`python3 -c "import yaml"`.

```
yq '.homeassistant.latitude' configuration.yaml   # nested value
yq '.automation | tag' configuration.yaml         # the tag itself -> !include
yq 'keys' configuration.yaml                      # top-level keys
yq -o=json '.' configuration.yaml | jq '.sensor'  # pipe into jq
```

Output and JSON conversion strip tags — `!secret home_latitude` prints as
`home_latitude`. Use `| tag` when the tag matters. **Never round-trip a file
through JSON and back**; every `!include`/`!secret` is lost permanently.

Prefer `write_config_safe` or the editor for changes. `yq -i` is for quick,
low-risk edits only, with two caveats:

1. **A custom tag sticks to the value you overwrite.**
   `yq -i '.homeassistant.latitude = 52.37'` on a `!secret` node yields the
   corrupt `latitude: !secret 52.37`. Reset the tag in the same expression:
   ```
   yq -i '(.homeassistant.latitude tag = "") | .homeassistant.latitude = 52.37' configuration.yaml
   ```
   To *add* a secret reference:
   `yq -i '.http.api_key = "my_api_key" | .http.api_key tag = "!secret"' configuration.yaml`
2. **`yq -i` strips blank separator lines** across the whole file. Nothing is
   lost, but diffs get noisy. Use the editor when a clean diff matters.

`yq` only proves the YAML parses. To validate a Home Assistant *configuration*
— resolving `!include`/`!secret`, checking integration schemas — use
`check_config_syntax` or `write_config_safe`.

## YAML style guide (mandatory)

All YAML written or modified MUST follow the official
[Home Assistant YAML style guide](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/documenting/yaml-style-guide/).
Prettier is configured here and auto-formats on save, but it only enforces a
subset — the rules marked `*` are yours to apply.

- **Indentation**: 2 spaces. Tabs forbidden.
- **Booleans** `*`: lowercase `true` / `false` only. Never `Yes`, `On`, `TRUE`.
- **Strings**: double quotes. No single quotes. **Exceptions** (leave unquoted):
  entity IDs, area IDs, device IDs, platform types, trigger/condition types,
  action names, device classes, event names, attribute names, and fixed-set
  values such as `mode`.
- **Sequences** `*`: block style, indented under their key. No `[1, 2, 3]`, and
  no list items sitting at the key's own indent.
- **Mappings** `*`: block style. No `{ key: val }`.
- **Null** `*`: implicit — just `key:` with no value. Never `null` or `~`.
- **Comments**: `# ` then a capital, indented to the current level.
- **Multiline**: literal `|` or folded `>`. Avoid `\n` inside quoted strings.
  Prefer no-chomp (`|`, `>`) unless you need strip (`|-`, `>-`).
- **Templates**: double quotes outside, single inside. Use `states()`,
  `state_attr()`, `is_state()` — not `states.sensor.x.state`. Split long
  templates over multiple lines with `>-`.
- **Service targets** `*`: always `target:`. Never `entity_id` at action level
  or inside `data:`.
- **Scalar vs list** `*`: a single value stays a scalar; do not wrap it in a
  list, and never use a comma-separated string.
- **List of mappings** `*`: properties that accept a mapping or a list of them
  (`actions`, `conditions`) always take a list, even for one item.

```yaml
# Good
actions:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
    data:
      brightness: 200
      message: "Hello!"

# Bad
actions:
  action: "light.turn_on"
  entity_id: light.living_room
```

## What lives where

- `configuration.yaml` — main file
- `automations.yaml`, `scripts.yaml`, `scenes.yaml`, `groups.yaml`,
  `customize.yaml` — split config, usually UI-managed
- `secrets.yaml` — never display, never copy a value out of it
- `packages/` — package-based splits; `blueprints/`; `themes/`; `www/` (served
  at `/local/`); `custom_components/`
- `.storage/`, `.cloud/`, `deps/`, `tts/`, `home-assistant_v2.db`,
  `home-assistant.log` — off-limits, use MCP tools instead

Know the `!include` family: `!include`, `!include_dir_named`,
`!include_dir_list`, `!include_dir_merge_named`, `!include_dir_merge_list`.
Use anchors (`&name`) and aliases (`*name`) for DRY configuration, and packages
when a feature spans several domains.

## Creating an automation

1. Read the whole existing `automations.yaml` — your write must contain all of it.
2. Identify the trigger, the conditions, and the entities involved
   (`search_entities` / `get_home_context` if you need to find them).
3. Draft the YAML with comments explaining anything non-obvious.
4. Show the draft — the complete file — and wait for approval.
5. Write with `write_config_safe`.
6. Suggest how to test it.

Triggers: state, time, time_pattern, event, webhook, mqtt, template, zone,
device, numeric_state. Conditions: state, numeric_state, time, template, zone,
and/or/not. Actions: service calls, `delay`, `wait_template`, `choose`,
`repeat`, `if/then/else`. Trigger variables (`trigger.to_state`,
`trigger.from_state`, `trigger.entity_id`) and `continue_on_error` are worth
reaching for.

## Applying the change

Ask before doing any of these, and say plainly which one is needed:

| Change | What it takes |
|---|---|
| `automations.yaml`, `scripts.yaml`, `scenes.yaml` | Reload that domain — no restart |
| Template entities, most helper YAML | Reload the domain |
| `configuration.yaml` integration blocks | Usually a **restart** |
| New custom component in `custom_components/` | **Restart** |
| `secrets.yaml` values | Restart whatever reads them |

A restart drops every automation mid-run and takes the instance offline for a
minute or more. Never restart without asking, and say why it is needed.

Before anything large: `hab backup create`, or `get_backup_posture` to check how
recent the last backup is. Validate first with `check_config_syntax` or
`validate_config` — a failed restart on a broken configuration is the one
outcome worth real effort to avoid.
