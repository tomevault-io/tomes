# Brainstorming Capture

Capture story brainstorming in working note format that preserves creative freedom.

## Core Principle

Record brainstorming WITHOUT:
- Over-elaborating on what was stated
- Mixing user statements with AI suggestions unmarked
- Inventing excessive details
- Constraining future creativity

**AI suggestions are valuable but must be clearly marked and kept minimal.**

## Types of Brainstorming

This skill handles all brainstorming types:
- Story/plot directions (general narrative exploration)
- Chapter structure and beats (planning individual chapters)
- Worldbuilding and lore (magic systems, cultures, history, geography)
- Character development (motivations, arcs, relationships)
- Timeline and continuity (chronology, contradictions)

All share core principles (minimal capture, source tagging, preserve vagueness).
See references/ for specialized guidance:
- `chapter-planning.md` - Capturing beat and scene exploration
- `worldbuilding.md` - Exploring fictional world elements (use web search for research)
- `character-development.md` - Exploring motivations, arcs, relationships
- `continuity-timeline.md` - Timeline tracking and contradiction handling

## Critical Rules

### 1. Minimal Capture Only

Record ONLY what the user explicitly states. Do NOT add elaborations, examples they didn't give, or details to fill gaps.

**The problem is mixing, not suggesting:**

❌ User: "Character A competes with B" → Capture: "A and B compete for leadership through a tournament with three rounds..."
✅ User: "Character A competes with B" → Capture: "A and B compete" + optional: "<AI>Tournament? Political? Trial?</AI>"

### 2. Source Tagging (Simple 3-Tag System)

**Default: Untagged = user said it.** Most ideas come from the user, so treat them as the default.

**ONLY use tags for special context:**

1. **`<AI>...</AI>`** - AI suggestions/possibilities (MUST be clearly wrapped)
   - Use when offering ideas user didn't state
   - Keep to 2-3 brief options
   - Example: `<AI>Competition could be: tournament-style, political maneuvering, or trial-based</AI>`

2. **`<hidden>...</hidden>`** - Author-only information meant to be revealed later
   - Secret character motivations
   - Planned twists/revelations
   - Behind-the-scenes reasons unknown to characters/readers yet
   - Example: `<hidden>Z secretly wants them both to fail so he can reclaim leadership</hidden>`

**When to offer AI suggestions:**
- User asks for ideas
- User seems stuck
- Offering brief possibilities to spark creativity

**When to stay minimal:**
- User is actively exploring their own ideas
- Just capturing an ongoing discussion
- User didn't ask for suggestions

### 3. Preserve Vagueness

Keep it vague if user leaves it vague:
- "might create tension" → Record as uncertain
- "thinking about" → Record as consideration
- "maybe" → Record as possibility

### 4. Multiple Options Coexist

Working notes can contain contradictions and multiple possibilities. Don't resolve them - just list the options being considered.

## Output Approach

**Use whatever structure fits the discussion.** Could be:
- Bullet lists
- Sections organized by topic
- Timeline format
- Character-focused groupings
- Whatever captures the brainstorm clearly

**Essential elements:**
- Minimal capture (user's words, not elaborations)
- Vagueness preserved
- AI suggestions wrapped in `<AI>` tags
- Author-only info wrapped in `<hidden>` tags when relevant

**Optional sections based on discussion:**
- Open questions to explore
- Multiple options being considered
- AI suggestions (if offered)
- Contradictions to resolve later

## Teaching Example: The Distinction

### User Says:
"I'm thinking character X and character Y compete for leadership. Maybe this creates tension with character Z who was the previous leader."

### ✅ Good Capture:
```markdown
# Leadership Competition Notes

- X and Y compete for leadership
- Z was previous leader
- May create tension with Z (uncertain)

Open questions:
- Form of competition?
- How does Z respond?
- Outcome?
```

### ❌ Bad Capture:
```markdown
# Leadership Competition Arc

X and Y compete for leadership after Z steps down. Z feels threatened by the challenge to his authority.

The competition unfolds in three stages:
1. Announcement and initial positioning
2. First challenge where X demonstrates strength
3. Second challenge where Y shows wisdom
...
[20 more invented beats]
```

**Why bad?** Added massive elaboration the user never stated.

### ✅ Good with AI Suggestions:
```markdown
# Leadership Competition Notes

- X and Y compete for leadership
- Z was previous leader
- May create tension with Z (uncertain)

Open questions:
- Competition format: <AI>tournament-style? political maneuvering? trial-based?</AI>
- Z's response: <AI>oppose both? support one? stay neutral?</AI>
- Resolution?
```

### ✅ Good with Hidden Author Notes:
```markdown
# Leadership Competition Notes

- X and Y compete for leadership
- Z was previous leader
- May create tension with Z (uncertain)
- <hidden>Z is secretly manipulating both X and Y to destroy each other, planning to reclaim power after they're both discredited</hidden>

Open questions:
- Competition format?
- Outcome?
```

**Why use `<hidden>`?** The manipulation twist is planned for later reveal. Readers/characters don't know yet, but the author needs to track it while brainstorming.

## If You're Over-Elaborating

**Stop if you're writing:**
- Numbered scene lists
- Detailed backstories
- Specific dialogue
- Precise timelines
- Multiple paragraphs per point
- Examples user didn't mention

Wrap AI suggestions in `<AI>` tags, keep minimal (2-3 options).

## Success Check

**Good:** User says "Yes, that's what I said"
**Bad:** User says "I never said all that"

Notes should feel skeletal and incomplete. That's the point - preserves creative freedom.

## After Capturing: Discuss and Explore

**DON'T just write notes and stop.** After capturing, engage with the user to help develop ideas:

**Useful follow-ups:**
- **Clarifying questions:** "You mentioned tension with Z - are you thinking internal conflict or external confrontation?"
- **Potential directions:** "This setup could go a few ways: political intrigue, personal drama, or action-focused. What feels right?"
- **Exploring implications:** "If Z opposes them both, how does that change the power dynamics?"
- **Connecting threads:** "This competition ties into the earlier succession crisis you mentioned - want to explore that link?"

**Keep it conversational:**
- Offer 2-3 possibilities, not exhaustive lists
- Ask about what excites the user
- Help clarify vague ideas without over-defining them
- Point out interesting implications or contradictions

**The goal:** Help the user think through their ideas, not take over the creative process.

## Skills are Composable

Feel free to combine with other skills when helpful (e.g., using cw-official-docs to document finalized worldbuilding, or cw-story-critique to analyze what you're brainstorming).

## File Placement (Claude Code)

1. Check project docs for conventions
2. Look at where similar content lives
3. Place near related content
4. Name: `brainstorm-[topic].md`
5. Ask if unclear
