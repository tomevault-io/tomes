When the user wants to **set up automations**, **create recurring workflows**, **schedule something**, or **set a reminder**, apply these principles:

## How Tasks Work

A task is an ordered list of **prompts** executed sequentially in a dedicated thread. Each step sees the full conversation history from earlier steps, so step 2 can reference, analyse, or build on the output of step 1. This is the core power — **prompt chaining** turns simple instructions into complex multi-turn workflows.

There are three task types:
- **Multi-step prompt tasks** — the agent executes each prompt in order, accumulating context. Use for research, reports, gather-then-summarise workflows.
- **Notify-only tasks** — fire a desktop/channel notification with no agent invocation. Use for simple reminders and timers.
- **One-shot timers** — use `delay_minutes` for quick "remind me in 30 minutes" requests. These auto-delete after firing.

## Prompt Chaining — The Core Pattern

1. **Chain Steps That Build on Each Other** — Design prompts so each step uses the output of the previous one. Example:
   - Step 1: *"Search for the latest news about AI regulation in the EU"*
   - Step 2: *"Now summarise the key findings from above into 5 bullet points with source links"*
   - Step 3: *"Draft a short email to my team highlighting the top 3 developments"*

   Step 2 works because it can see step 1's search results in the conversation. Step 3 works because it can see the summary.

2. **Write Prompts Like Briefings** — State the goal, specify what to check, and describe the desired format. Vague prompts produce vague results. Each prompt should make it clear what the agent should do in *that* step.

3. **Conditional Logic in Prompts** — Write prompts that handle "nothing found" gracefully:
   *"Check for calendar events tomorrow. If there are none, just say 'Clear schedule tomorrow.' If there are events, list them with times and highlight any conflicts."*

4. **Use Template Variables** — `{{date}}`, `{{day}}`, `{{time}}`, `{{month}}`, `{{year}}` make prompts context-aware at runtime. *"Summarise news for {{date}}"* produces different results each day.

## When to Use One Task vs. Multiple Tasks

5. **One multi-step task** when the steps form a pipeline — each step needs the previous step's output. A research task that searches → reads sources → synthesises → formats is one task.
6. **Separate tasks** when the workflows are independent — a morning weather check and an inbox summary don't need each other's output. Separate tasks let the user enable, disable, schedule, or deliver them independently.
7. **Morning stack pattern** — For daily routines, create separate tasks for each piece (weather, news, calendar, project status). The user can toggle individual pieces on/off and schedule them at different times.

## Scheduling

8. **Match the schedule to the rhythm:**
   - `daily:HH:MM` — briefings, digests, check-ins
   - `weekly:DAY:HH:MM` — reviews, summaries, reports
   - `interval:H` / `interval_minutes:M` — monitoring, polling, frequent checks
   - `cron:EXPR` — complex schedules (e.g. `cron:0 9 * * mon-fri` for weekdays only)

## Delivery & Notification

9. **Pick the right channel** — Telegram for mobile-friendly results the user needs on the go, email for reports others need to see, desktop notification (`notify_only`) for simple nudges.
10. **Ask before defaulting** — Don't assume a delivery channel. Ask how the user wants to receive results. Some automations are better consumed on-demand.

## Advanced Features

11. **Model override** — Use the `model` parameter to run a specific task on a different model (e.g. a heavier model for complex research, a lighter one for quick checks).
12. **Persistent threads** — By default each run gets a fresh thread (`persistent_thread=false`). Set `persistent_thread=true` when the task needs to see results from prior runs — e.g. monitoring/polling tasks that compare against previous values, project trackers that build on earlier summaries, or any task where cross-run context matters. The system auto-generates and manages the thread ID.
13. **Skills override** — Assign specific skills to a task so it runs with a tailored skill set regardless of the user's global skill settings.

## Pipeline Mode (Advanced Steps)

Pipeline mode replaces simple prompt lists with typed steps for complex workflows. Use `steps` instead of `prompts` when you need conditional branching, approval gates, subtasks, or notifications.

### Step Types

- **prompt** — Execute an agent prompt. Supports `{{prev_output}}` and `{{step.<id>.output}}` for data passing between steps. Optional: `on_error` (stop/skip), `max_retries`, `retry_delay_seconds`.
- **condition** — Evaluate a condition on the previous step's output and branch. Fields: `condition` (expression), `if_true` (step ID to jump to), `if_false` (step ID or "end"). Operators: `contains:X`, `not_contains:X`, `equals:X`, `matches:REGEX`, `gt:N`, `lt:N`, `empty`, `not_empty`, `true`, `false`, `json:path:operator:value`, `llm:question`, `and:[...]`, `or:[...]`.
- **approval** — Pause the pipeline and wait for human approval before continuing. Fields: `message`, `timeout_minutes` (0 = wait forever, default 30). The user approves or denies from the Activity tab.
- **subtask** — Run another task inline as a sub-pipeline (max depth 2). Fields: `task_id`, `pass_output` (bool, pass previous output as input).
- **notify** — Send a notification without agent invocation. Fields: `message`, `channel` (desktop/telegram/email).

### Choosing the Right Condition Operator

- **`llm:question`** — Best for natural language output. An LLM evaluates the question against the previous step's output and returns yes/no. Use when the output is free-form text (e.g. `llm:Were any relevant results found?`). Most reliable for ambiguous output.
- **`contains:X` / `not_contains:X`** — Keyword match. Good for structured output or sentinel values.
- **`empty` / `not_empty`** — Only when the step literally returns nothing on failure.
- **`equals:X`** — Exact string match. Only reliable when the prompt is engineered to output a specific sentinel value (e.g. `"If no results, output exactly: NO_RESULTS"`).
- **`json:path:operator:value`** — For structured JSON output with dot-path access.
- **`and:[...]` / `or:[...]`** — Combine multiple operators.

### Data Passing Between Steps

Each step's output is captured. Use template variables to reference it in later steps:
- `{{prev_output}}` — the output of the immediately preceding step.
- `{{step.prompt_1.output}}` — the output of the step with ID `prompt_1`.

Step IDs are auto-generated as `{type}_{counter}` — e.g. `prompt_1`, `condition_1`, `prompt_2`, `notify_1`. Do NOT provide an `id` field; it is assigned automatically based on step type and position.

### Flow Control with `next`

All step types accept an optional `next` field to override the default linear advancement:
- `"next": "step_id"` — jump to a specific step after this one completes.
- `"next": "end"` — terminate the pipeline after this step.

This is essential for branching workflows: when a condition branches to an if_true path, the last step of that branch should use `"next": "end"` to prevent fall-through into the if_false path.

### Safety Modes

Every task has a `safety_mode` that controls access to destructive tools (shell commands, file writes, emails, calendar changes):
- `block` (default) — destructive tools are removed entirely. Safest for automated runs.
- `approve` — destructive tools are available, but the pipeline pauses for human approval before executing them. The user approves from the Activity tab.
- `allow_all` — no restrictions. Use only for trusted, well-tested pipelines.

### Pipeline Step Examples

```python
# Search → Condition → Branch → Approve → Notify
# Step IDs are auto-assigned: prompt_1, condition_1, notify_1, prompt_2, approval_1, notify_2
steps = [
    {"type": "prompt", "prompt": "Search for breaking news about {{topic}}"},
    {"type": "condition", "condition": "llm:Were any relevant results found?",
     "if_true": "prompt_2", "if_false": "notify_1"},
    {"type": "notify", "message": "No results for {{topic}}.", "channel": "desktop",
     "next": "end"},
    {"type": "prompt", "prompt": "Summarize: {{step.prompt_1.output}}"},
    {"type": "approval", "message": "Send this summary to the team?"},
    {"type": "notify", "message": "{{step.prompt_2.output}}", "channel": "telegram"},
]
```

**Key patterns in this example:**
- `llm:` condition operator for intelligent evaluation of free-text search output
- `notify_1` has `"next": "end"` to stop the pipeline after the "no results" branch — without this, execution would fall through into `prompt_2`
- `if_true` jumps to `prompt_2`, skipping the "no results" notify
- Approval gate before sending via Telegram

### When to Use Pipeline vs. Simple Prompts

- **Simple prompts** for linear workflows where each step just needs conversation context.
- **Pipeline steps** when you need: branching logic, approval gates before destructive actions, reusable subtask composition, explicit data routing between steps, or per-step error handling.

## Maintenance

14. **Check first** — Before creating a new task, check `task_list` to avoid duplicates or overlapping schedules.
15. **Test immediately** — Always suggest `task_run_now` after creation so the user can verify the output before waiting for the first scheduled run.
16. **Iterate prompts** — If the output isn't right, update the prompts with `task_update` rather than deleting and recreating.

## Monitoring / Polling

When the user wants to **monitor a condition** and be notified when it changes ("check X and tell me when Y", "alert me if Z drops below W"), use the **interval + self-disable** pattern:

17. **Use an interval schedule** — `interval_minutes:M` for frequent checks (stock availability, price drops) or `interval:H` for slower checks (daily digest changes).

18. **Write a conditional prompt** — The prompt should:
    - Check the condition (e.g. search the web, read a URL, check a price)
    - If the condition IS met → report the finding and self-disable with `task_update(task_id='{{task_id}}', enabled=false)`
    - If the condition is NOT met → say so briefly (this keeps the persistent thread informed without wasting tokens)

19. **Always set `persistent_thread=true`** — This lets the agent see prior checks across runs. Essential for "notify me if the price drops below X" (needs to compare to last check) or "tell me when there's a new version" (needs to know the old version). The system auto-generates the thread ID — just pass the boolean flag.

20. **Template: polling prompt pattern** —
    ```
    Search for [condition]. If [success criteria], report your findings
    and call task_update(task_id='{{task_id}}', enabled=false) to stop
    this monitor. If [condition not met], say '[thing] not yet
    available as of {{time}} — will check again.'
    ```

21. **Self-disable, don't self-delete** — Background tasks cannot delete themselves (safety restriction). Use `task_update(enabled=false)` instead. The user can re-enable, delete, or leave the disabled task.
