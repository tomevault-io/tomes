When the user asks to **use Claude Code**, **coordinate Claude Code**, **delegate coding work**, **have another coding agent implement/review/refactor something**, or compares Row-Bot with Hermes-style Claude Code orchestration, use this workflow.

You are the coordinator. Claude Code is the delegated coding worker. Keep ownership of the user's goal, safety boundaries, summary, follow-up checks, and final explanation.

## Core Principles

1. **Prefer print mode first** — Use `claude -p` for most tasks. It runs one bounded task, returns output, and exits. This works well with Row-Bot's `run_command` tool and avoids interactive terminal state.
2. **Keep Row-Bot in charge** — Do not hand off the whole conversation. Give Claude Code a clear task, collect its result, inspect what changed, run appropriate checks, and report back to the user.
3. **Use the Shell tool deliberately** — Use `run_command` for Claude Code CLI calls. Row-Bot's shell tool persists the working directory per conversation and approval-gates non-safe commands.
4. **Set the project directory explicitly** — Before delegating, confirm or set the repo directory with `pwd` / `Get-Location` and `cd` / `Set-Location`. Claude Code resume and context behaviour depend on the current directory.
5. **Constrain autonomy** — Always use limits such as `--allowedTools`, `--max-turns`, and, when available, `--max-budget-usd` for print-mode tasks.
6. **Avoid permission bypass** — Do not use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` unless the user explicitly asks and understands that Claude Code may edit files and run commands without per-action prompts.
7. **Do not forward secrets** — Never include API keys, tokens, Row-Bot memory, private notes, or sensitive user data in a Claude Code prompt unless the user explicitly asks for that specific context to be shared.

## Prerequisite Checks

Before the first delegation in a project or session, check whether Claude Code is available and authenticated:

```text
claude --version
claude auth status
claude doctor
```

If these fail, explain the setup path briefly:

```text
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude auth login
```

On Windows, native print-mode CLI usage may work if `claude` is installed on PATH. For interactive/tmux-style orchestration, recommend WSL2 unless native terminal support has been verified.

## Delegation Workflow

1. **Understand the task** — Restate the requested coding outcome, target repo/path, and expected verification. Ask one clarifying question only if the target or risk level is unclear.
2. **Inspect local state first** — Use safe shell commands such as `git status`, `git diff`, and directory listing commands before delegation. Notice uncommitted user changes and do not overwrite them.
3. **Choose capability scope** — Pick the narrowest Claude Code tool set for the task:
   - Review/explain only: `--allowedTools "Read"`
   - Edit existing files: `--allowedTools "Read,Edit"`
   - Create files/tests: `--allowedTools "Read,Edit,Write"`
   - Run tests/builds: `--allowedTools "Read,Edit,Write,Bash"`
4. **Ask for approval when needed** — A Claude Code run that can edit files or run shell commands is write-capable delegation. If the user did not already authorize that, confirm before running it.
5. **Run Claude Code in print mode** — Use a bounded command with a concise prompt, explicit limits, and JSON output when useful.
6. **Inspect the result** — After Claude Code exits, run `git status` and inspect the diff. Do not assume the delegated agent did the right thing.
7. **Verify** — Run targeted tests, lint, type checks, or smoke checks appropriate to the change. If verification is expensive or unclear, ask before running broad suites.
8. **Report clearly** — Summarize what Claude Code changed, what you verified, any failures or uncertainties, and recommended next steps.

## Print-Mode Command Patterns

Use these as patterns, adapting quoting for the user's shell. In Row-Bot, it is often cleaner to set the directory first, then run `claude` as a separate command so the shell session cwd persists.

### Status and Setup

```text
claude --version
claude auth status
claude doctor
```

### Read-Only Review

```text
claude -p "Review the current repository changes for bugs, security issues, and missing tests. Do not edit files. Return findings with file paths and verification suggestions." --allowedTools "Read" --max-turns 3 --output-format json
```

### Focused Edit

```text
claude -p "Implement the requested fix in the smallest safe change. Preserve existing style. After editing, summarize changed files and tests to run." --allowedTools "Read,Edit" --max-turns 8 --max-budget-usd 2 --output-format json
```

### Feature Work With Tests

```text
claude -p "Implement this feature and add focused tests. Prefer minimal, idiomatic changes. Run the relevant tests if safe. Return a summary, files changed, tests run, and any remaining risks." --allowedTools "Read,Edit,Write,Bash" --max-turns 12 --max-budget-usd 4 --output-format json
```

### Diff Review

```text
git diff --stat
git diff | claude -p "Review this diff for correctness, regressions, security issues, and missing tests. Do not edit files." --allowedTools "Read" --max-turns 1
```

If the diff is large, save a focused patch file for Claude Code to inspect, but avoid including secrets or unrelated local changes. Remember that Claude Code cannot see Row-Bot's previous tool output unless you pass the relevant context into the Claude Code prompt, stdin, files, or repository state.

## Prompt Construction

Give Claude Code a compact brief:

```text
Goal: <specific outcome>
Repo/path: <current directory or subpath>
Constraints: preserve user changes, follow existing patterns, avoid broad refactors
Allowed work: <read-only | edit existing files | create tests | run tests>
Verification: <specific commands or ask it to identify tests>
Output: summary, files changed, tests run, remaining risks
```

Do not ask Claude Code to make commits, push branches, publish releases, delete data, rotate secrets, or run production-affecting commands unless the user explicitly requested that operation.

## Session Continuation

When using `--output-format json`, capture the returned `session_id` if Claude Code provides one. Use resume only when continuing the same task in the same project directory:

```text
claude -p "Continue from the previous session and address the remaining test failure." --resume <session_id> --max-turns 5 --allowedTools "Read,Edit,Bash"
```

Use `--continue` only when you are sure the most recent Claude Code session in the current directory is the one you want. If unsure, start a fresh print-mode task instead.

## Worktree Mode

For larger or risky edits, prefer isolating Claude Code's work in a branch or worktree when available:

```text
claude -p "Implement the feature in an isolated worktree and summarize the diff." --worktree row-bot-delegation-task --allowedTools "Read,Edit,Write,Bash" --max-turns 12 --max-budget-usd 4
```

Afterward, inspect the worktree diff before merging or copying changes back. Do not merge or delete worktrees without user approval.

## Interactive Mode Is Advanced

Interactive Claude Code is useful for long, multi-turn coding sessions, Claude Code slash commands, and human-in-the-loop exploration. It is also more fragile.

Use interactive mode only when print mode is insufficient. Prefer macOS/Linux/WSL2 with `tmux` for reliable monitoring:

```text
tmux new-session -d -s claude-work -x 140 -y 40
tmux send-keys -t claude-work 'cd /path/to/project; claude' Enter
tmux capture-pane -t claude-work -p -S -50
tmux send-keys -t claude-work 'Now add focused regression tests' Enter
tmux send-keys -t claude-work '/exit' Enter
tmux kill-session -t claude-work
```

Rules for interactive mode:

- Prefer WSL2 on Windows for tmux-based orchestration.
- Monitor with `tmux capture-pane` before assuming the session is stuck.
- Look for a prompt or clear waiting state before sending follow-up input.
- Clean up tmux sessions when done.
- Do not leave background coding agents running silently.

## Safety Boundaries

- Treat Claude Code as a powerful external actor that can edit the repo and spend API quota.
- Use `--allowedTools` every time.
- Use `--max-turns` for print mode every time.
- Use `--max-budget-usd` for non-trivial tasks when available.
- Avoid broad filesystem access with `--add-dir` unless required.
- Avoid `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` and `--dangerously-skip-permissions` by default.
- Do not run destructive git commands, force pushes, deploys, production migrations, or secret-handling tasks through Claude Code without explicit user approval.
- Respect Row-Bot background workflow safety modes: write-capable Claude Code runs should not happen in unattended background tasks unless the user selected an approval or allow-all mode for that task.

## After Delegation

Always follow up with Row-Bot-native review:

1. Run `git status`.
2. Inspect changed files or the diff.
3. Run relevant tests/checks if appropriate.
4. Tell the user:
   - what Claude Code attempted,
   - what changed,
   - what passed or failed,
   - what still needs human review.

If Claude Code fails, times out, hits a budget/turn limit, or produces ambiguous output, do not keep retrying blindly. Summarize the failure, narrow the prompt, reduce tool scope if possible, and ask before another write-capable run.
