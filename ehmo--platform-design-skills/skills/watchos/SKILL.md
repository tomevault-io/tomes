# watchOS Design Guidelines

## Purpose

This skill provides Apple Human Interface Guidelines for Apple Watch. Load it when working on watchOS apps, complications, workout features, or any wrist-based interaction design.

## When to Use

- Building or reviewing watchOS app interfaces
- Designing complications for watch faces
- Implementing Digital Crown interactions
- Creating workout or health tracking features
- Designing notifications for Apple Watch
- Evaluating glanceability of Watch UI
- Working with Always On display states

## File Structure

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `SKILL.md` | Complete design rules, specifications, and evaluation checklist |
| `rules/_sections.md` | All rules organized by category with IDs for cross-reference |
| `metadata.json` | Version, references, and abstract |

## Key Principles

1. **Glanceable first** -- every screen must communicate its purpose within 2 seconds
2. **Respect the wrist** -- interactions should be brief; avoid complex multi-step flows
3. **Digital Crown is primary** -- scroll, select, and adjust values with the Crown
4. **Complications drive engagement** -- keep watch face data fresh and useful
5. **Always On awareness** -- dim gracefully, hide sensitive content

## Rule Categories

| # | Category | Priority |
|---|----------|----------|
| 1 | Glanceable Design | CRITICAL |
| 2 | Digital Crown | HIGH |
| 3 | Navigation | HIGH |
| 4 | Complications | HIGH |
| 5 | Always On Display | MEDIUM |
| 6 | Workouts & Health | MEDIUM |
| 7 | Notifications | MEDIUM |
| 8 | Accessibility | CRITICAL |

## Priority Reference

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| CRITICAL | Glanceable design, accessibility -- violations make the app unusable on Watch |
| HIGH | Digital Crown, navigation, complications -- core Watch interaction patterns |
| MEDIUM | Always On, workouts, notifications -- important but context-dependent |

## Never Do

- Never place primary information off-screen (requires scrolling to see)
- Never ignore the Digital Crown for scrollable or value-picking content
- Never override system Crown behaviors (volume, Time Travel)
- Never support only one complication family
- Never use deprecated ClockKit APIs -- use WidgetKit complication families
- Never show sensitive health data in the Always On dimmed state
- Never omit accessibility labels on image-only interactive elements
- Never use laggy or batched responses to Crown rotation
