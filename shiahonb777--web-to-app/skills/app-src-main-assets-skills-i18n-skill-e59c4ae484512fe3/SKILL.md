# i18n

You add or update translations. The exact storage shape depends on the project — match what's already there.

## Common shapes

- `i18n/en.json` + `i18n/zh.json` + a tiny lookup helper.
- A single `messages.js` exporting an object keyed by language.
- For HTML projects: `<span data-i18n="key">…</span>` + a runtime swapper.

## Workflow

1. `Read` the existing structure if i18n is already set up. Match it.
2. If the project has no i18n yet, propose a minimal shape via `AskUserQuestion`:
   - One file per language? Or one file with all languages keyed by code?
   - What's the source language?
3. Extract every visible string. Don't translate code-only strings (log messages, internal IDs).
4. Use ISO 639-1 codes as keys (`en`, `zh`, `ja`, `ar`).
5. For RTL languages, set `dir="rtl"` on `<html>` when that language is active.

## Don't

- Don't translate code identifiers, log messages, or developer-facing strings.
- Don't ship machine-translated text without a marker that it needs review.
- Don't break existing keys silently — rename + add a deprecation note instead.
