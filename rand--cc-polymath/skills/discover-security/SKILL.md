# Security Skills Discovery

Provides automatic access to comprehensive application security, vulnerability assessment, and security best practices skills.

## When This Skill Activates

This skill auto-activates when you're working with:
- Authentication and authorization systems
- Input validation and sanitization
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, CORS)
- Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- SQL injection, XSS, or other attack prevention
- Security hardening and compliance
- Password hashing and credential management
- API security and access control

## Available Skills

### Quick Reference

The Security category contains 6 specialized skills:

1. **authentication** - Authentication patterns (JWT, OAuth2, sessions, MFA, password security)
2. **authorization** - Access control (RBAC, ABAC, policy engines, permissions)
3. **input-validation** - Input validation and sanitization (SQL injection, XSS, command injection)
4. **security-headers** - HTTP security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, CORS)
5. **vulnerability-assessment** - Security testing (OWASP Top 10, scanning tools, pentesting)
6. **secrets-management** - Secrets handling (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, key rotation)

### Load Full Category Details

For complete descriptions and workflows:

Read ../security/INDEX.md


This loads the full Security category index with:
- Detailed skill descriptions

### Load Specific Skills

Load individual skills as needed:


# Identity and access
Read ../security/authentication.md
Read ../security/authorization.md

# Input security
Read ../security/input-validation.md
Read ../security/security-headers.md

# Security operations
Read ../security/vulnerability-assessment.md
Read ../security/secrets-management.md


## Common Workflows

### Secure Web Application
**Sequence**: Authentication → Authorization → Input validation → Security headers

Read ../security/authentication.md        # User login
Read ../security/authorization.md         # Access control
Read ../security/input-validation.md      # XSS/SQL injection prevention
Read ../security/security-headers.md      # Browser protection


### Security Audit
**Sequence**: Vulnerability assessment → Input validation → Headers → Secrets

Read ../security/vulnerability-assessment.md  # OWASP Top 10 testing
Read ../security/input-validation.md          # Injection testing
Read ../security/security-headers.md          # Header configuration
Read ../security/secrets-management.md        # Credential security


### API Security
**Sequence**: Authentication → Authorization → Input validation → Secrets

Read ../security/authentication.md        # JWT/OAuth2
Read ../security/authorization.md         # API access control
Read ../security/input-validation.md      # Request validation
Read ../security/secrets-management.md    # API key management


### DevSecOps Pipeline
**Sequence**: Vulnerability assessment → Secrets → Input validation

Read ../security/vulnerability-assessment.md  # Security scanning
Read ../security/secrets-management.md        # CI/CD secrets
Read ../security/input-validation.md          # SAST validation


### Secure New Application
**Full security implementation from scratch**:


# 1. Identity and access
Read ../security/authentication.md
Read ../security/authorization.md

# 2. Input protection
Read ../security/input-validation.md
Read ../security/security-headers.md

# 3. Operations
Read ../security/secrets-management.md
Read ../security/vulnerability-assessment.md

## Usage Instructions

1. **Auto-activation**: This skill loads automatically when Claude Code detects security-related work
2. **Browse skills**: Run `Read ../security/INDEX.md` for full category overview
3. **Load specific skills**: Use bash commands above to load individual skills
4. **Follow workflows**: Use recommended sequences for common security patterns
5. **Combine skills**: Load multiple skills for comprehensive security coverage

## Progressive Loading

This gateway skill (~200 lines, ~2K tokens) enables progressive loading:
- **Level 1**: Gateway loads automatically (you're here now)
- **Level 2**: Load category INDEX.md (~3K tokens) for full overview
- **Level 3**: Load specific skills (~2-4K tokens each) as needed

Total context: 2K + 3K + skill(s) = 5-12K tokens vs 30K+ for entire index.
