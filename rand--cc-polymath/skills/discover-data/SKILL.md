# Data Skills Discovery

Provides automatic access to comprehensive data skills.

## When This Skill Activates

This skill auto-activates when you're working with:
- ETL
- data pipelines
- batch processing
- stream processing
- data validation
- orchestration
- Airflow
- timely dataflow
- differential dataflow
- streaming aggregations
- windowing
- real-time analytics

## Available Skills

### Quick Reference

The Data category contains 9 skills:

1. **batch-processing** - Orchestrating complex data pipelines with dependencies
2. **data-validation** - Validating data schema before processing
3. **dataflow-coordination** - Coordination patterns for distributed dataflow systems
4. **differential-dataflow** - Differential computation for incremental updates and efficient joins
5. **etl-patterns** - Designing data extraction from multiple sources
6. **pipeline-orchestration** - Coordinating complex multi-step data workflows
7. **stream-processing** - Processing real-time event streams (Kafka, Flink)
8. **streaming-aggregations** - Windowing, sessionization, time-series aggregation
9. **timely-dataflow** - Low-latency streaming computation with progress tracking
