# AGENTS.md

> **See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for the canonical project reference** — 
> 1. Project Overview — intro + tech stack (merged, both are "what is this")
> 2. Development — commands, build/validation, testing, expected warnings (all "how to work on it")
> 3. Architecture — multi-process, IPC, sidecar, frontend structure, key source locations (all "how it's built")
> 4. Conventions & Patterns — settings UI, drag-and-drop, path aliases (all "patterns to follow")
> 5. Runtime Behavior — app startup, workspaces, skills manager, bundled resources (all "how it runs")
> 6. Reference — important notes, design docs (miscellaneous lookups)
> 7. Completion Checklist — stays last as the mandatory gate
>
> This file adds agent-specific guidance that supplements CLAUDE.md.

## Code Style and Conventions

This project uses **Ultracite** (Biome engine) for formatting and linting. Run `pnpm dlx ultracite fix src/ src-tauri/sidecar-opencode/` after every change.

### TypeScript

- Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed, never `var`
- Arrow functions for callbacks and short functions
- `for...of` over `.forEach()` and indexed `for` loops
- Optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) for safe property access
- Template literals over string concatenation
- Prefer `unknown` over `any`
- Always `await` promises in async functions
- Throw `Error` objects, not strings

### React

- Function components only (no class components)
- Hooks at the top level only, never conditionally
- Specify all hook dependency arrays correctly
- Use `key` prop with unique IDs (not array indices) in iterables
- Semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for accessibility
- React 19: use `ref` as a prop instead of `React.forwardRef`

### Sidecar Constraints

- Sidecar must use **CommonJS** (not ESM) — the `pkg` bundler fails with ESM
- Do not include `.js` extensions in TypeScript imports
- Binary is built with `@yao-pkg/pkg` targeting macOS ARM64

## Verification (MANDATORY before completing any task)

After TypeScript edits:
```bash
pnpm typecheck
```

After Rust edits:
```bash
cd src-tauri && cargo check
```

After any code change, run the formatter:
```bash
pnpm dlx ultracite fix src/ src-tauri/sidecar-opencode/
```

Do not report a task as complete until all applicable checks pass.

## Off-Limits

- Do not modify files in `src-tauri/binaries/` directly (these are built artifacts)
- Do not commit API keys, secrets, or `.env` files (keys are stored in OS Keychain)
- Do not use ESM syntax in sidecar code (`src-tauri/sidecar-opencode/`)
- Do not add `console.log`, `debugger`, or `alert` statements to production code
- Do not use dynamic code execution or raw HTML injection patterns
- Always sanitize and escape user-provided content before rendering
