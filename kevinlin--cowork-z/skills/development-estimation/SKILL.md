# Development Estimation

## Purpose

Create consistent, defensible estimates by:

- Triaging and clarifying scope (especially for bug lists)
- Decomposing work into deliverable components
- Accounting for testing, QA, and release overhead
- Identifying risks and unknowns with explicit mitigation
- Producing confidence-based ranges (P50/P80/P90)

Optimized for reviewing an existing project or backlog and producing a realistic delivery forecast.

## When to Use

- Estimating feature or project scope and delivery timelines
- Reviewing a backlog and producing a time estimate
- Producing risk-aware estimates with confidence intervals
- Converting a list of problems into an execution plan

## Avoid When

- The task is trivial and a gut-check is sufficient
- Requirements are unknown and discovery is the real work
- You lack access to the codebase or requirements

## Inputs Required

Provide as much as possible; estimate quality depends on clarity.

### Minimum

- List of items (bugs/features) with short descriptions
- Target platform/environment (e.g., iOS/Android/Web, staging/prod)
- Constraints (deadline, must-fix vs can-slip)

### Helpful

- Repro steps, logs, screenshots
- Architecture notes or codebase access
- Deployment pipeline and QA process
- Team capacity model (engineers, focus hours/day, meeting load)
- Definition of done (tests required, QA sign-off, release scope)

## Estimation Frames

Always confirm the estimate frame up front:

- Effort: engineer-days or engineer-weeks
- Calendar: derived from capacity (effort / throughput)
- Cost: optional, requires rate assumptions
- Complexity: t-shirt sizing or points (only if requested)

### Default Capacity Model

Unless provided, assume:

- 5–6 hours/day of effective build time per engineer
- Review and coordination overhead included per item
- QA/release overhead is stated explicitly as an assumption

## Triage Rubric (Bug Backlog)

For each bug, capture:

### Repro

- A: Always
- B: Sometimes / flaky
- C: Cannot repro / unclear

### Clarity

- A: Clear cause or clear fix path
- B: Partial (needs investigation)
- C: Unknown (needs discovery)

### Impact

- Blocker / High / Medium / Low

### Fix Type

- UI / Backend / Infra / Data / Dependency / Config / Unknown

### Risk Flags

- Concurrency / migrations / auth/security / payments / third-party API
- Performance / cross-platform behavior / state persistence
- Touches core path / unknown blast radius

Rule: If Repro=C or Clarity=C, include a discovery slice.

## Workflow

### 1) Define Scope and Estimate Type

- Confirm what is in/out of scope
- Confirm estimate type: effort, calendar, cost, complexity
- Confirm confidence target(s): P50 / P80 (default), optionally P90
- Confirm constraints: deadlines, must-fix items, release boundary

### 2) Intake and Normalize the Backlog

- De-duplicate issues
- Merge near-duplicates and note uncertainty
- Group items by subsystem (auth, billing, UI, sync, infra)
- Identify unknown-unknown areas (legacy zones, flaky tests, poor observability)

### 3) Per-Item Breakdown

Estimate each item using this structure:

- Triage / reproduce
- Investigation / diagnosis (if needed)
- Implementation
- Tests (unit/integration/e2e as appropriate)
- Code review and iteration
- QA verification
- Release / deployment steps (if applicable)

Use hours only for work expected to be under one day; otherwise use engineer-days.

### 4) Dependencies and Sequencing

- Identify dependencies (internal modules, data migrations, external APIs, app-store releases)
- Mark blockers and parallelizable streams
- Flag sequencing needs (must land before X)

### 5) Risks, Unknowns, and Buffers

Maintain an Unknowns Register:

- Unknown → discovery task → decision/validation method → timebox

Risk buffer guidance:

- Low risk: +0–10%
- Medium risk: +10–25%
- High risk: +25–50%
- Unknown-heavy: include discovery and a re-estimate gate

### 6) Roll-Up Totals and Confidence

Produce:

- Per-item ranges (min/most-likely/max or P50/P80)
- Totals by bucket (must/should/nice)
- Overall confidence:
  - P50: likely if things go normally
  - P80: realistic commitment range
  - P90: conservative range for high-stakes delivery

### 7) Validation and Re-Estimation Plan

Provide:

- Fastest validation steps to reduce uncertainty (logs, repro harness, spike)
- Re-estimation checkpoints (after discovery spikes, after first tranche)

## Output Format (Required)

### A) Executive Summary

- Scope statement (included/excluded)
- Estimate frame (effort vs calendar + capacity assumptions)
- Total estimates: P50 / P80 (and P90 if requested)
- Key risks and biggest unknowns

### B) Backlog Estimate Table

For each item:

- ID / Title
- Bucket (Must/Should/Nice)
- Subsystem
- Triage scores (Repro/Clarity/Impact)
- Estimate (P50/P80)
- Risk flags
- Notes / assumptions

### C) Totals by Bucket

- Must-fix total (P50/P80)
- Should-fix total (P50/P80)
- Nice-to-have total (P50/P80)

### D) Assumptions and Exclusions

- Explicit assumptions (env access, test maturity, release cadence)
- Explicit exclusions (UX redesign, perf overhaul, refactors unless listed)

### E) Risks and Unknowns Register

- Unknown → discovery plan → timebox → impact if true

### F) Next Steps

- Top 3 actions to validate quickly
- Proposed sequencing / milestones
- Re-estimation trigger points

## Common Mistakes

- Estimating a bug list as if it is already well-specified
- Skipping repro/triage and undercounting diagnosis time
- Ignoring testing, QA verification, and release overhead
- Mixing effort and calendar without a capacity model
- Overstating precision (single-number estimates with no confidence)
- Not separating must-fix from nice-to-have

## Quick Reference

- Preferred output: P50/P80 effort plus derived calendar via stated capacity
- Default unit: engineer-days (hours only for sub-day tasks)

## Quality Bar

A good estimate is:

- Transparent about assumptions
- Broken down into components
- Risk-aware with explicit unknown handling
- Delivered as a range with confidence levels
- Paired with a plan to validate and tighten the range
